        "selftext": " \n\n**CEO Performance Award Details**\n\nThe performance award consists of a 10-year grant of stock options  that vests in 12 tranches. Each of the 12 tranches vests only if a pair  of milestones are both met.\n\n* Market Cap Milestones: To meet the first market cap milestone, Tesla's current market cap must increase to $100 billion. For each of the remaining 11 milestones, Tesla's market cap must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments. Thus, for Elon to fully vest in the award, Tesla's market cap must increase to $650 billion.  \n \n* Operational Milestones: To meet the operational milestones, Tesla  must meet a set of escalating Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets (the  only adjustment to EBITDA is for stock-based compensation). These  milestones are even more directly aligned with shareholder value  creation than those used in Elon's 2012 performance award. They are  designed to ensure that as Tesla's market cap grows, the company is also  executing well on both a top-line and bottom-line basis.\n\nFor each of the 12 tranches that is achieved, Elon will vest in  stock options that correspond to 1% of Tesla's current total outstanding  shares (1% of that amount is approximately 1.69 million shares). If  none of the 12 tranches is achieved, Elon will not receive any  compensation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-announces-new-long-term-performance-award-elon-musk?ReleaseID=1054948](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-announces-new-long-term-performance-award-elon-musk?ReleaseID=1054948)",

        "selftext": "The year is 2017, my parents had a successful real estate business with over a dozen rental properties and several fix and flip projects in production. Our assets totaled a million and a half after paying off all loans if we ever liquidated everything. Which we did, and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nMy oldest brother made the brilliant decision that because he lost his job, he should start day trading. He quickly made $30k on Apple by yoloing his saving in shares before an Apple products release event. Excited by this, he made an entire PowerPoint presentation convincing the family to get into day trading. We were reluctant at first, and I wish it stayed that way.\n\nIn the background he worked with my parents in setting up a family company and opening trading accounts and buying courses. Keep in mind my parents will do anything he says, completely wrapped around his finger. During this time I was getting into the house flipping business in full swing. Working on my parents properties and going to auctions for future projects. I had already set up in my mind that I was going to be a real estate investor because it was the only work I actually enjoyed doing, my parents were very profitable, and even after the 2008 housing market crash, when we lost everything, they were able to bounce back.\nThen one day everything stopped, my parents stopped working real estate and with no capital of my own I couldn\u2019t continue doing it myself. \n\nThey liquidated most of their assets and set up trading accounts with TD. They tried setting up weekly quotas and profit targets, which looking back, were really unrealistic. We needed 20k per month and sometimes more to cover loans from the very last rentals that hadn\u2019t sold just yet. So naturally while they were on the market the quota for the month was 20k...for inexperienced day traders. It dawned on me that money is easy to make every month when a tenant gives it to you rather than we ourselves have to endure risk to make it, but my parents didn\u2019t listen to me, it had to be my brothers way.\n\nYou can probably guess what happened. Loss after loss made our account grow smaller and smaller; and the smaller it got the more we had to risk to make bigger profits. Which only happened once where I made nearly 50k trading Netflix on its highest volume day in 2018. That quickly gotten absorbed by bills. But. By 2018 we were already down some 200k and our bills had been quickly eating up our saving. All the way to the point we starting taking loans just cover expenses and continue trading. Then one day I lost 80k on netflix when it\u2019s earnings made it drop nearly a hundred dollars. If it went up well I\u2019d be into real estate again. I nearly had a heart attack and stayed in bed for I don\u2019t even know how long. If it weren\u2019t for my girlfriend I think I might have killed myself.\n\nWe were forced to live in our last property for a few months before selling it to avoid foreclosure and then my entire family moved into a 1 bedroom apartment my brother still had in Pasadena. Which is an urban city so the rent was 3k. Which was nearly impossible to pay. We did Uber Eats deliveries every single day to just try to make enough money to eat and did some trading with money we borrowed from our extended family. All of our credit scores were shot and there was nothing left to borrow on. Then we sold our very last property and made 100k on the sale. Which we lost.\n\nNearly all of our losses were on options, and they were a direct result of our trading strategy, which was laughable. They set guidelines for the option expiration, loss tolerance, and investment amount(no swing trading). Which hey sounds great why not. Except that when our expenses were so great, the low risk meant we were burning more than we were making, the stress made me make some good and bad trades in an attempt to save my family from ruin. On some trades I would have made literal hundreds of thousands if my parents and older brother didn\u2019t force sell my positions because they couldn\u2019t stomach swing a loss(16k in HD $215 strike bought at $201 and it reached $215 a day before expiration which would have been a $170k profit because instead was forced to be a $2k loss). It really kills your heart to see how much money you could have made, not because you took profits too early, because no one believed you and took a loss on your behalf.\n\nWith no more options we packed up and moved to Maryland were my older brother got a 100k plus job coding websites. Things were good for a while and with no rush to cover rent or bills I was actually able to grow a small account from 4K to 17k. All good things must come to end sadly. He developed MS because of the stress of losing hundreds of thousands in a few years and his relationship was failing as well. These things affected his ability to learn new programing languages or work efficiently so his job fired him. Then it was up to me to make enough to cover the expenses and slowly I saw the account cannibalized to 0. They blame me almost exclusively for losing all the money by the way.\n\nWe moved back to California being forced to stay within the same apartment complex company because no where else will accept us. Now my brother is suicidal, he\u2019s also diabetic and he\u2019s tried killing himself by overdosing on insulin. His hope is at 0. I\u2019ve matured more than any young adult should have from this ordeal so I feel like I can keep going. But moral is low. My parents work nearly 14 hours a day driving for Uber eats. I can\u2019t really help because I had my ankle fused back in July. My other brother doesn\u2019t live with us anymore because of all the chaos that happened. My parents have real estate licenses and they are trying really hard to find clients. I wish there was more I can do. I learned I should have fought more for our family to continue real estate investing. Nothing made us happier than flipping houses. If I had the opportunity to flip a house I\u2019m sure we could jumpstart that career with my parents\u2019 experience. I\u2019m not against trading even after losing everything, sadly it took that much for me to do it half decently. I\u2019m sticking to vertical spreads on etfs and precious metals, which brings in some profits every few weeks but not enough to make living. Sometimes I\u2019ll use around $50 on near expiration out of the money calls of puts to try to get lucky. Sometimes the temptation to let my whole account ride on naked options is strong. Not because I want to be rich, but because I just want my parents to stop working so hard in something they don\u2019t even enjoy doing at their age. I wanted to share my story because I saw how some of you guys shared similar experiences, and some of you were the exceptions that won in the end. Invest in real estate, it\u2019s profitable if you work with someone who has experience and the market hasn\u2019t tanked. I\u2019m going to Texas in a few days to propose to my girlfriend and bring her back to California. If she says yes it\u2019ll be the highlight of my life.\n\nTLDR; Stocks bad, Real Estate good",

        "selftext": "Yes I know, stonks only go up - etc etc.  However I believe some of you are genuinely in need of some information so let me lay some stuff down for you.   \n\n\n1.) We are at historically elevated valuations.   Somewhere between the Dotcom bubble and Black Tuesday in terms of PE.  Below is a chart of the current Schiller PE levels - this is a popular measure used by value investors such as Warren Buffet.    \n\n\nJust so you know the historical average is somewhere in the 15 to 20 range. I would expect that to creep up due to low interest rates, but we're certainly well past 'safe' levels.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aawxe3mqyva41.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb7c52dc8c3b40ece1d049bc8651de4098c9359b\n\n2.) Speaking of Pappa Buffet - he has been hoarding cash.  Berkshire Hathaway continues to grow its cash pile as there is 'nothing to buy' in this environment.  The chart is a bit old, but last I heard it was somewhere between 100 to 200 billion in cash sitting on the sidelines.  This is on a company with about a 500bil market cap. They would rather just sit on cash than risk getting caught with their pants down.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8osjvrfzva41.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97494980d6151dd9a0358be69ea82d1f35b8c715\n\n3.)  But... companies are crushing it and we live in the greatest economy the world has ever seen don't we???  Actually earnings have been pretty stagnant since 2015.  There are a few companies absolutely crushing it - namely big cap tech, but on average corporate earnings has been mediocre.    \n\n\nP.S - This chart would look a hell of a lot worse if not for stock buybacks.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icdim5uqzva41.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe9043d9eae32d1de5761f783ee5e85224aaa48a\n\n4.) Degenerate investment institutions are levered long and doing dangerous shit like shorting the VIX / running an excessive allocation of derivatives (Looking at you DB).  No one seems willing to admit that this is where the Repo Market money is going, and we can't really get a chart of that capital per-se, but we can find more generic information about margin levels.  \n\n\nSee some of those massive contractions in margin levels?  Generally speaking those aren't from deleveraging - when bubbles burst and portfolio values go down institutions and individuals begin facing margin calls... Forcing more selling, forcing more margin calls etc.  When the market is highly levered it creates a potential for alarmingly rapid draw-downs.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkupn4qt0wa41.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=559530d759fa950be69415a57cf064b65bc5e37c\n\nI won't even go into the details regarding how the global economy is also in shambles and fueled by debt too.  GDP numbers don't account for debt based growth and low interest rates everywhere has caused an explosion of cheap debt. This onion has far more layers than what's described here.  \n\n\nTLDR - We are positioned for a black swan event.  I can't tell you when, but please YOLO responsibly.",

I think they are in for a much deeper recession than that. \n\nResearchers have determined that the coronavirus has R_0 value of 3.8.  This means that for every unquarantined person, it will spread to 3.8 more people. We would need to quarantine 75% of all infected to truly contain it. Some of the local doctors have estimated that there are over 100k infected. \n\nThey are saying that China\u2019s is locking down 150 million people. Can you imagine what that does to productivity to lockdown a population that size? It will have more than a 4% impact on their stock values. \n\nAlso China is retardedly crowded and unhygienic. They don\u2019t even have soap in public bathrooms. This thing will hit hard and hit fast. \n\nHow to play this? I think the best play is to short FXI. You can also go with weekly puts.

        "selftext": "I know a lot of people on here are probably fairly new to trading and therefore this mkt melt up probably makes little to no sense. As a trader for 20 years let me shed a little light on it.  While the fuel for this rally is definitely short covering, the ignition is Trump.  And I mean that quite literally. The Trump administration has a literal buy program in the mkt to drive it higher and create \u201cMarket hits new highs\u201d headlines.  These headlines serve 2 purposes:\n1) In the long run, it will guarantee Trumps re-election.  Trump knows that most view the stock mkt as the ultimate barometer to economic health. Therefore if stocks are at new highs, it means the economy\u2019s doing great, and so is Trump. \n2) In the short run, it overshadows and removes attention from any and all impeachment headlines. The fact is the market will price in any risk of impeachment of Trump especially in light of the fact that there has never been a more pro-stock mkt president in US history.  In other words, if mkt is hitting new highs in the wake of impeachment hearings, then the mkt is basically pricing in a zero percent chance of impeachment and people begin to believe the impeachment hearings are a big waste of time.\n\nWhich brings us to this week.  Watch for Dow to print 30,000 this week as the impeachment trial begins.  Dow 30,000 will be on the front page of every news site, rather than any news from the impeachment hearings. Mission accomplished. \n\nIn other words, do not short stocks at least until you see that Dow 30,000 print. Nasdaq 10,000 is another one you want to watch for. \n\nGood luck all.",

        "selftext": "I've been watching this site for forever and started trading in October with $5,000 and turned it into $40,000 trading earnings and Dis in Nov. It was awesome and I felt badass. \n\nAround Dec 1st I told my gf I would stop trading since I was having sleepless nights, stress headaches, and was somewhat obsessed with this shit. I had to get back in.... and that bad karma made me lose on almost every trade and added $30,000 of real money (to get above $25k) which I lost as well and am down currently $32,000 of real money in additions to all the gains from November. \n\nHere are some highlights: \n\nLulu earnings Dec 11th: I felt it would do well on earnings and lost $22,050 on a $25,000 yolo 10 minutes after purchasing. (My first big guh moment and I f'ing KNEW not to do this) \n\nNVDA Dec 23rd: Bought $25,000 of 1/10 calls that dipped 30 minutes after buying... got weak hands... and lost $13,384. (I bought at the ATH at the time and felt it would just keep going up) \n\nAMD Dec 26th: Bought $15,000 of AMD $50 calls at $47.10 (1/3 and 1/10)... dipped immediately after buying... got weak hands a couple days ago on Dec 30th... and sold around $45.80 for a $11,800 loss. Now I see that fucker is up around $49 today and figured it might since $50 seems doable next week. Fuck me and my shitty decisions... I knew I should have held until today with CES next week but Trump bombing Iraq got me twitchy and I just wanted out. (My $3k would be worth $18k if I would have stayed in one more day) \n\nThe highlight of November was selling my $28k of DIS fd's... 2 hours prior to the stock rocketing up once subscriber numbers were released. I took a $9,000 loss instead of a $150k+ gain. I still got in afterwards and it went up $40k.... which I held until it was a $12k gain and sold. (Selling 368 contracts 2 hours before subscriber numbers came out still makes my heart want to explode) \n\nWell that's my story. Not sure why I am posting but it kinda feels therapeutic in a way to let this shit out. I haven't told anyone since 1. Most my friends wouldn't understand 2. My gf would probably be pissed I lied to her. I have $3,200 left in my restricted from purchasing Robinhood account that I am transferring over to WeBull and the funds should be there in 2 days. I am thinking with earnings this month I can turn this $3,200 around with some smart purchases instead of yolo'ing stupidly. But maybe fucking not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [https://imgur.com/gallery/4kVnfVS](https://imgur.com/gallery/4kVnfVS)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone, I appreciate the welfare checks after TSLA went up today. I had previously only posted about TSLA plays a few times, so it's flattering that you guys associate and know me for TSLA plays. I wasn't going to post this since I'm really embarrassed and ashamed that I let things get out of control. I feel like I let myself and everyone down.\n\nYes, I got screwed very hard. As I have been the past several weeks or so as it has been continuing up. I previously made over $65k at the peak of selling options (both puts and calls) on TSLA in 2019 in just eight or nine months, but that may or may not be gone now with TSLA's surge to the upside.\n\nI fucked up pretty badly and did not manage the trades like I should have. As with a lot of people here, I'm shocked and in disbelief that it hit $498.49. It'll probably break over $500 this week to reach another milestone.\n\nA couple months ago I did talk shit about how TSLA would not get above $400 or even $420 anytime soon. Boy was I dead wrong. You guys are more than welcome to talk shit to me now if you like. I'm happy that a lot of you were able to make massive gains. It did have to come at the expense of people on the other side of the trade.\n\nYou might be wondering if I still have short calls on TSLA. The answer is yes, and I'm not quite sure why. Stubbornness, inability to take a loss at the high even though it keeps making new highs, etc. Basically the opposite of bagholding a long position. Nobody wants to sell for a loss at the bottom similar to not wanting to sell for a loss at the top.\n\nEven the \"no way it will reach this point\" call strikes that I have sold ended up becoming deep in the money. If you'd like to capitalize on this information, some of the \"no way it will reach this point\" strikes that I have are in the $500s.\n\nThe really annoying part is having to pay taxes on gains that may or may not have all been lost and more in the first five trading days of 2020. Even though I did say to myself that I wouldn't sell naked calls as a new year's resolution, I ended up doing so anyways and I paid the consequences.\n\nIf others are in a similar boat after selling calls, I hope you're doing okay and that you didn't put yourself in a really bad situation. Taking a loss is tough. By the time we do, it gets way out of control and ends up being an even bigger one.\n\nDon't worry about me, I'll be fine and will continue trading. My trading confidence took a huge hit and the entire experience has been humbling. This was not how I was hoping 2020 would start. I guess you could let this post/update be a cautionary tale to manage risk better and not take on positions with potentially unlimited risk. More pain will probably come as I still have short calls that I have yet to close.\n\nI do still plan on messing with TSLA once the dust settles from the current positions. Best of luck to everyone out there. Might not post/comment as often since I want to focus on trading and getting on the right track first. Will still answer PMs and mod when I can though. Thank you again for everyone's concerns.",

All it had to do was open slightly green and I was raking in tendies...\n\nBUT THE FIRST DAY I TRY TO DO SOMETHING WE GO TO FUCKING WAR!?!?!  \n\nOf course, I saw the AH rally and futures looking strong, I thought for sure I was gonna kill it tomorrow, but instead, I'm literally gonna lose every penny more than likely...  \n\nThis absolutely floors me though... I didn't touch SPY this entire bull market, not once.  I literally played roku mostly, and some other random stocks, but the first day I buy SPY calls, FD's at that, futures plummet because Orange man decided he wanted to provoke a war overnight instead of just letting me make some money... What a bunch of absolute garbage...\n\nPlease kill me.\n\nEdit:  Like the Autist I am, I doubled down on SPY calls this morning and its recovering!!  Wish me luck lol\n\nEdit2:  Im gay... And single handedly ended the Bull market...  Im sorry.  Im very sorry guys.\n\nEdit3: On the bright side, Cramer said its a bad time to buy so inverse Cramer and I might get lucky lol.  But really.  Cramer, the ultimate hype man extraordinaire turns bearish the day I buy Calls.  Literally insane I actually single handedly ended the bull market and started a war.  \n\nWent from up 25% two days ago to down 60% today. Im optimistic. Afterall, money is just paper anyway.  \n\n Final Edit 4: ok.  So.  Rode some dailies all the way up till just now.  Ended up selling on this spike down because I made like 20-30% and it dropped so I decided to take profits instead of holding while this dumpster fire unfolds.  Currently sitting at about down 40% overall, compared to my 2 days ago up 25-30% so not great, but better than my -60% earlier today.  Not gonna lie.  Its been a wild ride, prolly gonna do it again next week, I havent learned shit.  Im either going broke or gonna be rich.  Prolly broke.  But hey, its just paper anyway.  To the idiot that said \"this is on you for buying at ATH\" Its been at ATH for like 10 years bud.  \n\nFinal edit #2:  its my post, I can make as many edits as I want.  Fuck you.   Im dumbfounded I missed that massive drop right there.  Somehow sold my dailies for a gain and bought puts after to spiked down then back up, I bought puts at that top there.  So gonna ride these puts over the weekend as this dumpster fire political environment unfolds.  I assume theres just gonna be a massive cuckfest about to unfold over the weekend thatll give this atleast 1 more red day.  Who knows.

        "selftext": "I pulled over into a Carl's Jr. in a tiny town on my road trip in the middle of nowhere. I mean the meat isn't bad at all, you can clearly tell it's not real beef because it lacks any beefy flavor and it's a softer texture, but I liked how you could see the grease flow out when you squeeze it, I guess it's from the chunks of vegetable and coconut oil they mix into the soy mix. \n\nBut all the flavor came from the condiments and bread and cheese and grill marks, so it wasn't satisfying at all. I only ate about a third of it and stopped when I looked up the nutritional info and it said there's almost 1,600mg of salt in just the burger, that's fucking insane. Like a McDonald's quarter pounder has one-fourth that much salt. Meanwhile, the Beyond Burger has a similar amount of fat as beef. So you're eating a fuckton more salt and still ingest all that fat compared to the beef patty.\n\nI don't even understand why a vegan would order it, I mean it has cheese and mayo and is cooked on the same grill as the beef, right?

Let me know if you enjoy these types of posts, and I'll come out with more picks in my portfolio!\n\n**Guardant Health (**[**$GH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GH&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)**):**\n\n\"Guardant Health, Inc. is a precision oncology company.

        "selftext": "The outbreak may be more serious than we think. Here's why.\n\n1. \\[Weak - Med Evidence\\] China has a history of covering up bad numbers to try to fix problems and \"face\"\n2. \\[Very Strong Evidence\\] Look up \"Hospital\" in Wuhan. I came up with 18-19 hospitals on Google Maps in just the city center alone, and those are the only ones that are on the map. Looking a bit further, there are many more hospitals on the vicinity of the city center. There may be more. If we take the \"Total Infected\" in China which is reportedly around [1975](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-china-latest-updates/2020/01/26/4603266c-3fa8-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1_story.html), That means on average we're getting around 103 patients per hospital. You're joking right? Here's a [link](http://www.rmhospital.com/896/8963.aspx) to just ONE of the hospitals in Wuhan. For this one singular hospital, the google translate is telling me there are 1,200 beds available. BUT ALL THE HOSPITALS IN WUHAN ARE OVERCAPACITY? The doctors and nurses are all [freaking out](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/etpveg/chinese_doctor_in_the_city_of_wuhan_in_tears/) about how there's no room apparently. So you're telling me one hospital has a 1200 person capacity, its over filled, there are 17-18 more hospitals in the city center, and there are only 1975 people infected? Lol. \n3. \\[Further Strong Evidence\\] Apparently, we don't know if this is true or not, but a nurse/doctor in Wuhan just posted a video claiming 90,000 people are infected. She says there is about a 1:14 ratio where if one person is infected, 14 more will get infected on average. Here's the [video](https://twitter.com/terrence_str/status/1221100970521829377?s=21). 90,000 people would fit the number of hospitals in Wuhan much more. In fact too much. If we're assuming an average 750 bed capacity for all the hospitals in the city center, that would be about 14750 bed capacity for hospitals in the city center. There are other hospitals in the vicinity of the city as well so that would be maybe 3x more if we go on all sides. That's around 50000. She is claiming 90,000 (btw we don't know where she got that number from, but it makes more sense), which is much more than the government reported number, but it make a lot more sense than 1975. \n\nSo basically that's why I think this might be much worse than anticipated. Let me know what you think or if you have further evidence to present.",

        "selftext": "So I just recently started trading options, and like most noob retards I just bought calls and puts because everything else was too confusing and hard.  Credit spreads, iron condors, butterflies?  What the fuck does that mean?  Stock going up= Calls, stock going down= Puts.  I thought that was so simple and easy.  Turns out it was simple and easy except my win percentage was like 20%, and I was losing a bunch of money.  I started to get pissed off, but then I realized that if buying calls and puts only won like 20% of the time, then selling them must win 80% of the time.  So I switched strategies and looked into selling calls/puts.  I learned ( I know learning might be too difficult a concept for some of you retards) that selling calls/puts had a much higher probability of success, but also had basically unlimited loss potential if you're wrong.  Now since I'm a huge pussy and don't like unlimited losses, I learned about credit spreads, which not only have a massively high probability of winning, but also cap your losses at a certain amount.  These things literally CAN'T go tits up.  I'm now trading credit spreads and holy shit these things are literally free money.  Like just pick a number you know the stock isn't going to go past and sell that call/put. Then just buy a call/put and little further out of the money, just in case shit goes bad, and you get to keep all that juicy premium you collected when you sold.  FREE FUCKING MONEY.  Check it out.  AMD is a fucking bull train running harder than the train your friend's ran on your sister last night.  No way that shit drops below $47 again.  Sell the $47 put, buy the $45 because I'm a huge pussy and don't like unlimited losses, and the difference premium is all yours when the options expire, mine are 1/10s.  Free fucking money.  This shit is so easy.  I will trade nothing but credit spreads for the rest of my life.",

        "selftext": "https://www.thedrive.com/news/31761/enormous-costs-of-new-tractors-drive-demand-of-40-year-old-equipment-to-all-time-highs?xid=fbshare\n\nIn this piece by *The Drive*, the author proposes a scenario in which John Deere slowly loses its customer base by creating a technologically advanced product, raising prices to the point that older loyal customers are turning to secondary used markets to fulfill their equipment to needs. \n\nAgriculture has long been an industry participated in by few, but contributes the sustenance of many. Ag has high upside when producers can maximize efficiency, find production equilibrium with supply needs through economies of scale (which allows for fewer producers to need to play and those producers increase the size of their enterprise). But in order to really make economies of scale advantageous, it requires mechanized help. \n\nJohn Deere tractors are your flagship tractor. When you think of tractors, the green with yellow accented behemoths tilling those fields are probably the first that come to mind. But what happens when farmers begin to look at secondary markets to satiate their equipment needs when the producer of their prized equipment no longer is working with their customers to meet their needs? \n\n[Newer models can run upwards of $300,000 for a rig](https://www.fastline.com/farm-equipment-for-sale/listings/john-deere-tractors/results?category=Tractors&amp;manufacturer=John+Deere&amp;minprice=220000&amp;page=1) even on the used market. Why pay $200,000+ for a machine that you could buy for $30,000 thats 40 years old? In fact, farmers are turning to these older machines because they are less complicated to fix. But the demand for those older models are actually driving up the prices in the secondary markets because sellers realize how valuable their old machines are becoming. \n\nJohn Deere tractors are becoming more technologically advanced, but this may not be a good thing. Deere is raising the prices of their machines, and making it such that farmers are looking to used markets to find older machines. If you\u2019ve ever worked on an old car, you can think of it in the same manner\u2014the older tractors are very barebones and mainly mechanical. If you understand how to repair the machine, it\u2019s a fairly straightforward process. \n\nNot only is the upfront cost a factor when it comes to investing in one of these machines, but maintenance repairs is a contributing factor. These newer machines have technological locks built into the operating systems that limit private owners from performing their own repairs on the machine, forcing them to contact the dealership, have them send out a mechanic representative at the dealerships convenience, potentially holding up production for extended periods of time. This puts the farmer\u2019s operations at a reduced level unnecessarily, and at a greater cost, than what they normally would repair themselves.\n\nDue to this, farmers have found an outside solution to this roadblock Deere corporate has put in place to lock the technology systems of the machines: [Ukrainian software hacks.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware). [October of 2016, buyers were required to sign a licensing agreement forbidding the repair and modification of farming equipment.](https://www.deere.com/privacy_and_data/docs/agreement_pdfs/english/2016-10-28-Embedded-Software-EULA.pdf)\n\nIs John Deere alienating one of its leading sales segments? With international trade agreements being formed, amended and expanded\u2014soybean, grain and corn is going to be in great demand. Farmers are going to need equipment that fulfills their operations, small or large scale. These new equipment prices, in addition to prices to maintain the machines, are going to be passed onto consumers, ultimately driving up prices for some of our most common goods. Why pay more than you have to for a machine today when one three decades old can be refurbished and folded into operation for significantly less cost? \n\nAccording to their financial statements, FY 2019 revenue was the first year since FY 2014 that it was greater. Bringing in $39.26B in 2019, 8.9% greater than the second highest year this decade in FY 2014 at $36.02B. $DE\u2019s brought in a net profit of $3.25B in FY 2019, up 2.8% from FY 2014. FY 2015-2018 all showed negative growth from the peak in 2014 if omitting 2019 data. \n\nWith John Deere and Caterpillar ($CAT) being some of the leading manufacturing segments in the United States, is manufacturing at risk if $DE doesn\u2019t change their business model to be more accommodating to their customers? $DE and $CAT are both major construction equipment manufacturers, with Caterpillar leading over Deere in that segment.\n\nFrom John Deere\u2019s financial statements, they revenued $20,511B in Ag sales (84% of total sales), compared to construction at $3,831B (16% of their equipment sales). So clearly, their ag customers will have significant leverage if a portion of them begin to look in the secondary markets for used equipment they can fix themselves, or even if they purchase new equipment, but use this Ukrainian hack to crack the operating systems of their machines and fix it themselves. \n\nWith agriculture being Deere\u2019s most prominent segment, if they don\u2019t begin to accommodate their farmer customers more carefully, $DE could begin to face sales pressures in the next coming years. The commodities will be needed to be farmed with or without Deere, so will they bend the knee? Or continue in an adverse customer-producer relationship that ultimately may hurt the company. If Deere doesn\u2019t change their business model, they may eventually price themselves out of the market.\n\nTL; DR: if John Deere doesn\u2019t start making efforts to work with the customers as opposed to trying to squeeze every penny out of them.",

        "selftext": "Freshly graduated out of college, I had the genius idea that I would invest in the stock market. It was all great and fun at first with the stock market being relatively cheap to invest in. Companies weren't all too developed. So I had a good time and gained about 8% on my 4k investment. Doesn't sound a lot, but 4k goes a long way for a fresh graduate. Fast forward 4 months, I saw people making big plays on options. So of course, the typical RH user in me checked off the list for options and dived in. I remember going for Canada Goose calls, went way OTM when I didn't even know what OTM was. What do you know? The stock jumps 5% the next day and I caught a sweet 2k return. I was hooked. \n\nThe option game went well for only about two weeks until I ran into my first big loss. I forget exactly what it was, but it took a fat dump on me. Lost 2.5k. So I went back in, full steam and went for ATM calls. This time around I was a bit more experienced, but luck was not on my side. Lost another 2.5k. At this point, I was still positive. Long story short, by year's end, I was down 5k. Fast forward another year, I was down 15k. I took a year break and got back on my feet. Still, lost another 5k that year even safely trading a combination of stocks and options. Stocks did well, options fell through the rood for me. So, I'm at -25k at this point. I've got about 3k left and I FINALLY came to the realization that I have a gambling problem. If you aren't into trading options, and especially day trading them, **don't fucking do it.** For me, I didn't lose a life threatening amount of money, but it is a whole lot of money. \n\nWith the remaining 3k, I'm going to offset some risk with some SP500 stocks and only play 1-2 month out options with only a max of 1-2 contracts per buy. If you're hard headed and still want to dive into options (if you haven't already started), be smart. Don't go OTM. Pay the bigger premium, take the smaller gains and learn when to cut the losses. Be disciplined by friends. Hopefully, I can tell a better story - a comeback story if you will. \n\nHappy to listen to others that are in deep shit like myself.",

This is called Cybercar in the model\n* Autonomous vehicle revenue will begin to kick in around the year 2025\n* By 2028, roughly 33% of Tesla's new fleet sales (7.6 * .33 = 2.3m) will be generating some level of revenue for the company as autonomous revenue. For this model I'm assuming $7.3k of sales from autonomous per unit on average at 80% margin\n* I'm assuming roughly 1% dilution YoY\n* I'm assuming ~300k Tesla operated RoboTaxis manufactured yearly by Tesla to cover gaps in coverage in the self driving network\n* I'm assuming Tesla Energy to grow to generate similar levels of sales from the Energy business by 2028 as compared to Auto\n* i'm assuming a total operating income % of sales of 17.3% on $508b of revenue by 2028\n* I'm assuming a 38 P/E multiple on $87b of yearly earnings by 2028\n\nThat covers all the big picture stuff as it pertains to what the model takes into account.\n\nThe price is obviously eye popping and would give Tesla a market cap of ~3.5 trillion. However, the way I think about this company is drawing a parallel to Apple, which is a Hardware company that has a SaaS (Software as a Service) component bolted on top of it selling units that generate vastly more $ per unit sold, and is entering an entirely disrupted market in the last 100 years that is about as large as it gets on the auto side - and then you add energy on top of it.\n\nLet me know your thoughts.",

        "selftext": "This one is probably long coming but these posts add absolutely nothing to the investment discussion.  They're simply bait for people to express their political views under the veil of markets.  Without fail every time we have one of these threads someone gets banned for political attacks and the whole thing gets shut down.  \n\nObviously policy impacts markets, and we have to be appreciative of people's differing (civil and thoughtful)views on policy so topics concerning specific policy initiatives will still be allowed but they must be clearly and obviously tied to investing.  The policy must also be flushed out and have a reasonable chance of becoming law.  This means \"what happens to markets if we get universal Healthcare\" or \"what would a wealth tax do\" isn't acceptable.  You would need to have something more specific such as \"what is the risk to insurance stocks under proposed law XYZ\".  Basically all of this comes down to effort: if the question looks like a low effort fishing expedition for a political argument it'll be taken as such.  If OP displays a specific understanding of the topic and displays effort to directly relate to investing then that should absolutely be allowed. \n\nUnder these guidelines policy proposals from candidates are going to come under extra scrutiny.  In the financial world we are concerned with probabilities and within that context proposals that are unlikely to ever make it beyond campaign speeches are going to be pretty heavily restricted.  What I mean by that is if Sanders or Warren mention a wealth tax \"what happens if we get a wealth tax\" isn't a thread that needs to happen here.  I think we're all willing to be flexible on topics here but the further away something is from reality the less it needs to be a topic here.  \n\nHere's an example: Last month the Secure Act made it's way in to a budget bill.  This is the largest change to retirement plan rules since the pension protection act of 06.  There were two threads on this topic with aggregate upvotes of less than 10.  Any given low effort question concerning a current candidate makes it to the front page in minutes.  I'll be honest, I feel like we as mods have not done a good job when real world policy that impacts everyone is not a hot topic here but hypothesizing how legislation that doesn't exist is.  So with that context in mind we're going to be taking the aforementioned steps to remove some of the threads that are thinly veiled attempts to talk general politics.\n\nThat said, one further clarification: this does not extend to any sort of research, white papers, etc concerning said policy and markets.  Goldman publishes their thoughts on how universal health care would impact different sectors?  Absolutely post it up.  A study of equity performance under new taxation in other countries?  Go for it.  You want to ask what happens to stocks if the US has a communist revolution?  Kindly do so in /r/politics. \n\n\nthe rules on the sidebar will be adjusted to reflect this shortly.  Feel free to provide feedback on specifics here, we're pretty set on the general direction but always open to subscriber feedback. \n\nAlso one last note: we need to expand the mod team, we're all busy and there's a consistently increasing amount of rule breaking behavior.  In the past we've done so organically by selecting regulars with good history of contributing to be mods.  That will probably hold true going forward as well - IMO appointing mods that aren't longstanding contributors is how you end up with subs like /r/economics.  So if you're interested throw your name in the hat, I can't promise anything and if we don't recognize your username it's highly unlikely you'd be selected but I'd like to cast a line and see what hits.\n\nThanks.",

        "selftext": "25 and just had a quarter life crisis and thought about retirement for the first time ever. Just opened a Roth IRA, looking to get the most bang for my buck for the next 25+ years with this account. \n\nI have two simple strategies I am considering employing. I'm thinking about either investing only in one mutual fund and/or total market ETF and 1-3 individual stocks that would only make up 10-20% of my portfolio(V, MSFT and AAPL most likely). My other strategy would be investing in 10-20 blue chip stocks with with high revenue, low debt and decent dividend payouts (WFC, MO, CCI for example). What strategy is best for very long term growth? \n\nIn regards to the first strategy, if I'm going very long in a Roth IRA wouldnt a mutual fund be better than an ETF? Should I do one or both?\n\nIn regards to the second strategy, since Roth IRA isnt taxed, does it make more sense to go after blue chip dividend stocks or growth stocks?\n\nThanks in advance!",

They had no capital in their business. The story was that they had no profits (I question that now) but they had no capital in their business for a long time. Invested capital was negative for a long time until 2012 when they got into the cloud systems they're known for (and AWS is the massive cash flow machine it is). Chanos pointed this out in a fireside chat he had with Dan Gilbert (which ultimately created my interest in looking into the statements now). \"The money followed the investment\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nII. They only had two years where they were shrinking more than they were growing (I see this as Capex&lt;D&amp;A) and those two years were 2007 and 2009. They shrank by a very small amount. No business grows continually forever so this comes as no surprise. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIII. For the years chosen here they were free cash flow positive, net revenue positive, and EBITDA positive. They had negative net income in 2014. An amazing run. Consistent gross margins also with very little fluctuation. They had negative book value in 2004. Their return on net tangible equity also was fantastic with one negative year in 2004.",

I just saw a new mark wahlburg movie trailer and thought wow, Netflix is getting into that position where they can just buy anything they want, and movie makers will go for it because everyone\u2019s watching Netflix.\n\nDisney and Apple on the other hand have to stick to their guns, especially Disney. There\u2019s a look, a feel, a branded image that comes along with these two giants - youll never see Disney put out a horror movie or a movie with raunchy sex scenes.

I didn't know this sub existed or i would of came here first.\n\nMy brother recently started a new job at the local pizza place and the owner has been talking up the dinar to him for a while. Apparently the owner has at least 10k in dinar and most likely more. My brother recently bought about $800 worth of dinar and wants to get more. My worries are that my brothers boss is hyping up the dinar and my brother is getting bad info from him and letting that cloud his judgement. \n\nIm not an investor and when i tried to do some research into this i felt like i was just spinning wheels. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/i/iqd-iraqi-dinar.asp was the best article i could find. I can safely say that however he's getting the dinar is legit and he's not getting scammed that way. I've read a few articles that claim dinar investors are \"just dumb trump supporters\" buying into a scheme. Other articles are by \"Dinarians\" who've been waiting over a decade for something that's coming any day now. \n\nAccording to the article people are confusing re-denomination with reevaluation and that if Iraq re-denominates then any investment will basically be worthless. I've read some claims from people and my brother has said that if they do re-denominate that they will still come out ahead. Is that possible? How does that work?\n\nIs my brother wasting his money? I cant and wont fault him for taking a gamble on something that could pan out in the future even if it turns out to be a huge loss but if he's going on bad information from his boss (a pizza maker not an investor) who's over-hyping this dinar scheme i wanna stop him before he gets anymore.",

If you're bullish on the S&amp;P 500/DOW, you can be bullish on Microsoft - and expect it to outperform.

The correction in gold is over and we are well on our way into the new bull market.

We\u2019re well into QE 4, it\u2019s laughable that the fed won\u2019t call it that; but if they did they would be admitting to debt monetization.

Scumbags would rather see the stock market up in nominal terms, than actually do their jobs and not get involved. \n\nWe\u2019re headed right into a currency crisis. Surprisingly gold has gone up before the drop in the dollar has even started; shows just how weak the dollar is, and how the risk premiums are starting to be built in. \n\nNow I don\u2019t expect the public/general investors to hop into gold until it is well over $2000 an oz. Increasing demand has come from central banks globally, they\u2019ve been buying large amounts of gold and selling off US treasuries.

It\u2019s currently out of control, and they estimate ~3,000 cars can go lost. Unsubstantiated rumors suggest it was an electric vehicle catching fire that started it, and with Tesla being a disproportionate amount of the EVs sold here, there\u2019s a significant possibility it was one of their cars.

        "selftext": "**Alright so we have 3 main objectives here:**\n\n1. Establish A Tax Haven in Detroit\n2. Make Tendies when the Cheap real estate goes up as we buy it\n3. Run the City?\n\nAlright, so let's start with the first one.\n\nElections for local officials are in November, so we must get registered there before then. Detroit has around  479,267  registered voters. Meaning it only takes just above half that to infiltrate the city offices. If we abuse the gerrymandered counties we could do it with even less. Now let's look at offices, we can ignore all senate and house positions which leaves us with the Mayor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State. Once we hold these positions we expand programs helping us and boosting investment from outside who in turn ensure our re-election.\n\nNext, we have to buy cheap real estate.\n\n   As another user pointed out we can buy real estate at  [https://buildingdetroit.org/](https://buildingdetroit.org/) . But as others pointed out people could move in an cause many liabilities. To circumvent this we must become the ruling gang. If all of us arm then we can become the main gang running the city from the government from the offices and streets. Via transferring all your assets to a hospitality company whose sole customer is you we can qualify for property tax exemption as seen here. [https://detroitmi.gov/government/boards/property-assessment-board-review/homeowners-property-tax-assistance-program-hptap](https://detroitmi.gov/government/boards/property-assessment-board-review/homeowners-property-tax-assistance-program-hptap). This surge in investment, as well as the renovations for even more tax exemptions prices for real estate, will go up as long as enough of us do it.\n\nFinally, We will have taken over Detroit we now have to figure out what to do here. Any suggestions? Also because several things I mentioned are illegal I would like to tell the SEC, FBI, NSA, that all of this is an exaggerated theoretical joke and I am not responsible for the actions of those who cannot differentiate a joke from reality.",

        "selftext": "[From the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/business/electric-cars-germany-economy.html)\n\nGermany relies heavily on internal combustion engine cars for its economy.\n\nThree of the top 5 companies in Germany are (primarily gas) automakers.\n\nWhile USA auto-maker Tesla started out with electric, we can see from unionized ICE auto-makers in the US, [slowing the transition to electric cars](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gms-electric-ambitions-rattle-below-the-surface-of-the-uaw-strike-11569582003) is a major priority of unions.  Simply put to be competitive in the electric car market it requires a lot less workers and lower wages. Electric cars are just simpler mechanically and require less work to build.\n\nHistorically Germany's unions have been adept at reading market conditions and working to create competitive vehicles rather than just maximize wages.\n\nWill union pressure prevent German automakers from competing with companies like Tesla, Rivian, or asian startups?\n\nWill pivoting from gas to electric be an easy task for them even if we take away the pressure of unions?",

        "selftext": "I know its a meme stock... But, look at that short interest...\n\nThis thing has 60% short interest, I have literally never seen something so likely to go tits up in my life.  On monday I will be opening a position in this stock for after earnings for a couple reasons.  \n\n1.  I exercise a good amount and literally cannot escape Peloton ads.  They are everywhere I go from my gym, around my gym, on pandora all the time, youtube, reddit, literally everywhere.  I have never even googled their products or anything.  At most I may have googled their stock ticker once or twice, but I get tons of ads from supplement places and stuff like that, but Peloton is by far the biggest one.  \n\nTldr: they are dumping money into advertising, especially for the christmas season\n\nAlso, someone on here posted that his Peloton system was down from server overloads, aka, literally too many people are using it and overloading their system.  This means they sold significantly more than they anticipated as well.  \n\nPlus they have a solid business model with selling equipment and subscriptions.  \n\nIm going be buying calls for Feb 21 48.00 calls.  Long term bearish honestly, but this seems like free money imo",

        "selftext": "This is a list of likely scenarios I've compiled and am picking through to find specific companies, ETFs, and etc. to bet on. Iran has never waited too long to respond, because the regime is insecure with their   \u0642\u0636\u064a\u0628 (qadib) size.\n\n1. Boat seizures in Gulf, everyone knows they'll do it. Shipping is going to slow to a crawl there for a minute especially for companies which got their shit jacked before. Iran friendly shippers or ones good with bribes will have a splendid year.

Cyber attack, long cyber sec., short attractive targets.  Invest in Clinton's hackerproof servers.\n3. Oil fires, they will burn like the infidels, Iran can't project conventional force worth a shit. So easy targets are near by.\n4. Keep an eye on Russkies, North Korea, and Syria.\n\nEdit:\n\n5.     Military doesn't build bases or provide logistics in places like Kuwait or  Ali Al Salem, contractors do. $KBR used to be huge, but  there are others [https://www.militaryhire.com/overseas-contracting-jobs/country/Kuwait/](https://www.militaryhire.com/overseas-contracting-jobs/country/Kuwait/) and similar sites paint a picture of who does what. Its safe to assume  a troop surge and an increase in revenue for contracting companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone bitching about this post being too serious, remember... YOU NEVER GO FULL RETARD",
