It's been a decade since the last upgrade of wireless download speeds, which suggests that consumers and businesses will be jumping at the prospect of updating their wireless devices. Since AT&amp;T generates its juiciest margins from wireless data, an increase in download speeds can only improve its operating margins.\n\n\nAT&amp;T also stands to benefit from its push into streaming. Despite a slow start to the launch of HBO Max in late May, AT&amp;T's subscriber numbers have picked up significantly in recent months. This may have to do with subsidiary WarnerMedia releasing all of its movies in 2021 on HBO Max the same day they'll hit theaters.",

        "selftext": "Posted by Nova &amp; Carob \n\nTo be clear from the inception of this DD, the purpose here is to shine a light on Hedge Funds and companies that are shorting AMC/GME and/or buying puts against AMC/GME. This light comes from a private community of Apes that have been looking very closely into the activities and inner workings of Citadel and friends. Our community intends to be as transparent as possible with everyape in our family, so we have made a unanimous decision to come forward here in this DD to all of you. We have coined the name The ApesOnWallStreet and before getting into the really good stuff we, Nova and Carob, want to personally provide some information about the Apes in our community. \n\nAnd a small message from Carob; I\u2019m good apes, thank you for your support, hope you enjoy reading our findings.\n\n**The ApesOnWallStreet** \n\n* We are a group of a few Apes that have been talking behind the scenes and merging the few wrinkles on our brains to form one very, very wrinkly Ape mind. The present goal is to create, review, and assist with DD\u2019s to help the Ape community grow in knowledge!\n* I personally am extremely grateful for this opportunity to be a voice against the players trying to manipulate the system. I speak for all of us when I say how grateful we are, to all of you who read our DD\u2019s and for all of your support. Every message, every upvote, every sentiment of encouragement expressed just reinforces our dedication to all of you and our drive to learn &amp; uncover more. \n\nI, Nova, The Student of Psychology, have nothing but the utmost love for every single ape, for all the huddled masses and for everyone struggling in this extremely complicated world of ours.\n\nWe were brought together by Moczak9, who read all of our DD\u2019s and reached out to all of us to bring us together in the belief that we could be a stronger force united. So far, I think he was right. I personally, am extremely grateful to him for this opportunity to be a powerful weapon against a very devious enemy. I personally never imagined that I would ever be part of something like this and now, honestly, I can\u2019t imagine a world without all of you. \n\n# Reddit Usernames ;\n\nu/TheNovaeterrae \n\nu/moczak9 (Founder) \n\nu/-Amewthyst- \n\nu/FuckYouWithAloha \n\nu/umu68 \n\nu/autistic-lord \n\nu/Horror_Carob2817 \n\nu/GGGGG\n\n**Now, let\u2019s get to the juicy part**. You all know I, Nova, love my links and this DD will be full of them. We will only include information that is readily accessible to everyape. No speculation. No opinions. I may include a small motivational speech because I have a need to add at least a dash of emotion into everything I do. It\u2019s my empathy that gives me my greatest strengths as a human being and I am so much less than I am, without that. But most of this will be facts. And links. And pictures. From the links. I hope this helps. \n\n# PART A. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN VIJAYABALAN MURUGESU OR (BALAN FOR THOSE WHO CAN\u2019T PRONOUNCE HIS NAME) AND CITADEL;\n\nNow, most of you might be wondering who is Balan? He isn\u2019t mentioned anywhere on any other DD or anything we\u2019ve seen that has to do with AMC, GME or Citadel. Well, hold onto your seats. \n\nThis is Balan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rkar9fxiekt61.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77cbe0cd31beea4e14b20e00da9016ddb67e5670\n\nLink: Where we found his face. \n\n[https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2005/06/12/global-malaysians-network-spreading-afar](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2005/06/12/global-malaysians-network-spreading-afar)\n\nIf we start pulling the thread on Balan, you may first encounter Offshoreleaks. On offshore leaks you\u2019ll find 3 entities, all of which are named Redmile. I included a picture below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhz7tlyjekt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ed5b9e1afcbdd864c7c80a35c67cb621923edbc\n\nIf you then search for Redmile, you may encounter the following SEC Report. \n\n( Link: [https://sec.report/Document/0001472225-13-000001/](https://sec.report/Document/0001472225-13-000001/) )\n\nHere I want to show you the Form D/A Redmile Strategic Offshore Fund, Ltd D/A \\[Amend\\] - Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities. This was published January 25th, 2013 at 17:42:45. It was submitted on January 28th, 2013. The filing agent is RedMile Ventures, LTD. Now upon opening this SEC Report, the first message you will see is that \u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission has not necessarily reviewed the information in this filing and has not determined if it is accurate and complete. The reader should not assume that the information is accurate and complete.\u201d \n\nMake of that what you will. \n\nThe jurisdiction here is the Cayman Islands. You\u2019ll see this location quite a few times as you look into Redmile. The reason being, is that the Cayman Islands are Balan\u2019s and Ken\u2019s wet dream palace. Gross, I know. And sorry, that is an opinion, someone might be into that, who knows? Anyway, the Cayman Islands is well known as one of the best tax havens of the world. According to Claire Boyte-White\u2019s article, titled \u201cWhy Are the Cayman Islands Considered a Tax Haven\u201d on Investopedia; \u201cUnlike most countries, the Caymans don\u2019t have a corporate tax which is a tax on the profits of a corporation\u201d. This makes it an incredible place for multinational corporations to base subsidiary entities which then act as shields to some or ALL of their incomes from taxation. I\u2019ve included a link below so you can read all about it. \n\n( Link: [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100215/why-cayman-islands-considered-tax-haven.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100215/why-cayman-islands-considered-tax-haven.asp) )\n\nNow as you look into Redmile eventually you\u2019ll also notice the name of Jeremy Green. He is noted as the executive officer of Redmile Group, LLC, the Investment Manager of the Issuer. Here\u2019s his face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5a82pqfvekt61.png?width=263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bebc908a5ee50d57fd667471ac00c5842ce809f1\n\nLink: As a favor to you all, we will not lead you to where we found his face. You\u2019ve seen enough. \n\nNow according to Fintel, \u201cRedmile Group, LLC has disclosed 87 total holdings in their latest SEC filings. \n\nMost recent portfolio value is calculated to be $ 8,258,586,000 USD.\u201d \n\nThis Fintel link has more information here about actual assets under management and so on -&gt; [https://fintel.io/i/redmile-group-llc](https://fintel.io/i/redmile-group-llc) \n\nBut they only matter to me for one peculiar reason.

I know you don\u2019t want to do all that so I\u2019ll make life easier for you and all of the Apes watching your video because I love all of you so much (there go those freaking emotions again). In the link you will find \u201cAdditional Series B investors included *Westlake Village BioPartners*, Kleiner Perkins, Cowen Healthcare Investments, *Acorn Bioventures,* HBM Partners, Perceptive Advisors, and **Surveyor Capital (a Citadel company)**\u201d. \n\nKen\u2019s Stupid Face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img mtkpn1kwekt61...*\n\n**Redmile Special Opportunities Fund LTD** \n\nIn between the years of 2019-2021 - Redmile profits skyrocketed.

If you are still confused, here is a graph to display this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9obd70qxekt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e0e042b6cbc0a44704cd4c9a48fceaa3389d312\n\nThe graph can be found on this link that was provided to us by our very own, Lisbeth Salander AKA Amewthyst - &gt; [https://aum13f.com/fund/redmile-special-opportunities-fund-ltd](https://aum13f.com/fund/redmile-special-opportunities-fund-ltd)\n\nAs an added tidbit, Custodians listed under Fund Details include the following\u2026 \n\nThe Northern Trust International Banking Corporation, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co LLC, Morgan Stanley Institutional Liquidity Funds c/o Morgan Stanley Services Company Inc, JP Morgan Clearing Corp, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley Private Bank National Association. \n\n# PART B. Balan and his HedgeFund friends;\n\nLet\u2019s face it, what would a world be for Balan if he only had one HedgeFund friend? That\u2019d probably be so empty, so lonely. That cannot be. Balan and Ken need friends. So we are going to dive into what Hedge Funds Balan is actually connected to, and it is a ton, probably even more than we were able to find. \n\n*Broad peak fund II LTD.;* \n\nA Singapore based company named Broad Peak Fund is connected to Balan, in the Caymans and others from there. ( Link: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743736/000174373619000002/xslFormDX01/primary\\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743736/000174373619000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml) ). This company is based in several locations, the locations being; Singapore, Oregon and the Grand Cayman. A man named Syed Hyder Ahmad ( we will call him SHA for short ) is also connected to this company through the SingaPore based firm. Now you may ask who this is man? Well, this man is the founder of this company, Broad Peak Fund, but he founded it after he had resigned from his post from another well known company you might possibly recognize, ***Goldman Sachs***. He was the Co-Head of securities for Asia, after he resigned from his position he went on and started Broad Peak Investments, and of course, as we all could\u2019ve guessed, Goldman Sachs is also on the list of custodians. \n\n[https://www.globalcustodian.com/goldman-sachs-director-resigns-to-reportedly-start-his-own-asian-hedge-fund/](https://www.globalcustodian.com/goldman-sachs-director-resigns-to-reportedly-start-his-own-asian-hedge-fund/)\n\n*Pura Vida Investments LLC;*\n\nPura Vida being the name of the onshore company based in the US, they have an offshore fund that is called Pura Vida Offshore fund ONE, get it? The ONE because there are multiple -\\_-  Just like the other funds that Balan is connected to, this offshore fund is also based in the Caymans. The offshore funds are runned by; Ballan, Martin Laidlaw and Philip Hughes. We will call them the *Trio of Trouble* from now on. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll love that. \n\n1: [https://sec.report/CIK/0001637529](https://sec.report/CIK/0001637529) 2: [https://sec.report/CIK/0001774263](https://sec.report/CIK/0001774263) \n\n*140Summer partners LP;*\n\nAnd yet again another US based Hedge Fund that is associated with Balan! They own 3 onshore funds under the name 140 Summer Partners Onshore, 140 Summer Partners LP and 140 Summer Partners Fund GP LLC. For these 3 onshore funds they also own 2 offshore funds under the names; 140 Summer Partners Offshore LTD and Summer Partners Master fund. The Offshore funds have only posted a Securities offering once, now this isn\u2019t something to worry about since they have been in business for only a year. The company has a total of assets under management (AUM) of around $2.6 Billion in their first year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wlnbsy50fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=447ac94fe0ab60d1c520f7cea205c894e3d5ce3d\n\nYou see that perfectly normal rising line in every single chart? Yeah we do as well, this isn\u2019t normal stuff unless some bigger company decided to invest in them and gave them a boat load of money.\n\nConveniently enough they have sold the biggest amount of their assets through the fund in the Caymans. The onshore fund sold assets as well, but it was 30% less than what we are seeing in the Caymans.The only thing that the Fund in the Caymans has done is sell their securities, nothing else has been reported from there, *how convenient.*  [https://sec.report/CIK/0001813446](https://sec.report/CIK/0001813446) \n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9l0nmab1fkt61.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b7245f0a82b5b02da9e1ac29021fe7a6a0101b\n\n*Pharo Trading Fund;*\n\nLast but not least for now is *Pharo trading fund*, this is a big company all around the world. So why did this spark our interest? It\u2019s not obviously not because Balan is on there because he obviously is. But the fact that the Pharo Trading Fund, LTD. based in the Caymans has only sold stock, for multiple years, I repeat, they have only sold stock but have never bought any ( At least not by filing them ). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39hpkr72fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c27defb5190296925c8e22476da57b4404e29c\n\nEvery single year they have offered securities/stock around the same time, the only year that stands out to us is the year of 2020 where they were 2 Months late when they previously never were. All of the directors got paid a nice bonus of $10k per person every single year for filing these reports.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gv6w8l3fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b5dfc441a448cc53b30d981c4ca1374d04e6edc\n\nOur man Balan is on the board of directors for this company as well as; David Bree and Peter Rioda. Let\u2019s say that our man Balan has made a nice profit from only this company alone (around $100k), very lucrative business as you may see, and this is just one of the examples of many. \n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001085146-19-001050/](https://sec.report/Document/0001085146-19-001050/) \n\n# Part C. THE ENEMY \n\nApes have really only been seriously fighting amongst each other on one thing. GME vs AMC. The great divide. The only thing that has seemingly separated apes is the fact that there are 2 stocks with incredible squeeze potential and because most of us are nerds, we believe that there can only be one. One stock to rule them all, one stock to find them, one stock to bring them all and...okay I\u2019ll stop, I\u2019ll stop\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6h961z4fkt61.png?width=133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfb3a9a75b2c9e05f620ed4efbab6ceb2507f058\n\nAND IN THE DARKNESS BIND THEM! I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t stop. You know that! You know that. But, I digress. Either way, you get it. Well, well, well, how we were all oh so wrong. Because the fact that there are 2 is exactly how we find the enemy. See the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And in this case, the enemy of AMC is also the enemy of GME. If you aren\u2019t following me here, I\u2019m saying that's the connection. These 2 stocks move together like a dance.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vbrofu5fkt61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b32ff1532c51491528cebd3aa128e3c3a6ebec1b\n\nSo stands to reason...that they share common enemies. Now, we\u2019re not going to completely release all their dirty secrets on this one DD but I have a feeling they\u2019re going to come across this. I just got a feeling. \n\nAnd I\u2019m curious how much of them are going to enjoy all the attention they have coming their way in future DD\u2019s. Here are a few of the names of companies that are interested in what AMC and GME are both doing as of late. \n\nMake of it what you will. \n\n[ADVISORNET FINANCIAL, INC](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/advisornet-financial-inc)**(PUT)** \n\n[SUSQUEHANNA INTERNATIONAL GROUP, LLP](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/susquehanna-international-group-llp)**(PUT) &amp; (CALL)**\n\n[**PRIVATE CAPITAL GROUP, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/private-capital-group-llc) **&amp;** [**PRIVATE ADVISOR GROUP, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/private-advisor-group-llc) **(PUT) &amp; (CALL)**\n\n[**FLAGSHIP PRIVATE WEALTH, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/flagship-private-wealth-llc)\n\n[**EVERENCE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT INC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/menno-insurance-service-inc-dba-mma-capital-management)**(?)**\n\n[**DIMENSIONAL FUND ADVISORS LP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/dimensional-fund-advisors-inc)**(?)**\n\n[**HUDSON BAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/hudson-bay-capital-management-l-p)**(?)**\n\n[**UBS ASSET MANAGEMENT AMERICAS INC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ubs-global-asset-management-americas-inc)**(?)**\n\n[**HSBC HOLDINGS PLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/hsbc-holdings-plc)**(?)**\n\n[**SCHRODER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT GROUP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/schroder-investment-management-group)**(?)**\n\n[**ALYESKA INVESTMENT GROUP, L.P.**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/alyeska-investment-group-l-p)**(?)**\n\n[**PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL GROUP INC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/principal-financial-group-inc)\n\n[**SCULPTOR CAPITAL LP**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/oz-management-lp)**(PUT)&amp;(CALL)**\n\n[**JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; COMPANY**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/j-p-morgan-chase-co)**(D) ALL OF THE ABOVE**\n\n[**UBS OCONNOR LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ubs-oconnor-llc)**(PUT)**\n\n[**IMC-CHICAGO, LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/imc-chicago-llc)**(PUT)&amp;(CALL)**\n\n[**CITADEL ADVISORS LLC**](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc)**(D) ALL OF THE ABOVE**\n\n**(WILL ORGANIZE BETTER LATER WITH** **MUCH** **MORE DETAIL)**\n\nSo that\u2019s it. It\u2019s just these companies. Just 18. That seems like more than enough friends right? No. Not enough. So let\u2019s find more of Ken\u2019s friends, we want to really set up that playhouse. \n\n### Antara Capital LP ownership in CLVS / Clovis Oncology Inc\n\n2019-11-14 - Antara Capital LP has filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of 0 shares of Clovis Oncology Inc (US:CLVS) with total holdings valued at $0 USD as of 2019-09-30. Antara Capital LP had filed a previous 13F-HR on 2019-08-14 disclosing 50,000 shares of Clovis Oncology Inc at a value of $743,000 USD. This represents a change in shares of -100.00 percent and a change in value of -100.00 percent during the quarter.\n\nAntara Capital LP has a history of taking positions in derivatives of the underlying security (CLVS) in the form of stock options. The firm currently holds 0 call options valued at $0 USD and 42,500 put options valued at $204,000 USD .\n\nOther investors with closed positions include [Canada Pension Plan Investment Board](https://fintel.io/so/us/clvs/canada-pension-plan-investment-board), [Soros Fund Management Llc](https://fintel.io/so/us/clvs/soros-fund-management-llc), [**Citadel Advisors Llc**](https://fintel.io/so/us/clvs/citadel-advisors-llc)**,** [**Invesco Ltd.**](https://fintel.io/so/us/clvs/invesco)**, and** [**Redmile Group, LLC**](https://fintel.io/so/us/clvs/redmile-group-llc)**.**\n\nA substantial portion of the Company\u2019s options, clearing and financing activities are with a **Bank of America Merrill Lynch subsidiary (\u201cBAML\u201d).** These positions are recorded at fair value under securities owned on the statement of financial condition. This results in a concentration of operational and credit risks with BAML. Such risk, however, is partially mitigated by the obligation of certain of these financial institutions to maintain minimum net capital and to segregate customers\u2019 funds and financial instruments from the financial institution\u2019s own holdings. \n\n**Merrill Lynch. That\u2019s it. Just Merrill Lynch.**  \n\n**And for the internet's sake, Wikipedia.** \n\n* [***The Quants: How a New Breed of Math Whizzes Conquered Wall Street and Nearly Destroyed It***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quants)\n* [***Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v.

But know that we fully intend to dive further, in multiple DD\u2019s with each one going really in depth into who runs these companies, how they run their companies, and just doing our part to make sure that everything is being done above board. Just, you know, to help out the SEC because they are just so busy these days, having to read and everything. Y\u2019know that\u2019s pretty new for them so we really just want to help out and we are very ready to take on these responsibilities. But, all jokes aside, does anyone reading this know what the best part of this is? \n\nWe don\u2019t even want a paycheck. We\u2019re not charging anyone, for any of this. Wouldn\u2019t take it. Because even though we live in a Capitalist Society that serves as a breeding ground for corruption, I personally, prefer to look at it as a test of human virtue. Will a person try to create something that helps humanity regardless of how much they make? Will a person deny a Million dollars so his employees can all get better pay? Will a person hoard all the money they can while others struggle? Will a person choose the easy way to live, or the hard way? The moral way. In service of others. I personally think corruption has an expiration date. Maybe. I sure hope so. \n\nAlright, speech over. More links below. Links on links on links. And pictures. These links include compelling information about what has been said in this DD and maybe a bit more. Sorry Andrew, but we think these links speak very loudly enough for themselves. Thank you all for taking the time to read this.

Honest workers, Citadel doesn\u2019t care;\n\nSo you are an ape that has worked their entire life from 9 to 5, you have earned some good pension by now right? Well you do, but Citadel and other funds DO NOT care about that, by investing with brokers from the Caymans they don\u2019t have the protection that they do in the US. They do not care about losing retirement money, as long as it is in their best interest. They invest in risky businesses without having a good broker that has the same regulators as in the US.\n\nWe are talking about millions of dollars they are stealing from the pension funds, and no they do not care about this at all. Firefighters, hospital workers, teachers, they\u2019re basically scamming every single one of them for their own gains. They set these Shell funds up to protect themselves and nothing else. They care about 1 single person in the world and that is themself. So what is our duty now? Go out and show that this behaviour is no longer accepted, show them who's boss and that is US APES.[http://pensionpulse.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-grand-cayman-pension-scam.html](http://pensionpulse.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-grand-cayman-pension-scam.html) \n\nWe hope you all have enjoyed reading our research and this is only the surface that we\u2019re scraping right here.

        "selftext": "I would recommend everyone here take a few minutes to look into ReconAfrica (OTC: RECAF). I posted about them to this sub a few months ago just before they were spudding their first well, but we were in peak renewable energy hype at the time, and few people were looking to get into oil exploration plays.\n\n**So who are they?** \n\nReconnaissance Energy Africa (ReconAfrica) is a junior exploration company that has the exclusive rights to a newly discovered 30,000 ft deep sedimentary basin that lies beneath the Kalahari desert in Namibia. That Kavango sedimentary basin comprises *6.3 million acres* in Botswana and 2.45 million acres in neighboring Botswana. It\u2019s virtually unheard of for a small exploration company to hold the rights to such a large basin. \n\nWhy has the Kavango basin been missed for so long and how was it discovered now? You can listen to a video interview with the founder [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R1T7QwOnSQ), but it\u2019s mainly it\u2019s due to historical reasons and the fact that the Kavango basin is hidden underneath the Kalahari desert.\n\n**How much oil is there?**\n\nEstimated reserves will not be known until the basin is fully proven and explored, but geologists are estimating the Kavango may contain **tens of billions to hundreds of billions of barrels of oil** (as much as the entire Permian basin in Texas). See the [Jarvie report](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Postulated-Petroleum-Yields-V2.pdf) if you\u2019re interested in taking a closer look at the numbers.\n\nBill Cathey, founder of Earthfield Technology, and one of the world\u2019s leading geophysicists whose been in the business for 30+ years has said \u201cNowhere in the world is there a sedimentary basin this deep that does not produce commercial hydrocarbons.\u201d So even in the worst case, it is still very likely Recon is sitting on significant oil reserves. But in the best case, if the Kavango lives up to predictions we could be seeing an upside of more than 100x.\n\n**What\u2019s the timeline?**\n\nReconAfrica has planned for an initial 3-well exploratory program before beginning JV/farmout discussions. They are nearing total depth for the first well (we should be seeing a PR about that coming soon) and will soon be moving onto their second well. Once the core samples from these wells are analyzed, and if they yield good news you can expect the stock to jump quite a bit. And if oil is hit, you'll be in for some crazy gains.\n\n**How does this compare to 88 Energy?**\n\nI\u2019ve got a small bag of EEENF but personally, I\u2019m more bullish on RECAF because the upside potential really is staggering. At current prices, this will be insanely undervalued even with a small hit, and a 100+ bagger long term if the basin lives up to the predictions of the geologists. There's a very good [investor presentation](https://vimeo.com/480128335) from last November that covers the geology of the play and I highly recommend you take a look at it. Furthermore, from what I can tell from the investor forums, I believe owners of the stock so far have primarily been oil industry investors. We haven\u2019t seen a retail spike in RECAF yet so I can foresee a nice bump as more investors learn about the company and take the time to put in serious DD. At these levels, I consider Recon to be a very strong investment to put 10% of your portfolio in, and a serious contender for an early retirement stock.\n\n**Tl;dr** The last remaining onshore sedimentary basin in the world containing potentially hundreds of billions of dollars worth of oil and petroleum equivalents, and it is owned by one small company that is currently flying under the radar.",

I do have some high conviction funds eswell iam from the UK so most of you guys won't recognise these but you can reasherch them. So to start off my high conviction funds and trusts are Smithson investment trust, fundsmith equity, lindsel train global equity, Finsbury growth and income, Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust.\n\nHere's why I like these funds and why you should reasherch them\nSo with fundsmith equity it's ran by Terry Smith who's a legendary British Investor from 2003 to now he's averaged around 15% returns and what's even more impressive from 2003 to 2013 in the \"lost decade\" he averaged 14% return every year.\nHe also gets a say in the Smithson investment trust but he doesn't run it everyday and Terry also gets compared to warren buffet\nWith the lindsell train global equity and Finsbury growth and income they are both ran buy another legendary investor named nick train. He is a expert in the UK markets both his funds are diversified with exposure to Japan UK and USA.\nFinally to Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust. So these trust are similar to arkk funds and their parent company who controls the fund baillie Gifford were also at one point before the pandemic the second largest shareholder of Tesla just behind Elon musk they have sold some of Their stake after the impressive run up. The main reason I hold these trusts is because of the private company exposure\n\nSome honourable mentions are visa Mastercard and Adobe. I like them but won't buy them because of their valuations\n\nSo what are your highest conviction stocks and why ?",

A team of world-renowned oil exploration experts discovered a new, unexplored basin in Namibia and Botswana and promptly secured exploration rights to the entire area. ReconAfrica has purchased a drilling rig specifically for this drilling program and is working on confirming the presence of hydrocarbons in the Kavango Basin with [strong support](https://www.namibian.com.na/99647/read/Shifeta-defends-oil-drilling?fbclid=IwAR1PXrk8r5B4EpMfIW3x-r_acmH8e4vjh0q0GkGfDR9F__I_hmbT-_LRX6c) from the Namibian government.\n\nThe basin\u2019s age, size, and depth could make it the biggest oil discovery in recent history, resulting in [ReconAfrica becoming a potential African oil major](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397342-reconnaissance-energy-africa-potential-future-major-african-oil-and-gas-company).\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ SHORT TERM OPPORTUNITY**\n\nReconAfrica\u2019s drilling program currently consists of drilling 3 wells to confirm the presence of a working hydrocarbon system in the Kavango basin. An oversubscribed round of [funding](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/RECON-Update-3_25-Warrants_VOK2_Final.pdf) has just been completed, removing the need for any short term capital raise or share dilution for the foreseeable future. Well #1 total depth was projected for the [end of March](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Haywood-ReconAfrica-022521.pdf) and **an announcement is expected soon**. At the same time, the 450km 2D seismic program is expected to obtain approval shortly. These are significant milestones with a potential **2x upside** from the current \\~CDN$3.5 / \\~USD$2.5 to arrive at the [current price target of CAD$7.0](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Haywood-ReconAfrica-022521.pdf). The spudding of the second well and its completion is expected to be the next near-term catalyst. \n\nHowever, **the biggest near-term catalyst** awaits at the completion of Well #3. The drilling program requires all three wells being drilled to Total Depth (TD) before the release of any information about commercial productivity (see \u201cThe Plan\u201d). When Well #3 is completed, we get to see whether we have oil, as well as indications about possible quantities. \n\nHere is where it gets difficult to estimate an upside and numbers become speculative. The sheer size of the basin and the scale of potential reserves have inspired some wild share price [estimates](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation-092019.pdf) of [US$70](https://www.wallstreet-online.de/_plain/_shared/default/image?url=//assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/10511/board/20201209122208-reconnaissance-energy-africa-shale-play-valuation.jpg). I think this is unlikely. But because of the very high estimated potential reserves, I expect that a successful oil show could make share prices around CDN$24 / US$19 possible. An **\\~x8 upside**. It could be greater or smaller depending on the indications for oil quantity and quality. See \u201cThe Valuation\u201d. \n\nThe analyst firm Haywood Securities is tracking the progress of the drilling program and the catalysts, providing [update analyses and share price targets](https://reconafrica.com/investors/analyst-reports/). The last share price rally happened as the rig arrived and the drilling began - an important de-risking milestone. See \u201cThe Technicals\u201d for a summary of past price history and a technical analysis of the price chart. \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ LONG TERM SPECULATION**\n\nOnce the presence of a working hydrocarbon system is confirmed, the company will enter a [farm-out deal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/farmout.asp#:~:text=Farmout%20is%20the%20assignment%20of,exploration%20blocks%20or%20drilling%20acreage) to raise the funds needed to move to the appraisal stage, where the basin is thoroughly mapped and the estimates of its oil content are confirmed with the certainty required for production. Early expert estimates put the resource at 1.2 billion barrels, while more recent estimates put it between 40 and 120 billion (see \u201cThe Resource\u201d). \n\nIf we have 1.2 billion barrels, we get a nice rally. This is a quantity somewhat comparable to the 88 Energy opportunity.\n\n**However, If we have 40 billion or 120 billion barrels, then Namibia (a 2.5m population country) finds itself with resources close to the ones** [**in America or Kuwait**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves)**.** [**ReconAfrica could become a next oil major**](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397342-reconnaissance-energy-africa-potential-future-major-african-oil-and-gas-company)**.** \n\nYou could argue that estimating the share price if this happens is meaningless, but I made an attempt - see \u201cThe Valuation\u201d. \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE TEAM**\n\n*Sources: ReconAfrica website, LinkedIn, Google.*\n\n**Craig Steinke, the Founder,** has previously founded [Renaissance Oil](http://renaissanceoil.com/).

Below is a summary:\n\nAfter Craig Steinke\u2019s last project (see \u201cThe Team\u201d), the exploration expert bought a shale and source rock database from [IHS Markit](https://ihsmarkit.com/index.html) (one just like [this one](https://ihsmarkit.com/products/oil-gas-field-reservoir-discoveries.html)), hired four international geologists and tried to find overlooked opportunities. He found ST-1, a **1964 Etosha Petroleum** well, which identified 620\u2019 permian shale. While this early exploration effort found source rock, it failed to find oil, and further attempts were hampered by the political situation in Namibia at the time. You can find more details about other exploration efforts in the area [here](http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/pdfz/documents/2014/10609hoak/ndx_hoak.pdf.html). \n\nThe oil exploration industry has come a long way since 1964, and Craig had a hunch that Etosha was drilled in a shallower part of the basin. The team believed that the basement depth increased as you move further to the east. Craig contacted the Namibian government and found that they had an un-analysed aeromagnetic study available ([aeromagnetic surveys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromagnetic_survey) are used to visualise the geological structure of the upper crust). Based on his hunch and little else, **he preemptively acquired both the aeromag and the exploration rights.** [This contract](https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&amp;docClass=13&amp;issuerNo=00008235&amp;issuerType=03&amp;projectNo=03088140&amp;docId=4767862) was very much in Namibia\u2019s interest, as it committed ReconAfrica to spend a minimum $5m on exploration, as well as pay N$2m in licence fees and US$50,000 in Namibian training and education fund contributions per year (page 38 [here](http://www.eia.met.gov.na/screening/2250_public_and_stakeholders_consultions_materials_march_2021.pdf)).\n\nThe aeromag analysis was done by Bill Cathey (see \u201cThe Team\u201d). He found a **huge, completely unexplored 30,000\u2019 deep sedimentary basin\u2026** and the rest is history**.** He describes it in detail in his [conference presentation](https://youtu.be/sgniBroy2YQ?t=3068), and you can find a basic summary [here](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Bill-Cathey-ReconAfrica-Aeromagnetic-Analysis-1.pdf). You can also find Dan Jarvie\u2019s perspective on the finding [here](https://www.yahoo.com/news/largest-oil-play-decade-interview-000000645.html). \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE RESOURCE**\n\nWood Mackenzie, [a world-leading consultancy group, estimated](https://www.woodmac.com/) the Kavango basin to be [most similar to the US Midland (Permian) Basin](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Wood-Mac-Kavango-Basin-and-Global-Benchmarking-Nov-2020.pdf). The Permian has produced 33 billion barrels of oil ($1.8 trillion @ $55 per barrel) since 1921. It currently accounts for 20% of US crude production. ReconAfrica holds exploration rights to the entire Kavango basin, see \u201cThe Deal\u201d.\n\nWe are still in early stages and don\u2019t know much about the basin apart from its immense size and depth, as well as, according to Bill Cathey, the fact that there is no basin of this depth in the world that doesn\u2019t produce hydrocarbons.\n\nAn early estimate came to [1.2 billion barrels](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Sproule-Report-ReconAfrica-July-2020.pdf) (which, as the most conservative analysis, is used by [analysts](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Haywood-Report-November-2020.pdf) for share price targets), while a later estimate by Chief Geochemist Dan Jarvie came to between [40 and 120 billion barrels](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Dan-Jarvie-ReconAfrica-Geochemical-Analysis-1.pdf). You can watch Jarvie present his analysis at an [American Petroleum Institute conference](https://youtu.be/sgniBroy2YQ?t=3815), or read an [interview of his](https://www.yahoo.com/news/largest-oil-play-decade-interview-000000645.html). \n\n[An excerpt from a leaked investor presentation](https://youtu.be/-Kknjo3ygU4?t=1127): \u201cDan does believe \\[...\\] he is conservative. \\[...\\] The numbers are already so large that we don\u2019t need to press the numbers to make a compelling investment case\u201d\n\nWe will have to wait for more data to see which estimate is closer to the truth, and whether Jarvie is correct in being conservative. **But even if his lowest estimate pans out, we are in oil major territory**.

That is the potential scale of this play. \n\n**&gt;&gt;&gt;WHAT ABOUT FRACKING?**\n\nIf you work in O&amp;G in America, you will have little choice but to be heavily involved in fracking: the conventional resources have practically run out. This is why many of the ReconAfrica team have a fracking background, and why a lot of the early ReconAfrica documents mention fracking - it makes it more comparable to the current US plays. However, fracking is never the first choice due to its financial and environmental cost, as the company [repeatedly stated](https://twitter.com/Recon_Africa/status/1371571724559519748?s=20). \n\nReconAfrica is currently in the **exploration stage** and its mission is to confirm both [conventional and unconventional](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation.pdf) resources, so that Recon and the Namibian government know what is in the ground. Any production licences and discussions come further down the line. See \u201cThe Environment\u201d. \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE PLAN &amp; THE CATALYSTS**\n\nReconAfrica\u2019s exploration work is \u201cde-risking\u201d the basin in stages. **The current stage is confirming the presence of a working hydrocarbon system** through two stratigraphic wells, followed by 450km of 2D seismic and a trap well. [Stratigraphic wells](https://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=298&amp;c_id=) will acquire cores and well logging to map geological strata. [Seismography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_seismology) allows you to map subsurface features. [Trap wells](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Oil_and_gas_traps) look to hit oil. Well 1 should be complete near the end of March. Well 2 (\\~30 days) and the seismic will take place concurrently, so the final well (also \\~30 days) will be complete July earliest, and realistically at the start of Q3. \n\nWell #1 completion and 2D seismic study approval are expected to be the next big catalysts, followed by Well #2 and the exciting Well #3 which will **look for oil.** The data from the wells will be used to obtain a more accurate picture of the basin\u2019s contents. ReconAfrica will need this information to negotiate a **farm-out deal**, where they offer a % interest in the resource in exchange for the funds to complete the appraisal. \n\n**They will not release interim technical results** until the whole program is complete, so that they can be in the best negotiating position. However, they promised **plenty of operational updates**. Please review [the investor presentation from 18th January 2021 for details](https://youtu.be/-Kknjo3ygU4). \n\n**ReconAfrica is planning to negotiate the farm-out this summer.** It will bring in lots of capital, considerably de-risk the project, and be a big catalyst.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to put a SP estimate upon an oil show at the end of the program. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it **takes us to CDN$24 / US$19**, or more if the well logs indicate that we are closer to a 40 billion barrel situation than a 1 billion barrel situation - see the next section. Securing the farm-out deal will happen shortly after, serving as **another catalyst**.\n\nAfter this comes the appraisal of the entire basin\u2019s resources, with further wells and 3D seismic. As it goes on, **we should be getting closer and closer to the real picture of what\u2019s in the basin.** All current price targets are based on the most conservative target of 1.2bb. If early signs show we are closer to 40bb, the game changes dramatically.\n\nAs a small outfit ReconAfrica will **not develop the entire basin themselves.** That would take insane scale. Instead, they will seek to sign farm-out deals with large oil majors and secure crazy royalties. However, since they have in-house development experience, they will seek to produce as much as they can themselves as well (as mentioned [here](https://youtu.be/-Kknjo3ygU4)). \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE VALUATION**\n\nValuing exploration oil companies is tough. We still don\u2019t know much about the Kavango basin apart from its immense size and depth. The original estimate of reserves by Sproule came to 1.2bn barrels, while the later Jarvie estimate came between 40 and 120bb. [Haywood reports](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Haywood-ReconAfrica-022521.pdf) provide pricing (in CDN$) **based on the most conservative estimate** and \u201cchances of commerciality\u201d. This chance increases the closer we get to confirming the resource.\n\nI have found a [useful calculator](https://jscalc.io/calc/uJqKwGWLiSqOuoxA) someone made on another board, based on a model from [SeekingAlpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4334114-drilling-for-oil-in-stock-market) which uses assumptions from [this paper](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&amp;context=anrlaw). Assuming a 20% farm-out cut, US$55 per barrel and a 33% profit margin on each one, I estimated the USD share price (along with the upside from the current \\~US$2.5) for the different reserve estimates. I also looked at a [recent massive farm-out deal by Rosneft](https://www.reuters.com/article/rosneft-results/update-2-rosneft-holds-talks-with-global-traders-india-and-china-on-vostok-oil-project-idUSL1N2KI0KT) and applied the same valuation to ReconAfrica\u2019s reserves for comparison.\n\n**The prices are in USD with upside potential based on the current price of \\~US$2.5 in brackets.**\n\n|PRICES USD|Analyst reports|Model|Model|Model|Rosneft deal|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Bn barrels|Haywood|Reserves probable|Reserves proven|Reserves producing|US$2 per barrel deal|\n|1.2|$36.9 (x15)|$6.2 (x2)|$11.1 (x4)|$24.6 (x10)|$13.4 (x5)|\n|40|$1,231 (x492)|$207 (x83)|$370 (x148)|$820 (x328)|$448 (x179)|\n|120|$3,693 (x1477)|$620 (x248)|$1,110 (x444)|$2,460 (x984)|$1,345 (x538)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can kind of see why the analyst share price targets stuck to the earlier, most conservative estimate, as the **numbers get stupid very quickly**. In reality, I am sure these will be tempered by the actual farm-out agreements, further capital raises and the sheer time it takes to extract 40bn barrels (but note that the numbers above already assume a 20% royalty cut to account for farm-out deals). \n\nThis is what happens when you find a huge, overlooked basin and snatch the rights to the entire area. If you would like to see more detail on the 40-120bb estimate, I recommend Dan Jarvie\u2019s [conference presentation](https://youtu.be/sgniBroy2YQ?t=3815).\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE DEAL**\n\n**ReconAfrica\u2019s work** is currently subject to the [Petroleum Agreement](https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&amp;docClass=13&amp;issuerNo=00008235&amp;issuerType=03&amp;projectNo=03088140&amp;docId=4767862) with the Namibian government, giving them rights to an enormous 6.3m acre (\\~27,000km2) area, and a similar agreement with the Botswana government for 2.2m acres (\\~8,900km2). \n\n**In Namibia,** The Namibian state oil company NAMCOR holds a 10% stake in the exploration licence. Namibia gets a [5% royalty and a 35% corporate tax](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation.pdf), ensuring that a good portion of the profits will benefit the country\u2019s economy. \n\nOnce the exploration phases are complete, the company has **secured the right** to enter into a 25 year **production licence** with a NAMCOR stake to be negotiated, as specified in the [Petroleum Agreement](https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&amp;docClass=13&amp;issuerNo=00008235&amp;issuerType=03&amp;projectNo=03088140&amp;docId=4767862) and the recent seismic [Environmental Impact Assessment](http://www.eia.met.gov.na/screening/2250_vol_2_of_3_eia_report_for_the_proposed_2d_seismic_survey_of_aoi_in_pel_73_kavango_east_and_west_regions_march_2021.pdf). \n\n**In Botswana,** ReconAfrica holds a 100% working interest in all the petroleum in the area. The work is currently at the permit obtaining stage. Royalties will be [3% - 10% and a 22% corporate income tax](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation.pdf).\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE RISKS**\n\n**Short-term risk** is mainly in the 3 well program failing to find oil. In this scenario, the share price will likely suffer a significant drop. However, since the company has already secured additional funding, it would simply mean additional delay (see \u201cThe Fundamentals\u201d).\n\n**Longer-term risks** include:\n\n* Failure to confirm oil with further wells. In this case, share price goes to 0.\n* The basin not yielding a commercialisable resource. In this case, the share price also goes to 0.\n* The basin yielding only an unconventional (fracking) resource, the extraction of which will encounter considerable opposition.\n* Environmental concerns halting exploration. While we are getting increasing news exposure, I consider this extremely unlikely, as the exploration stage involves no oil production and has minimal environmental impact. **As long as there is the prospect for any oil, the Namibian government will want to find out whether it\u2019s there.**\n* Oil prices going down. I don\u2019t consider this to be a major risk with oil prices projected to increase with reflation, and conventional oil being relatively cheap to extract. The oil prices will be far more relevant to the production stage, which will happen further down the line. Hear Craig talk about this [here at around 17:00](https://podcasts.apple.com/mr/podcast/africas-kavango-basin-craig-steinke-founder-recon-africa/id1450833136?i=1000498202543).\n\n*This is very much a high risk, high reward, near-binary play.*\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE \u201cFUNDAMENTALS\u201d**\n\nAs a junior oil exploration company, ReconAfrica is not a fundamentals based opportunity. However, they have:\n\n* Their own [1,000hp drilling rig](https://reconafrica.com/operations/crown-750-1000-hp-drilling-rig/). Rig ownership reduces costs by 60%.\n* [Funds for the entire program](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Closing-2020-08-20.pdf) (3 wells + seismic) with $4m margin leftover.\n* Additional [\\~$33m](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/RECON-Update-3_25-Warrants_VOK2_Final.pdf) from a recent warrants release.\n* [Zero debt.](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation.pdf)\n\nThis means they have sufficient funds to take their time and get it right, as well as to complete **up to 6 additional wells** if required at [\\~$4m per well](https://leedejonesgable.com/wp-content/uploads/reconafrica-0811.pdf)  \\- all without **any additional dilution.** Note that this is based on my own calculations from their financial statements, and not on company commitments. \n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE TECHNICALS** \n\n**The last catalyst was caused by the start of drilling on January 10th**, and had an x2 upside. Recently, the price has suffered a bit due to the well delay and the ongoing macro conditions. Due to low volume in-between the catalysts, it tends to track the Russell 2000. Recently, a massive **bullish pennant** has been forming, which together with low volume is showing the price is well-consolidated for a new catalyst. This stock is still flying under the radar. \n\n**I made some charts for you:**\n\n* [A chart with the last rally and all the major events.](https://i.imgur.com/OGPuMRZ.png)\n* [A tidier chart showing all events since November 2020.](https://i.imgur.com/eUxI0Fx.png)\n* [A chart showing how RECO has drifted on market sentiment in March.](https://i.imgur.com/70YMWNg.png)\n* [A chart showing the bullish pennant.](https://i.imgur.com/UicDl0N.png)\n* [A chart showing the tip of the pennant, the \u201ccatalyst launchpad\u201d and the most relevant support levels right now.](https://i.imgur.com/BiOx0F4.png)\n\nImgur seems to be reducing resolution on mobile, so if you\u2019re on a phone, try \u201cRequest Desktop Site\u201d or view these links on a computer.\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE ENVIRONMENT**\n\nThere has been some environmental news coverage of ReconAfrica\u2019s efforts. A lot of the articles don\u2019t seem to grasp that **ReconAfrica is in the exploration stage** with the goal of confirming the presence of oil. If oil is confirmed, it will take some time and negotiation to get to production. I expect the negotiations to get quite political. This does not affect us for this phase. ReconAfrica is under contract with the Namibian government to **tell their country how much oil they have.** \n\nIf the government finds itself in possession of an **oil resource the size of Kuwait\u2019s**, it will have to choose whether the benefits of extraction outweigh possible environmental risks. I look at this play as a low environmental impact **oil exploration opportunity** with the goal of confirming the resource and fully appraising it. What happens after dramatically changes depending on what quantity of oil is found. \n\n**ReconAfrica is fully in compliance with Namibia\u2019s stringent environmental protection laws:** they are using an expensive, biodegradable and fully [environmentally safe](https://www.energy-pedia.com/news/namibia/new-182148) drilling fluid**.** The seismic analysis has been subject to a detailed [Environmental Impact Assessment](http://www.eia.met.gov.na/screening/2250_vol_2_of_3_eia_report_for_the_proposed_2d_seismic_survey_of_aoi_in_pel_73_kavango_east_and_west_regions_march_2021.pdf) and [Environmental Management Plan](http://www.eia.met.gov.na/screening/2250_vol_3_of_3_emp_report_for_the_proposed_2d_seismic_survey_of_aoi_in_pel_73_kavango_east_and_west_regions_march_2021.pdf), with [extensive local consultation](http://www.eia.met.gov.na/screening/2250_public_and_stakeholders_consultions_materials_march_2021.pdf).

See [a recent TV interview](https://www.facebook.com/www.nbcnews.na/videos/793867861512115) for the view of the Namibian government.\n\n**\\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_** \n\n**\\\\\\\\\\\\ THE COUNTRY**\n\n**Namibia** represents the lion\u2019s share of the Kavango basin\u2019s area. It is a former German colony, gaining independence from South Africa in 1990. A stable, multi-party parliamentary democracy, [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia) has a small population of 2.5m people with a nominal GDP of US$14.15bn. \n\nFor comparison, the most conservative estimate of 1.2bn barrels would generate a revenue of US$66bn at US$55 per barrel. With over [20% unemployment](https://www.statista.com/statistics/808804/unemployment-rate-in-namibia/), and being one of the few countries in the area [with no proven oil reserves](https://www.ecooilandgas.com/bp-pursues-namibia-crude-amid-no-known-discovery-of-oil-energy/#:~:text=Namibia%2C%20sandwiched%20between%20Angola%2C%20South,to%20generate%20power%20this%20year.), **it simply** **cannot afford not to produce oil.** Under the current deal, the government will receive 35% corporate tax, and 5% in royalties and 10% through its stake in the area. [Recent government statements](https://www.namibian.com.na/99647/read/Shifeta-defends-oil-drilling?fbclid=IwAR1PXrk8r5B4EpMfIW3x-r_acmH8e4vjh0q0GkGfDR9F__I_hmbT-_LRX6c) and [TV interviews](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=793867861512115&amp;ref=watch_permalink) show strong support of ReconAfrica\u2019s current efforts.

We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation.\n\n* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**  \n\n* How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**  \n\n* What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**  \n\n*  Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**  \n\n* What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(Autodesk DD Complete)**  \n\n* Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? **(YOU ARE HERE)**  \n\n* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? **(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)**  \n\n* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# Video Games &amp; Heutagogic Learning\n\nIt appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:\n\n1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.\n\n2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)\n\nOne must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)\n\nI\u2019ve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:\n\n&gt;\"An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:  \n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. Google is fueled by customer\u2019s need for answered information.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Online video games are fueled by a customer\u2019s need for adventure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Reddit is fueled by a customer\u2019s need for community.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; 4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer\u2019s need for ideas.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;5. Facebook is fueled by a customer\u2019s need to connect.\"\n\nIn this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The investment incentive: low barrier to entry &amp; decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)\n\nI typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)\n\nOnline games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.\n\n2. The ability to deeply engage.\n\n3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.\n\nSome of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games. \n\nThis is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of \"learning the game\"  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.  \n\n\n[Andragogic\\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)\n\nI could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:\n\n1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.\n\n2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.\n\n3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Second generation online gaming](https://preview.redd.it/4bt555i62qt61.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c281084802f3ff72cb8143b40761bde4fa9e5ed)\n\nSome of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.\n\nYet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)\n\nWith that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:\n\n1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)\n\n2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)\n\n3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)\n\nWhat an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.  \n\nHowever, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.\n\nA young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:\n\n&gt; \u201cWhy do I need to learn this?\u201d\n\nIt turns out, the answer is not \n\n&gt;\u201cso you can become a scientist!\u201d \n\nbut to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality\n\n&gt;\u201cI need to learn this, so that I can create that.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEngineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.  \n\nSome of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)\n\nAnother huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.\n\nYou may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:\n\n1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.\n\n2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.\n\n3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.\n\nThis language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989. \n\n&gt;\"The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1989](https://preview.redd.it/s0pl9rby5qt61.png?width=583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2aba26a92988fee33e889e1bc394a3a226216978)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Roblox Vision\n\n&gt;\"We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z63prfzr6qt61.png?width=467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faad3efe3a156c1f26e4adadefb20346466bb37e)\n\nUnderstanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.\n\n1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).\n\n2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input). \n\n[Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)\n\nThere are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as \"disruption\". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vpzpov6deqt61.png?width=845&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0128b3dd2ee4912161dbfc99c9d312b8f57f9b6c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:\n\n1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.\n\n2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.\n\n3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)\n\n4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956\n\nThe reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:\n\n1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.\n\n2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.\n\n3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer\u2019s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user\u2019s monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440\n\nIn my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.\n\nSome uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.\n\nAnother example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12\n\nThe possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g33ivkwaqt61.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6ff4e2b37801f0ee02fa70d46b8fa636bc5455b\n\nAnother core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:\n\n&gt;\" At Roblox, we\u2019re continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we\u2019ve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there\u2019s an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is **Robox**.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f3ekqlxbcqt61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b570d094f476c8fb211a2c68e02e0617b8f78c91\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThere was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.  \n\n\nA significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCover: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdytQnMWkAM4SbN.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdytQnMWkAM4SbN.jpg)",

        "selftext": "Greetings! I posted this in r/cars, but I am also very interesting in your input on this, having an (admittedly hobby level) interest in both cars and investments through stocks.  Who do you think will be the future winners? Technology wise, we are seeing an increased pace of development, further surged by COVID. How will giants like VW, Daimler, GM and BMW fare? The common thread among these are they are all relatively low priced. VW is heading to become the largest EV maker in 2023, Daimler and BMW are making luxury cars competing with Tesla and the Chinese, and GM seem to have plans to retake the American markeds (I am personally skeptical of the latter, but we will see)  \n\n\nVW has already gone up 40% this year, \u20ac 243 as we speak, and once it passes 325 it will go past a Price/Earnings rate of 10.   \n\n\nHow about Hyundai? They recently laid down a plan for further EV development, decreasing production cost. It is likely this will mean their profits will increase despite high investments, which is not reflected in today's value.   \n\n\nHow about the reigning kings? Toyota Motor Corporation are the world's largest in terms of production volume, being okay priced with a P/E rating of 10. Their insistence on hydrogen as a fuel source is certainly very interesting, and it should be noted they actually don't have a single pure EV in their range currently. Will the future development be hydrogen driven?   \n\n\nBMW are also currently well run, with a P/E of 8.5. The public seems to gobble them up, despite some ... unconventional and arguably arrogant decisions not taken lightly by the enthusiasts and older fanbase.  \n\n\nPorsche, which I admittedly am a bit biased for (still aiming for a 911 at some point), already had a large surge - and I wish I got into the stocks during January. Is it too late though?  According to Chris Harris on a [Top Gear video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gTZ9QRTtfQ) posted yesterday, they are set for some very interesting developments, switching over to alternative fuels, and now targeting the Macan crowd, after surging Taycan sales (which I can anecdotally attest to, I see dozens every day here in the EV capital of Norway, Oslo). They also have some of their best, Frank Walliser, at their helm, which seems promising. \n\nHow about the Chinese? Dongfeng Motor and Saic motors? They seem cheap, but I am still skeptical of their capabilities and reputation. \n\nFinally here is a compilation of companies, (credit goes to a Norwegian article summarizing this issue). My personal favorites which I am looking to invest into are highlighted in bold.\n\nAs 2021 marches on which one of these companies would you place your bets on, personally? Why/why not? How do you think technology development, regulations and stricter rules as well as consumer habits shape the future?   \n\n\n|COMPANY|COUNTRY|P/E RATE|RETURN SO FAR 2021|RETURN 1 YEAR|MARKET VALUE (BILLION USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Toyota Motor Corp**|JPN|10|4 %|39 %|249|\n|**Bayerische Motoren Werke AG** |GER|9|16 %|120 %|65|\n|**Porsche Automobil** |GER|7|67 %|203 %|35|\n|Dongfeng Motor |CHINA|4|\\- 20 %|77 %|8|\n|Saic Motor |CHINA|8|\\- 17 %|21 %|37|\n|Honda Motor |JPN|9|15 %|54 %|55|\n|Daimler|GER|8|27 %|224 %|94|\n|**Hyundai**  |KOR|9|18 %|234 %|43|\n\n  \n\nThank you!",

        "selftext": "Paysafe is a new entrant to the fintech field. They went public via spac titled ' **Foley Trasimene Acquisition II Corp** '. And just like every other SPAC in the last 6 months, the stock price has run up then gotten crushed. I personally hate spacs, however if the underlying company is valuable once the merger is complete they can be a good investment.\n\n The Spac is sponsored by Bill Foley, a notable entertainment investor. He made a fortune investing in wineries, golf courses, sports franchises, and hotels. Their CEO is Phil Mchugh, who has a track record working at citibank and barclays. Overall the management team seems pretty impressive. (Especially considering citi handles all wire transfers on earth. The CEO has a lot of experience with credit and merchant payments. I did notice that his linkdin profile is written in the third person, which could be a red flag. \n\nPaysafe is fundamentally a transaction handler. They serve mostly medium and smaller merchants, and transfer money between merchants, currencies, and forms of credit. They have some larger customers, notably including fortnite, twitch, and spotify. The firm handled 92 billion $ of transactions in 2020. They focus much of their business on gaming, and gambling. Which are both attractive and growing markets. \n\nTaking a look at the companies SEC filings, the notable risk factors they list include risk due to brexit, risk of accidentally processing fraudulent claims, and heavy reliance on third parties for much of their processes (payment processing, banking, routing/connectivity, customer support, IT). This leaves me with the question what do they really do? My understanding is that the company provides value to customers by the middleman and acting as a connection between merchants, local banks, and larger financial institutions. They process payments and take a processing fee. \n\nOther notable risks would be the major competitors that the company faces in the fintech world. They are partnered with visa and mastercard, but will have to compete with COIN, SQ, SOFI and many others. \n\nAdvantages? The firm has a solid hold in the European and international markets. It's in a quickly growing industry, and has good leadership. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinances.\n\nPSFE has a market cap of 2.47 Billion$(despite being purchased for $9billion, hmm). Their trailing 12 months revenue is $1.4 billion, and their gross profit was $891 million or 62.5%, very nice. \n\nThe market cap/gross profit ratio is 2.47bil/891mil=2.77. At this ratio the company is very attractively priced. (If you bought the entire company, you'd make 100% profit in 2.77 years assuming no change in valuation). For reference, this ratio on a few other firms.\n\nPLTR-68\n\nCOST-6.3\n\nAAPL-19.1\n\nMCD- 17.1\n\nINTC-6.03\n\nSPOT-27\n\nSQ-42.6\n\nPYPL-31.6\n\nVISA-28.8\n\nRelatively speaking, the price/earnings on this company is really low. Especially compared to their most similar competitors PYPL and SQ. \n\nTaking a look at the balance sheet it isn't so sexy, they have a lot of liabilities and long term debt. Not the worst I've seen, they still have more assets. Their quick ratio is 1.35. Perhaps this explains the low P/E. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, the company has stiff competition, but good leadership and valuable customers. They are also specializing in a very attractive market. The company is very undervalued in my opinion, and could potentially have a significant run up to reach a more reasonable multiplier. If it's multiplier were to be similar to its peer (SQ,PYPL), the company would 15x in valuation. \n\nI started off this DD hating this company because it was a SPAC, however after looking into it I think I may invest.",

        "selftext": "Remember that there is no chip shortage. It's a chip demand. AMD is making more chips than they ever have in their history but demand is even greater than that. For an explanation, see this on youtube /watch?v=3A4yk-P5ukY So when AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su says that the chip shortage is a good thing for AMD, you can start to understand why. And also start to understand why AMD's stock can soar on earnings.\n\nThe news article on AMD increasing production in English is here:\n\n[https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/)\n\nThey're getting the information from Channel Gate, which is in Chinese. It says that AMD will increase chip supply by 20% in Q2 compared to Q1. Now, this is rumors so the market isn't making any moves based on it yet, but it's likely that this means AMD is increasing chip production by 20% in Q2 relative to Q1. This follows Dr. Lisa Su saying that they are working on ways of increasing production to meet demand in an interview with Cramer a few weeks ago. You can find that interview on youtube /watch?v=h5HiWsAzahc So the rumor is likely true here.\n\nBecause AMD is selling everything they make, the increase in production will translate directly into an increase in earnings. Therefor, I expect AMD to make the official announcement of the increase in production along side a revised earnings expectation for the year in the next earnings report. In this market, you can't just beat earnings, you have to increase earnings expectations going forward, and that's what I believe will happen with the increase in production.\n\nAnother, unrelated positive for the company is that, due to retailers jacking up prices on AMD products, AMD has started to sell more and more of their products directly from their own store, cutting out the middle man. [https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us](https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us) They're doing this to \"ensure gamers can get AMD products at MSRP\" But really it means AMD is making an extra 20% off each chip. Brilliant.\n\nI've been posting over the last month that I believe AMD is going to $120 and the jump will happen within the next 3 months. I still think this is true.\n\nMy AMD Positions: 550 shares, 55 calls spread from April 2021 to June 2022 at prices from $90 to $175",

        "selftext": "A long time ago, back in 2013, I started out with a very small sum on money and subsequently hit the jackpot with my 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th option trade. Hitting those consecutive wins really jacked me up (cash-wise and ego-wise). I was just out of college and really began to think I had everything all figured out. Well, as it turned out, I really didn't. I started to lose everything I had gained and clearly I was 'the' fool in the equation.\n\nAt around that time one of my favorite movies was The Dark Knight Rises. I would watch it alllll the time when it was on TV. And one day, on a bad-bad-bad market day, I was watching the movie and arrived at this scene:\n\nyou(remove-me)tube.com/watch?v=mdM46G984vw\n\nI had an epiphany when I heard the line...I had let victory defeat me. I let those wins cloud my judgement and it made me think I was more than I was. The lucky series of events got to my head and it was clear that I had fallen into this trap of weakness-by-winning.\n\nOver the years I never really forget that phrase. I started to live that phrase in the market - never letting my guard down during the best of times, never letting myself feel like I won...no matter how high the portfolio went. And over time I was able to correct those mistakes I made by ending my option addiction and simply buying stock (cough Tesla cough). And through all the ups and downs over the years, I always kept that phrase in my mind. For awhile it was even my alarm message, so that every morning when the market opened, I ALWAYS remembered how foolish I was in the past.\n\nUltimately keeping my guard up and never declaring victory led me to the promised land. I now have more cash than I'll ever need. But never again did I let victory defeat me. And eventually not only had I surpassed every financial goal I had set out to achieve, I did it in 7 years instead of 17 years...way earlier than I expected. And now, in a weird way, victory can never defeat me - because I'm not even sitting at the table. Yes I still own stock, a lot of stock, but there's no expiration date and my life no longer revolves around the drama of the day.\n\nMany folks will tell you to \"extend your goals\". Yeah no...that doesn't apply to everything. Sometimes enough money is enough money. Sure, $2 million would be nice...and maybe I'll hit that mark someday soon...but you don't risk everything for more. The first $500k is life-changing, the 2nd $500k not-so-much...so don't risk life-changing money if you have it. There's no harm in hitting 10 home-runs in a row sometimes...you don't need an 11th. And if you keep chasing that dragon, sometimes the dragon chases you back.\n\nAnd so I leave you all with the quote - Victory Has Defeated You - live it, love it, learn it. Don't let your guard down. Remember, Wall Street is no one friend...if you want a friend on Wall Street, get a dog. And remember to never let your wins make you a loser.\n\nHave a good night :)\n\nP.S. - I'm not Bane.",

        "selftext": "I posted a DD on RFP a month ago.  Since then this stock has surged almost 60%, including an epic 15% jump last Friday when the housing starts numbers were published and showed massive increase in construction since February; which I said it would a month ago.  \n\nI\u2019ve been getting a lot of messages recently asking if this stock is still worth buying or what\u2019s my PT.  I am not going to suggest a PT or tell anyone whether they should buy this stock or when to sell if they bought it.  Everyone has their own risk tolerance and investing style.  \n\nHowever, I am willing share the main data points (positive and negative) that I have so far focused on which will explain why I haven\u2019t sold any of my shares yet, nor plan to in the next few weeks.  If you see flaws in the data/analysis, please share.  I am not a financial analyst.  I can\u2019t give you advice.  I am just going to share with you why I am still sticking with this stock.  \n\n**Brief History Description**\n\nIf you want a brief history description on this company, you can go to [my old DD on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m8tj0f/dd_on_rfp_a_lumber_value_play_poised_to_have_its/)\n\nThe only thing I will add: here\u2019s a [very recent interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-04-15/lumber-prices-are-rising-like-i-have-never-seen-before-stinson-dean-video) from a lumber distributor/trader giving a good interview on why lumber is so high, and will continue to be high for a while.  If you look at analyst projections for the major homebuilders, like LEN, DHI, TOL, etc\u2026 they all expect the homebuilders to see continuously increasing earnings for this year and 2022.  If they plan on building like crazy for the foreseeable future, that\u2019s great news for companies like RFP.\n\n**Present Day Conditions**\n\nYTD RFP is up 126% and 812% for the year.  As with any stock, the higher it climbs, the more you should expect resistance (little dips) from profit taking.  There may be a dip on Monday after last Friday\u2019s insane rally.  When I posted in March that this was an undervalued stock, there were many people saying the lumber surge was over and the stock had peaked.  They were wrong :). Now let\u2019s look at what\u2019s changed in the last 30 days now that the stock is up 60% since then.\n\n**Bear Case Considerations**\n\nI want to start with possible downsides to consider.  First, this stock is almost now trading at its 5 year high  (Current price \u2013 14.78; 5-year High was 15.50 in 2018).  The stock hasn\u2019t traded in the 20s and 30s in over a half a decade.  So expect more turbulence and resistance on the way there.\n\nSecond, this is a cyclical stock.  Cyclicals do great until they don\u2019t.  This stock will likely start a decline right before the decline in earnings shows up in an earnings statement.  A great analogy for exit strategies on cyclicals is: You want to leave the party while you\u2019re still having fun.  To see a great example this, look at RFP\u2019s stock price trajectory in Fall 2018, right before it\u2019s Q3 earnings announcement on November 2, 2018.  Q3 was its best earnings for the year, but the stock was already declining from its 52WK high because lumber and wood pulp prices were crashing prior to that November announcement.  \n\nThird, the trailing PE is now ~135.  So there is absolutely some futures earning priced in at this point.  However, for reason\u2019s I\u2019ll explain later, this PE is very misleading because of an accounting quirk from Q4 2020. \n\nFour, dimensional lumber already has surged over 300% to ~ $1200-1300 MBF in the cash markets.  While those prices may surge a tiny bit more in the next couple months, it\u2019s highly unlikely that there will be much more growth in price; a very important consideration for a cyclical stock.\n\nFifth, who the heck knows what Covid still has in store, if anything.  There was a recent lockdown order for Ontario (where some RFP facilities are) due to a spike in Covid cases.  Things like this could cut into RFP\u2019s bottom line.  Hard to say how much if at all.\n\nSixth, they still have some pension liabilities that need to be paid for and will certainly mute the full impact of earnings (meaning less re-investment or less dividend potential) until these liabilities are fully paid off.  These pension liabilities could be a major factor decreasing the perceived fair value of the stock in the eyes of the institutional investors/HF\u2019s.\n\n**Why The Bear Case Doesn\u2019t Scare Me Yet**\n\n1)\tI like Peter Lynch\u2019s perspective that past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future performance.  800% growth doesn\u2019t mean it will stop growing nor does it mean the stock will continue to grow.  What matters is whether the future earnings coming down the road justify further growth.  If they do, stay the course.\n\n2)\tWhile the pattern of cyclicals means there will be a peak and a drop from that peak, what\u2019s different with this particular company is that it was trading at ridiculous lows, and if they finish paying off their debt this year (which I think they will), that combined with the improvements they\u2019ve made in 2020 and 2021, the resting run rate of this stock has a good chance of being higher than it was before this cycle started.  If it does, and you ask me how much higher will than normal run rate be? I have no fucking clue.  Anyone who claims to is talking out of their ass. \n\n3)\tThe trailing PE is high, and a good portion of Q1 earnings is priced in, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fully priced in for two reasons.  First, in Q4 RFP did an $80 Million writeoff for the idling of two newsprint mills\u2014a one-time accounting expense that wasn\u2019t a literal cash expenditure\u2014which put them in the negative for that quarter and a EPS of 10 cents for 2020.  *If you remove that write off, their current PE would be in the ballpark of 13-14.*  \n\nSecond, Q1\u2019s average projected EPS is $1.66.  I think they will beat it, but let\u2019s say they don\u2019t.  Then the trailing EPS will be $1.77 and give you a PE of 8.3 at the current price.  If you go for the adjusted PE that doesn\u2019t include the writeoff, that would make the trailing EPS about ~$2.77 which would give an adjusted TTM PE of 5.33 at current price.  So, either way the company is still undervalued when Q1 earnings gets added in.\n\n4)\tDimensional lumber will probably hit its peak in the next couple months.  That being said, because of what\u2019s driving this massive surge in prices (massive growth in housing construction and remodeling), unlike in 2018, I don\u2019t think the price will drop fast after it hits the peak.  Consistent with that, if you look at [dimensional lumber futures here]( https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/lumber-and-pulp/random-length-lumber.html#), you can see that the futures market right now is expecting lumber to stay 2-3x it\u2019s 2019 price for the rest of year, and possibly into 2022.\n\n**Current Valuation Metrics compared to other Lumber Players**\n\nEven with the awesome rally in the last month, here\u2019s RFP valuation ratios\n\n    **RFP**\n    P/E\t\t\t    135\n    Forward P/E\t\t3.86\n    Price/Sales\t\t  .42\n    Price/Book\t\t1.19\n    Price/Cash flow\t6.57\n\nNow let\u2019s compare RFP\u2019s ratios to similar forestry/lumber producers (WFG, WY, LPX, IFSPF and CFPZF) ([Link to screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/syWoh0F)):\n\n    ** Forestry/Lumber Avg**\n    P/E\t\t\t      15.2\n    Forward P/E\t\t  10.1\n    Price/Sales\t\t  2.1\n    Price/Book\t       4.4\n    Price/Cash flow\t  11.4\n\t\t\nTakeaways: 1) RFP *still* has the best forward PE, price-to-sales ratio, price-to-book ratio. 2) It has the highest trailing PE, but again, if you remove the newsprint mill write-off, it is actually sitting right below the average, 3) Interfor and Canfor have slightly better price-to-cashflow, but RFP is substantially better than WY, WFG, and LPX.  Overall, RFP still has the best overall ratio picture and best forward-looking position, even after this 60% rally.\n\n**The Bullish Case for 2021**\n\nI am not going repeat what I wrote in the last post.  To see the things I listed to support a bull case a month ago, [here\u2019s the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m8tj0f/dd_on_rfp_a_lumber_value_play_poised_to_have_its/)\n\n*Future Lumber outlook has dramatically improved but analysts haven\u2019t yet accounted for it.*\n\nMyself and other RFP longs have been banging our heads for months now, because the 4 analysts who cover RFP so far still refuse to acknowledge the complete reality of the surge in lumber prices.  [Here\u2019s a snapshot of average analyst quarterly EPS projections for 2021]( https://imgur.com/a/qepFiqC).  If you look up the other lumber stocks, they make all the same projections of mediocre Q2 and then Q3/Q4 dropping off hard.  \n\nThe issue is that the avg lumber price for Q1 will probably fall in the ballpark of 800-950.  (Remember there is a 9% duty for the lumber produced in Canada).  However, the avg price for Q2 will absolutely be over $1000 MBF.  So profits from lumber should be higher in Q2 than Q1.  And given the volume and price surge for the futures in the Q3 months (July futures currently trading over $1100 MBF), Q3 will almost certainly have a higher EPS than Q1, much less the current analysts\u2019 projections for Q3.\n\nAlso, by end of June, RFP\u2019s three US mills they bought in 2020 should be running at full capacity according to the last earnings transcript.  At full capacity they increase the companies lumber production by ~25%.  So this only further adds to the extra sales/profit to be expect after Q2, compared to Q1.\n\n**But here\u2019s a decent way for you to do your own math for the value of the lumber segment:**\n\nFor RFP, assume $400 costs USD. There may be a few other costs to factor in, but not that much. May be $50 for longer shipping distances or whatnot. So, at $1000 MBF, you get about $500 cash margins.  At $1200 (which is still lower than the current cash price) you get $700 cash margins.\n\nRFP will probably produce around 2.5 billion feet of lumber, so prices of $1000 per thousand feet let\u2019s you do the math. I\u2019d use a lower realization given the duty and we don\u2019t know yet how Q4 will look.  So let\u2019s call it $900 avg for year. So that roughly gives us margins of $450 USD per thousand feet on 2.5 billion of feet. So that\u2019s **$1.12B in cash earnings \u2014 or about $14/share \u2014 for 2021.**  Depreciation/Amortization should take a chuck of that away so I don\u2019t think that will be pure GAAP net income.  But still, pretty decent for a stock currently valued at $14.78, or a market cap of 1.2 billion.  *And that\u2019s just the lumber segment.*  \n\nSo for those wondering if the party is over, ask yourself, how many companies are likely to produce their current market cap in EBITDA in the next year from just *one* of their business segments\u2026? Food for thought on the current valuation. : )\n\n*But Wait, there\u2019s More!*\n\nPutting aside all the cash the lumber segment is printing, the Paper and Pulp sectors also appear to be doing well and likely will boost profits in Q2/Q3, at a minimum.\n\nUnfortunately, the current prices of paper and wood pulp are much more opaque and harder to preemptively track.  However, there are some limited free resources out there and they seem to show upward trajectory starting at the beginning of Q1 and continuing to grow in Q2, which means we should expect higher Paper/Pulp profits in Q2, and Q3 if trend holds.  Since it is harder for me to figure out all the drivers of this surge (beyond economy reopening and China\u2019s ban on non-degradable single-use plastics), I don\u2019t have the confidence to look beyond Q3 for now on these two areas.\n\nIn terms of what I use to try and get a feel for these two areas: \n\n1)\tThe closest thing to a futures market indicator for pulp. ([Shanghai Futures Market]( https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21/futures-prices))  The value is in yuan so you have to convert the currency yourself.  It is a relatively recent and speculative market, but it so far has generally done a decent job of acting as a mirror of the general wood pulp market.  As long as these futures are up, that\u2019s a decent indicator of what\u2019s currently going on in pulp world generally.\n\n2)\tThere are couple of analysts who give little tidbits when companies, including RFP and its competitors, announce price increases on pulp. [I follow this editor]( https://twitter.com/bryansmithrisi?lang=en).  I don\u2019t pay for his service.  But if you scroll through his feed (or search twitter for the terms \u201cNBSK price\u201d and \u201cSBSK Price\u201d you\u2019ll see his tweets in the last few months announcing price increases to RFP\u2019s two main types of pulp in the last few months, both by RFP and its competitors. If you do that, you\u2019ll see big price increases being announced, many of which are effective during Q2.  So I expect Q2 and beyond to do better than Q1 in those areas as well.\n\n3)\tFor Paper, this one is the hardest.  This was a [recent article]( https://www.specialtyprintcomm.com/blog/paper-market-update-paper-prices-continue-increase/) that talks about the type of paper RFP produces and that indicates prices are going up.  But beyond that, as the economy opens back up, paper profits are expected to increase from 2020 levels.  So I think this will get better over the next few quarters, compared to last year.  \n\nOverall, it\u2019s hard to say for sure what this means for true earnings for the year, but in terms of how I am planning my own exit strategies on this stock, I think there are major upward revisions coming to analyst projections after Q1 Earnings on April 29 and probably again during the summer, largely because lumber\u2019s historically increased price probably isn\u2019t going away any time soon.   \n\n*RFP has a major additional earnings booster hiding in its financials which aren\u2019t reflected in the valuation metrics but will be in the next few quarters*\n\nHere\u2019s an awesome nugget I recently realized that isn\u2019t reflected in the valuation ratios, but I think it will help propel the book value/EV of RFP\u2018s earnings and the ultimate EPS.\n\nHere\u2019s [a screenshot of RFP\u2019s 2020 10-K, specifically it\u2019s deferred tax assets]( https://imgur.com/a/tzwjlhM).  If you don\u2019t know what a deferred tax asset is, especially loss carryforwards, google it or watch a Youtube video on it.  If you don\u2019t know what valuation allowance, it\u2019s **very important** you look it up to understand this bit.  \n\nEssentially, because of the massive losses RFP sustained over the last decade while it transformed itself, it has over $800 million dollars in loss carryforwards and tax credits which it can use to pay virtually no taxes on the likely 100s of millions of dollars in earnings it will generate in the immediate future.  \n\nHere\u2019s the real critical point, those carryforward losses largely aren\u2019t reflected in the book value/enterprise value of the company because of that 774-million-dollar valuation allowance which was essentially a write off of those deferred tax assets. \n\nMeaning, as RFP starts to generate more earnings, some of that valuation allowance will likely be undone, so that the loss carryforwards can be used, and when it does, the reversal of those valuation allowances will look like extra earnings/EPS on the books. Meaning, if they remove $160 million of VA to account for the use of the same DTA\u2019s to avoid paying taxes on 2021 earnings, that will look like an extra $2 EPS for 2021.  Given that the current enterprise value is only 1.63 billion, if the total valuation allowance was reversed tomorrow that would cause an immediate increase in their enterprise value of  47% and would look like a net income of $9.69 EPS\u2026.\n\nRFP probably isn\u2019t going to do it all at once but that gives you a sense of the scale of net income that will be added to RFP\u2019s books in the coming quarters/years as they generate profits and RFP removes the valuation allowance negating the book value of the DTAs they previously wrote-off.\n\n*If the Canadian Lumber tariff is removed, this would result in an instant windfall for RFP.*\n\nI\u2019ve been asked how the politics of the tariff could affect RFP.  The answer is, it would be incredible for RFP if the tariff is removed. Right now, pressure is building from the homebuilders associations and from Canada to have the US remove the 9% tariff on Canadian lumber. I have no clue when or if this will happen and won\u2019t speculate on that issue.\n\nBUT, if the tariff is removed, RFP gets all the money it has set aside to pay future duties.  At end of Q4, that was $243 million ([See Page 4 of their 2020 10-k]( https://www.resolutefp.com/uploadedFiles/Investors/Financial_Reports/2020_10-K_Resolute-RFP.pdf?v=1)). That comes to just over $3 of EPS, which is quite significant given that the average analyst projection for net income for the year is $4 EPS\u2026 \n\n**TLDR**: This stock has been kicking ass for a reason and I think will continue to do so.  I can\u2019t predict the future, but I haven\u2019t sold a share yet and will continue to keep a majority of my portfolio in this stock for the next 1-2 quarters *at a minimum,* because of the massive earnings they are/will be generating.  I don\u2019t think the true future earnings of 2021 are priced in yet by analyst PTs or the current stock price.\n\nNote:  I am not a financial advisor/analyst.  Please do your own research and make your own decisions if this company is under or overvalued.  I am sharing my thoughts with you because the mainstream financial media gives dogshit advice on how to invest in lumber.  \n\nI\u2019m long RFP in both shares and long term calls.  Don\u2019t ask me for a PT, I\u2019m not gonna give you one.  Don\u2019t ask me if you should buy it, when you should buy it or when you should sell it.  You have to make those decisions for yourself.",

        "selftext": "$Coin is listing at $250 which is a $65B marketcap.  This will be $350+ before you blink.  On their exchange it was trading a tokenized version for $600 which was approx $150B marketcap.  Realistically anything $350 or beyond is speculation as it\u2019ll be priced beyond perfection.  So how to make money...?\n\nA rising tide lifts all boats.  Two companies in same space are flying under the radar, Bakkt ($v i h) and eToro ($f t c v).  Marketcap are right now $3B and $14b.  \n\nBakkt is fully regulated, majority owned by ICE/NYSE (owns 76%), Steven Cohen owns 5.6%, and has 3.3 million shares short which could trigger a squeeze today through end of week if this gets volume today.  Fully regulated, started by selling futures on b1tcoin, and just launched their retail digital wallet. Who says digital wallets are the future?  Mama Woods: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/cathie-wood-sees-these-2-trends-as-the-next-big-things-after-electric-vehicles.html\n\nEToro is a platform to buy/sell crypt0 and stocks.  It\u2019s focus is in Europe and just expanding into US now.  Their revenue is about 1/3 the size of $Coin but it\u2019s marketcap could be as small as 1/10 of $coin (depends where $coin goes today).  Robinhood wants to ipo at $50B and eToro is same size.  Again a high volume day here as a sympathy play could result in big gains rest of week.  If people don\u2019t want to put $350 into $coin they are going to look for next best thing.  I think a lot of them will land here.  \n\nImo both of these will run today and rest of week.  I would not be surprised at all to see either one double by week\u2019s end.  Glta.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: Not financial advice, I eat crayons.\n\n\nOnce I saw the Canoo trucks on their promotional video I thought there is promise for the modularity of them being good candidates for the new USPS truck. But the USPS truck contract was given to Oshkosh Corporation, right? Well maybe. Turns out someone bought 55 million shares before the contract went public. Speculation: If the SEC finds misconduct will the deal be null and void? The vehicles are not due till 2023. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshkosh_Corporation (I have no idea how government contacts are dealt with)\n\nIf the bid is undone I think there are a couple good reasons they are a valid candidate.\n\n**E.V. low speed efficiencies**\n\nElectric Vehicles have insane gains on energy consumption at low speed. \n\n[Power Consumption Curve for Tesla Model S](https://i.stack.imgur.com/e98Er.png) ([post](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-physics.101931/)). Now I found an [article^1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213624X17300974) that concluded that switching Austin's USPS trucks to diesel trucks would cut down emissions. They used a speed of 15 mhp to run their simulations, note motor vehicles do not get the same energy gains at low speeds as e.v.[1]. I am not gonna even try to factor in the speeding up and down or the real characteristic of the battery pack (there will be energy loss but its Tesla's job to make these batteries as efficient as they can be). The [NEDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S) estimates that full charge of 85 kWh can be discharged in 315 miles. User [Frank99](https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/177605/full-charge-range) found he can ride at around 244 Wh/mi for 40 miles at 70 mph. This took Frank 4/7 h or 0.57 hours.\n \n\nWith a size of 75k Wh for a total battery comes out to 75k Wh / 244 Wh / mi  = 307.38 miles. Pretty close to the NEDC estimation.\n\n307 mi * (0.57 hours / 40 miles) = 4.385h of driving for an entire charge.\n\nTotal Watt hour consumed: 244 Wh/mi * 40 mi = 9.760 kWh\n\nReferring to the first graph the car would be around 300 kW 'consumption' for the majority of the time. The energy spent to hold at that level was 9.760 kWh for 0.57 hours of driving at 70 mph. Now suppose you only need to run to say 15 miles an hour well now you would just need to hold it at 125 kW. Now here's where real research people would know how much of a reduction  in total power consumption this would be. I will guess the reduction (9.760 / 1.5 -&gt; 6.467 kWh) this would 1.5x the range of the Tesla Model S to over 450 miles before a recharge, but you can kinda just plug in value here and then multiple it with 307 to get your new range. I think anything between 1 and 2 is a good estimate because the reduction in the overall energy cost is a little over 2. \n\nNow I could not find information on this but I think a USPS truck travel less than 450 miles a day. \n\nCanoo is probably following Tesla and just letting/following the EPA give their estimated ranges or not even publishing them because so much of the battery life is dependent on the driver's habits.\n\nFor viewing pleasure: https://www. yt .com/watch?v=rbnvZlPZZQc\n\n**Modularity**\n\nA general problem for the U.S. has is finding parts for stuff that is old.\nThe previous USPS fleet truck was designed as Life Long Vehicle and their repair cost went through the roof as time goes on. The USPS even acknowledged this back in 2010 ([pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20100714015726/http://www.uspsoig.gov/foia_files/DA-AR-10-005.pdf)). Per Canoo's promotional video they are focusing on reliability and resell ability.\n\n\n**Replacing other LLV**\n\nThe deal with Oshkosh Corporation was for 50,000 to 165,000 to be produced. In 2010 there were 189,000 LLVs. There could be a cap for 165k LLVs now. Oshkosh could be capped at 50k if the USPS decides to revisit this after the investigation, as I do not think the plan of leaving 90% un-electrified fits with the current party.\n\n\n[1] Tractor and stuff run at pretty low rpm on diesel so there is a chance to get close to e.v. levels of gains with new science but I haven't done the research, but pulling from article^1 the power consumption is 10x greater with their Diesel van than their electric van listed and they just use money. Coal factories as bad as they are way more efficient than car's when it comes to making energy. \n\n\nLooks like the short squeeze is back on if you trust ortex data see /u/brotherluminous for more information.\n\nedit: formatting.

        "selftext": "**tl;dr: PLUG has a history of burning shareholders and customers, does not make an economical product, and the shares are worth much closer to $0 than to $30. If you're thinking of buying shares or calls, don't. If you hold shares or calls, sell them. If you want to make a bet, buy puts.**\n\nIt's July 2000. You've made a decent amount of tendies over the past few years investing in hot tech companies. The markets are down a fair bit from their March highs, but that just means there are more buying opportunities. Maybe you can find the next Microsoft.\n\nYou find a stock that looks promising -- Plug Power. It's down 50% from its 52-week high, but you're sure it's gonna be huge. Green energy is the future. It's got the largest company in the world, General Electric, as an investor. [Bob Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli), the head of GE Power Systems and a contender to succeed Jack Welch, is on the board of directors. And their joint venture with GE just announced a deal to sell 1500 fuel cells to a Saudi Arabian trading company controlled by the royal family. If even the oil kingdom is moving to the hydrogen economy, you want to be a part of it. You're buying.\n\nOver the next few years, you will lose more than 95% of your investment.\n\nWhat happened? Well, there is public documentation on some of this: the Saudi trading company sued Plug and the GE subsidiary that co-owned the joint venture in 2008 for breach of contract and misrepresentation. You can find a summary of the complaint [here](https://casetext.com/case/soroof-trading-development-company-ltd-plaintiff-v-ge-microgen-inc-and-plug-power-inc-defendants), but I'm working from a copy of their First Amended Complaint.\n\nThe complaint alleges that GE and Plug \"understood by February 1999 that [Plug's fuel cells] would never be marketable\" but formed the joint venture (GE Fuel Cell Systems, which I'll call either GEFCS or just \"the JV\" for short) anyway to try and recoup costs. Soroof (the name of the Saudi trading company, but I'll call them \"the guys who financed 9/11\" for long) further alleges that GEFCS was just an empty shell with \"nominal assets consisting of a small amount of furniture, a telephone switch and a computer server\" and an office subleased from Plug. And GEFCS duly extracted $1 million from the guys who financed 9/11 in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute the fuel cells in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSomewhat incredibly, the complaint alleges that Plug and GE then proceeded to jerk around the guys who financed 9/11 for *five years*, telling Soroof over and over again that they were improving the product and it wasn't quite ready yet but it would be soon. Finally, \"In 2005, Soroof expressed its dissatisfaction with [GE and Plug's] complete lack of performance to date\", which you might recognize as the same thing your wife did right before she introduced you to Chad. The JV had effectively been dead for years (or so Soroof claims), but GE and Plug knew to expect a lawsuit, and hurriedly wound up the operation, with PLUG indemnifying GE against the first $1 million in claims arising from GEFCS. Plug [filed an 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000119312506063079/d8k.htm) notifying the markets of the termination of the JV, but they didn't tell the Saudis. And when the Saudis found out in early 2007, they completely lost their shit, and they sure did sue. (As best as I can tell the lawsuit ended up dissolving in a flurry of procedural arguments. I'm not a lawyer and I don't care.)\n\nSo if this complaint was filed by the guys who financed 9/11, why should you believe them? Well, there are other signs that the higher-ups at GE knew pretty quickly that Plug's fuel cells weren't going to be commercially viable. GE had agreed to buy fuel cells from Plug in early 1999 -- but they [couldn't meet specifications](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB957739751789506989) and cancelled the entire contract in spring 2000. Bob Nardelli was [off the board by mid-July 2000](https://eepower.com/news/john-g-rice-assumes-position-on-plug-powers-board-of-directors/), and it's telling that neither his [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobnardelli/) nor [his successor's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-rice-30b651118/?originalSubdomain=hk) nor the [president of the JV](https://biography.omicsonline.org/france/technip/barry-glickman-36852) makes reference to their involvement with Plug or GEFCS. And this also sounds like the MO of General Electric circa 2000, which was, in hindsight, [a bag of shit trading at 50 times earnings](https://philo.substack.com/p/success-theater) propped up by expansion into questionable businesses like long-term care insurance and a whole bunch of accounting gimmicks. That stock is also down more than 80% from its October 2000 high, although at least you got paid a dividend for your trouble.\n\nBut the biggest reason GE should have known early that Plug's fuel cells wouldn't be marketable is basic physics. To get green hydrogen, you need to consume electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen (losing some along the way). Then you need to consume more energy to compress and transport the hydrogen. Then you turn it back into water, electricity and waste heat in a fuel cell. It's much cheaper and more efficient to transmit the energy directly over high-voltage power lines! For some applications -- like the forklifts that Plug promotes today -- there is a last-mile problem to solve, but as I'm sure you've heard, battery technology today is very good, and it's just more economical to use battery power. (I'll have more to say about both the physics and the forklifts in follow-on posts.)\n\nThrough the fiscal years 2001-6, Plug Power produced a cumulative loss of $16 million on $67 million of revenue *before any operating expenses*. Their net loss was much worse. By early 2007, the stock was trading at about where it is today on a split-adjusted basis, and if you bought in July 2000 you were down 95%. It got cut by another 90% before it rallied last year. And today looks a lot like July of 2000: Plug is [partnering with big oil companies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fossil-fuel-mainstay-baker-hughes-joins-plug-power-in-green-hydrogen-fund-11617629145) and [taking sovereign investment money](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921001786/tm211407d2_8k.htm). More worryingly, it's delinquent filing its 10-K for 2020 and is [restating its accounts](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-to-restate-financial-statements-stock-plunges-11615930211) for the last two years, and it posted a [negative gross profit in Q3 2020](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020013381/plug-20200930x10q.htm).

        "selftext": "RIDE: THE COMPLETE DUE DILIGENCE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is my complete Due Diligence on Lordstown Motor Company. I have spent over 100 hours researching this company. Disclosure: I am long RIDE and hold many shares, but I will do my best to be brutally honest about the good, the bad, and the theoretical. Let's begin:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION, ORIGIN, AND BACKGROUND\n\nNOTE: As everything in Chapter 1 is not contested nor controversial, I have not sourced any of the information. After Chapter 1, I will try to provide sources for all information presented.\n\nStarting in 2015, a company called Workhorse began developing electric trucks. By 2018, Workhorse had built and sold 1,000 electric delivery trucks to UPS.  Around then, Workhorse received an order of 500 electric pickup trucks from Duke Energy. The company had a crossroads decision of whether to develop large delivery trucks or smaller pickup trucks. The company decided to focus on large delivery trucks. Then CEO, Steve Burns, decided to open a new company in late 2018 to focus on the pickup trucks. For a brief period, he was CEO of both companies until he stepped down from Workhorse in Feb 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, prior to 2019, the Lordstown, Ohio manufacturing plant was owned by GM and produced cars such as the Chevy Cruze, Cobalt, and Cavalier. It is a 6.2M sqft plant and at its height, produced 1 million cars per year. As those vehicles did not sell well, GM decided late 2018 to shut down the plant. Ohio is a very important political battleground state, and former President Trump promised to keep manufacturing open in Ohio; he threatened GM if they did not find a way to keep the plant open.\n\nGM's solution was to sell the plant to an EV company, Workhorse, however the deal was delayed by the united auto worker's union. Eventually in Nov of 2019, the plant was sold to Steve Burn's pickup truck company.\n\nThe plant was purchased for $40M as a loan underwritten by GM. In addition, GM invested $75M into the pickup truck company which now took the name: Lordstown Motor Company, which will be abbreviated as LMC for the rest of this write-up. Workhorse owns 10% of LMC, but in exchange, LMC has the right to use all technology developed while Steve Burns was at Workhorse. \n\nBy June of 2020, LMC unveiled its working prototype pickup truck: the Endurance. The Endurance is unique from other electric vehicles because it uses hub motors as the drive system reducing the number of moving parts which should increase the reliability.\n\nThen in October of 2020, LMC completed a reverse merger. This merger raised $675M for LMC which now trades under the symbol RIDE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 2: THE HINDENBURG REPORT\n\nSince going public, RIDE had been trading between $20-$30 per share in the last three months. CEO Steve Burns had been making the rounds with interviews on CNBC and FOX Business. On those shows, he made the claims of having 100,000 preorders and production date to begin in September 2021.\n\nIn early March 2021, a company named Hindenburg Research began shorting RIDE, and on March 12th, 2021, they released their article about LMC. The entire article can be found here: [https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/)\n\nHindenburg famously shorted and exposed another EV company, NKLA for claiming to have a working prototype when in reality, NKLA rolled a non-driving truck downhill.\n\nSummary of the CLAIMS by Hindenburg against LMC\n\n1) LMC does not really have 100,000 preorders. Those numbers are all non-binding letters of intent. Many of those letters are coming from people/companies that definitely do not have the means to buy that many trucks. LMC did not take deposits for these preorders. Furthermore, LMC paid commissions to get these \"fake\" preorders.\n\n2) Insiders of LMC have sold shares to pocket $28M.\n\n3) An early prototype of the Endurance truck spontaneously burst into flames in Jan of 2021.\n\n4) Steve Burns claimed that LMC was going to make batteries in house, but will not be able to.\n\n5) An unnamed source claimed LMC licensed the Hub Motor technology from a Slovenian company (Elaphe), not because it is good technology, but because it allowed them to save money.\n\n6) Hub Motor technology is unproven.\n\n7) An unnamed source claimed that the actual orders from Duke Energy and Ryder were not serious orders.\n\n8) An unnamed source claimed to be a former employee says LMC is 3-4 years out from production.\n\n9) An unnamed source claimed that Steve Burns was pushed out as CEO by Workhorse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCounter Arguments to Hindenburg's Claims\n\n1) All EV companies take non-binding preorders for their cars. Since Feb, preordering an Endurance does require a deposit of $100\n\n[https://lordstownmotors.com/25432293427/checkouts/2481b3672ab9a214b93bcd835468f0be](https://lordstownmotors.com/25432293427/checkouts/2481b3672ab9a214b93bcd835468f0be)\n\nHowever, the heart of this argument boils down to whether or not there will be demand.\n\nConsider the following\n\n\\- The top 3 selling cars in USA are pickup trucks (Ford F, Silverado, Ram)\n\n\\- 5 out of 10 of the best selling cars in the USA are pickups\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/pickup-trucks-dominate-americas-10-best-selling-vehicles-of-2020.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/pickup-trucks-dominate-americas-10-best-selling-vehicles-of-2020.html)\n\n\\- During the pandemic 2020, pickup trucks sold over 3 million trucks.\n\n[https://tfltruck.com/2021/01/2020-sales-report-news/](https://tfltruck.com/2021/01/2020-sales-report-news/)\n\n\\- The Endurance is faster, stronger, most likely more reliable, AND CHEAPER to own than ICE trucks. I think it is pretty obvious that there will be demand. The risk of investing in RIDE will not be the demand; it will be the production. If the Endurance is a well built reliable truck, it will sell.\n\n2) I have saved this topic of insider trading for Chapter 3.\n\n3) Prototype bursting into flames is also true, however, whether we are talking about any Tesla car, Kia Niro, Hyundai Kona, Chevy Bolt, to my knowledge, every single electric car has had an instance of spontaneous combustion. It all has to do with flawed battery packs or flawed battery assembly. It should be noted that Tesla has had many cases of spontaneously catching fire, but it argued, citing government data, that their EV's are 10 times less likely to catch fire than a gas car.\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/28/tesla-battery-fire/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/28/tesla-battery-fire/)\n\nIn the case of the Endurance prototype, it was a flaw in the hand assembly. However battery technology and the battery management computer programing is constantly getting better. This instance was a single hand made Endurance. Moving forward, they will be using LG Chem batteries.\n\n[https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108\\_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup)\n\n4) Yes, Burns originally stated they were going to make batteries in-house, but for the time being moving forward, they will be using LG Chem batteries.\n\nNOTE: LG Chem makes batteries for Tesla, but controversially, they have had to recently recall the batteries they make for the Hyundai Kona and Chevy Bolt.\n\n[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34672772/chevrolet-bolt-ev-recall-battery/#:\\~:text=Chevrolet%20is%20recalling%20more%20than,LG%20Chem%20in%20South%20Korea](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34672772/chevrolet-bolt-ev-recall-battery/#:~:text=Chevrolet%20is%20recalling%20more%20than,LG%20Chem%20in%20South%20Korea).\n\n[https://thedriven.io/2020/11/17/hyundai-turns-to-sk-innovation-batteries-instead-of-lg-chem-in-light-of-kona-ev-battery-fires/](https://thedriven.io/2020/11/17/hyundai-turns-to-sk-innovation-batteries-instead-of-lg-chem-in-light-of-kona-ev-battery-fires/)\n\nStill, LG Chem is a large reliable and safe company to partner up with. The solution to the recalls was to not charge the car to 100%. Many EV's now come with this restriction built in. When you charge the car to \"100%\" showing on your dashboard, you've only actually charged it to 80%-90%. The cars save some buffer room and literally do not allow you to charge to the actual 100%.\n\n5 and 6) Hub motor technology has actually been around since 1900. Many commuter busses use this technology. The main negative of Hub motor technology is unsprung mass. You can read about it here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsprung\\_mass#:\\~:text=The%20unsprung%20mass%20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsprung_mass#:~:text=The%20unsprung%20mass%20)(colloquially%20unsprung,components%20directly%20connected%20to%20them.&amp;text=Brakes%20that%20are%20mounted%20inboard,of%20a%20vehicle's%20sprung%20mass.\n\nThe weird thing about this claim is that current electric motor technology is very simple, hence the reliability. Tesla has opened their patents for anyone to use since 2014. \n\n[https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you](https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you)\n\nIt doesn't make sense to go pay another company for electric motor technology unless that technology really was better than the current electric motor technology. I will discuss the Baja San Felipe 250 race in a later chapter, however, it should be fair to say that the hub motor has been proven to be effective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7,8,9) The problem with these claims of un-named ex-employee sources is that there is no way to verify the validity of these claims. The claims could be true, but they could all be made up. We do  not have any way of proving it one way or another. The best lies are the ones that are sprinkled in between truths. Hindenburg Research is not a news company, and therefore is not held to journalist standards. At the bottom of their own article they even make the disclaimer: \n\n\"However, such information is presented \u201cas is,\u201d without warranty of any kind \u2013 whether express or implied. Hindenburg Research makes no representation, express or implied, as to the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of any such information or with regard to the results to be obtained from its use. All expressions of opinion are subject to change without notice...\"\n\nThey literally have a disclaimer of, we might or might not be telling the truth!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 3: INSIDER TRADING AND THE SEC INVESTIGATION\n\nThe SEC is currently investigating LMC for fraudulent statements by Burns and insider trading.\n\n\\- The investigation of fraudulent statements is regarding the 100,000 preorders. You can watch the interviews online. This thread won't let me link the videos. Search MSNBC and Lordstown. \n\n[https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of the Insider Trading: here is the list:\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ride/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ride/insider-activity)\n\nSeems like insiders sold a lot of shares right? Well, let's look big picture:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRichard Schmidt (President): Executed Option 200k shares and sold 211,512 shares\n\nOverall, he was awarded 875,367 shares and sold 263,412 shares.

He still owns 228,526 shares.\n\n[https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1827681.htm](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1827681.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShane Brown (Chief Production Officer): Executed option of 19,008 shares and sold 19,008 shares\n\nOverall, he was awarded 56,281 shares, and sold 19,008 shares. He still owns 37,273 shares. (Seems low, not sure if this was filed correctly).\n\n[https://sec.report/CIK/0001833107/Insider-Trades](https://sec.report/CIK/0001833107/Insider-Trades)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJulio Rodriguez (Chief Financial Officer): Sold 9k shares\n\nOverall, he was awarded 933,697, and sold 9,000 shares. I don't know why he currently owns 870,725 shares instead of 924,697... but, regardless, he is holding a lot of shares still.\n\n[https://sec.report/CIK/0001585843/Insider-Trades](https://sec.report/CIK/0001585843/Insider-Trades)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChaun Vo (VP of Propulsion): Sold 198.3k shares\n\nOverall, he was awarded 437,543 shares, and sold 198,300 shares. He still owns 239,243 shares.\n\n[https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1827679.htm](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1827679.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, yes, a lot of shares were sold, but looking at the numbers they are still holding, does this look like they are selling out and abandoning ship, or does it look like they're cashing out a portion of their stocks for the first time so they can buy a nice house?\n\nManagement positions of the above officers:\n\n[https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 4: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n[https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020)\n\nHighlights:\n\n\\- Spent $101M in 2020. \n\n\\- Expects to spend $275M in 2021.\n\n\\- Had $630M cash on hand to start 2021, but also gained $82M from warrant exercising options, so should have $712M cash on hand.\n\n\\- Total liabilities $34M (the amount they still owe GM for the plant).\n\nConclusion: there's no way they're going bankrupt before they get the product out\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 5: STOCK LOCK-UP &amp; DILUTION\n\n1) WKHS' 10% and GM's estimated 7.5%-10% is locked up until April 23rd, 2021. I highly doubt they would sell at the current price.\n\n2) Steve Burns' has 25% ownership. Half of this (12.5%) is locked up until October 23rd, 2021. The other half (12.5%) is locked up until October 23rd, 2022.\n\n3) RIDE has authorized awards of 300M shares for a total of 468M shares. Currently, the shares outstanding is 176.58M shares. That means over time, your 1 share can be diluted to be worth .3773 shares. This is obviously a very big dilution, but it is simply how many startups work. They pay employees in stock for meeting targeted goals. I discuss how to put valuation to your shares in the face of being diluted in Chapter 10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 6: THE BETA TRUCKS\n\nAfter releasing the 2020 full year report in Mid March, CEO Burns stated that the betas would be out by the end of March, and they were going to be producing 1 beta per day.\n\nOn March 31st, after the market closed, they revealed 2 beta trucks. EB-01-21 and EB-02-21. This is most likely code for: Endurance Beta - #01 &amp; #02 - 2021. \n\nThough not officially released, we also saw a picture for a 3rd truck that day: [https://i.redd.it/ynbllt3l5iq61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/ynbllt3l5iq61.jpg)\n\nSince then, LMC has officially released photos for 5 trucks. \n\n[https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/beta-counter](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/beta-counter)\n\nThe positive was that LMC was able to meet the deadline set by Burns of March 31st for the Betas. The risk is that exists right now is that by now, we should have around 20 Beta trucks, yet we've only seen 5-7 trucks in photos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 7: THE BAJA RACE\n\nSteve Burns has long touted that the Endurance will join the Baja 250 race on April 17th, 2021 as a test of the truck. He clearly stated that their goal was to finish the race. The truck ran out of battery after mile 38 and had to be towed to charge. After fully charging, it began driving a very confusing route all captured on GPS by the race officials.\n\n[https://www.race-dezert.com/home/2021-score-san-felipe-250-live-stream-tracking-updates-209786.html](https://www.race-dezert.com/home/2021-score-san-felipe-250-live-stream-tracking-updates-209786.html)\n\nLook at E414 route.\n\nI think this thread theorizes what happened better than I can explain it, so just go read, BUT NOTE: THIS IS UNCONFIRMED:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/mt6nmc/heres\\_what\\_happened\\_in\\_baja/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/mt6nmc/heres_what_happened_in_baja/)\n\nThis thread tries to explain the 38 miles. ALSO UNCONFIRMED:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/mtetge/endurance\\_40mile\\_battery\\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/mtetge/endurance_40mile_battery_story/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTakeaways from Baja, The Bad:\n\n\\- Baja opened the track for trial runs April 2nd. Though Burns had made the claim about Baja since 2020, they did not complete the truck until 4/15/21, which means they were unable to trial run the course.\n\n\\- If they had done a trial run, they would've realized that in deep sand, their battery only goes 38-40 miles. Then they could've set something up like a charging truck to drive along the Endurance or set up charging stations every 30 or so miles. Instead, the truck had to bow out early in an embarrassing fashion.\n\n\\- Afterwards, LMC posted a statement congratulating themselves on a successful day. This was not a good statement. People are not so stupid that they can't see a fake congragulation trying to pretend a failure is actually a success. They should have admitted that the day did not go well. They were disappointed not to finish, and they vow to do better.\n\n\\- This shows signs of being behind schedule and a terrible PR department.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTakeaways from Baja, The Good:\n\n\\- The durability of the truck held up well.\n\n\\- The Hub motor technology has been proven to be effective. This is probably the single most important takeaway. They can be behind schedule; they can have poor PR, but their technology has to work, and it did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 8: THOUGHTS ON STEVE BURNS, THE CEO\n\nAccording to Warren Buffet, judging the CEO and the company management is one of the most important things that is often overlooked. So, let's examine the pros and cons of Steve Burns.\n\n1) Vision: The vision for this company is simple: EV trucks and vans. It's a good goal, enough said.\n\n2) PR Department: Prior to March, many people discussed how they like Burns as a calm, well spoken CEO that is a very big contrast to Elon Musk. After the Hindenburg report, everyone seemed to hate his interviews. I think it is clear that he is very good in friendly interviews, but does very poorly when facing hostile questioning. PR when facing negativity is definitely a weakness of his.\n\n3) Day to day interaction and motivation of employees: I really have no info about his abilities here.\n\n4) Ability to hire the right people: Also another category I don't have much information about.\n\n5) Deal making abilities: This is probably his biggest strength. \n\n\\- At WKHS he made deals with UPS and DUK\n\n\\- He was able to secure the GM deal to purchase the factory for pennies on the dollar (which is equivalent to Tesla's purchase of the Fremont Factory).\n\n\\- He also convinced GM to invest $75M, WKHS to give him all the tech they've developed.\n\n\\- He got former President Trump, Tim Ryan, Joe Burrow, Marcus Lemonis, Guy Fieri to endorse him and ally with LMC. I don't care if you're Democrat or Republican, it's good to have a CEO who can rub elbows with the rich and powerful.\n\n6) Managing expectations: I think it's clear that Burns has the same problem of over promising just like Elon Musk. The argument for this method is: setting unattainable goals will push your company to do more than if you set realistic goals that they can meet. I think it can be good to manage this way, but as investors, we have to take all their words and lower our expectations. Just like Tesla is a great company, but it has been promising full self-driving with no intervention since 2017. I believe anyone who invests in RIDE needs to prepare themselves for production not starting in September, but maybe by early 2022.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 9: THE SHORT ATTACK\n\nThere are currently two narratives as to why the price of RIDE has dropped so hard.\n\nNarrative 1: LMC is a fraudulent company that was exposed by Hindenburg. With a myriad of lawsuits and investigation for fraud, investors lost confidence and massively sold their shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNarrative 2: LMC is a vulnerable company under a short attack by a group of hedge funds with the intentions of making profits on the short sale side by sinking the stock, and then eventually buying in for cheap on the long. This play is most likely led by Hindenburg and Morgan Stanely's Adam Jonas.\n\nWhen the market price of RIDE was $30, he set the price target to $18\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDays after the Hindenburg Report,when the market price was $15, he lowered the price target to $12\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-ride-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-03/#:\\~:text=MarketBeat%20Podcast-,Lordstown%20Motors%20(NASDAQ%3ARIDE)%20Price%20Target%20Lowered,to%20%2412.00%20at%20Morgan%20Stanley&amp;text=They%20set%20a%20%22buy%22%20rating%20and%20a%20%2435.00,price%20target%20for%20the%20company](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-ride-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-03/#:~:text=MarketBeat%20Podcast-,Lordstown%20Motors%20(NASDAQ%3ARIDE)%20Price%20Target%20Lowered,to%20%2412.00%20at%20Morgan%20Stanley&amp;text=They%20set%20a%20%22buy%22%20rating%20and%20a%20%2435.00,price%20target%20for%20the%20company).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the same Adam Jonas that claimed Tesla could fall to $10 pre-split in 2019\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html)\n\nFor those who don't remember: Tesla was trading around $350 pre split in late 2018, when it came under financial pressure and a short attack dropping the price to $180 pre split mid 2019. Later, it was disclosed that many of the firms that were spreading FUD about TSLA in mid 2019, including Morgan Stanley, ended up buying massive shares and going long. Now, Morgan Stanely, despite the astronomical gains and current valuations, is today, constantly pumping TSLA.\n\n[https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/11/adam-jonas-of-morgan-stanley-tesla-tsla-is-a-must-own-but-what-about-legacy-auto/](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/11/adam-jonas-of-morgan-stanley-tesla-tsla-is-a-must-own-but-what-about-legacy-auto/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWant proof?

Typical short selling requires borrowing shares to sell short. FTD HAPPENS WHEN ALL THE SHARES HAVE BEEN BORROWED AND THEY ARE STILL SHORT SELLING BEYOND WHAT THEY CAN BORROW. They had Failure to Deliver EVERY SINGLE DAY in the second half of March.\n\nGo look at Fintel, Fidelity, or whatever brokerage you use. You will find that the shares available to borrow to short RIDE are all gone. THIS STOCK IS BEING SHORT SOLD TO THE GROUND.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll sane humans have a strong psychological reaction towards loss aversion. (Read Prospect Theory by noble winning behavior economists: Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman). Here is a quick summary link: [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-loss-aversion/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-loss-aversion/)\n\nAs an investor, watching your account lose money is literally a form of mental torture. [https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/70374172.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/70374172.pdf)\n\nWhat an investor must understand about a short attack is that there are two clashing forces. The short attackers must withstand an ongoing interest payment for their short sales. The retail investor must withstand the ongoing metal torture from seeing losses in their portfolios. Whichever side breaks first will lose.\n\nThe more FUD the shorts put out there, the more retail investors will give up and sell at lower prices. The longer they keep the price subdued, the more it affects everyone's perception of the actual price of the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOTHER THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT THE SHORT SELLING ENVIRONMENT:\n\nStarting 4/22/21 SEC will be enforcing a Rule Change\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/staff-fully-paid-lending](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/staff-fully-paid-lending)\n\nWhat this means: Hedge fund A wants to short a stock. They execute their trade through a Bank A. The Bank brings the trade to the clearing house.\n\nStarting 4/22/21, the Bank must also provide cash to the clearing house for this trade to ensure that if Hedge fund A and Bank A go bankrupt, the shares can still be bought back and closed out.\n\nWe know Archegos used Credit Suisse, Nomura, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs to margin long and possibly short stocks. When Archegos could not meet their margin call, the four Banks began to liquidate, and Credit Suisse and Nomura at least are taking a major loss.\n\nNow, Archegos was leveraged 8 to 1, which apparently almost all the hedge funds are. If these failures of margin calls get numerous and massive enough, it could potentially cause a bank to go bankrupt. The law being changed is designed, so that in the event that the bank goes bankrupt, these shorts can still be unwound.\n\nWhat this means for the Banks. Banks actually like their short selling and margin long clients because the Banks make a lot of interest off these clients. However, this change in the rules will begin to tie up cash and require Banks to hold a lot more cash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWonder why JPM and BAC just reported amazing quarters of profit and then last week issued $13 billion and $15 billion in bonds? It probably has to do with this rule being implemented.\n\n[https://news.yahoo.com/bank-america-set-record-largest-181313888.html](https://news.yahoo.com/bank-america-set-record-largest-181313888.html)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/jpmorgan-sell-13-billion-bonds-184602000.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/jpmorgan-sell-13-billion-bonds-184602000.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat this means for short sellers. Because the banks had to issue these bonds to prepare to meet these requirements, you can bet that the interest rate for short sellers is going to go up significantly. The interest prior to these rules was around 1%-2% according to Fintel. The banks issue their bonds around 4%-5%, which means that short sellers will have to begin paying 5%-7% on their short positions. This will obviously put significantly more pressure on short sellers to close out their positions, but it isn't exactly overnight forced to liquidate. Still, this means that the prolonged shorting of a company will be much harder to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 10: THEORETICAL VALUE WITHOUT SHORTS OR HYPE\n\nThere are several ways to evaluate the price of a stock:\n\n1) Moving Averages and technical analysis are not my thing. Sorry.\n\n2) If you look at other research firms, they give RIDE:\n\n\\- Goldman Sachs: $31\n\n\\- RF Lafferty: $35\n\n\\- WOLFE: $27\n\n\\- BTIG: $40\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-ride-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-03/#:\\~:text=The%20Goldman%20Sachs%20Group%20began,target%20price%20for%20the%20company.&amp;text=They%20issued%20a%20%22sell%22%20rating,target%20price%20for%20the%20company](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-ride-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-03/#:~:text=The%20Goldman%20Sachs%20Group%20began,target%20price%20for%20the%20company.&amp;text=They%20issued%20a%20%22sell%22%20rating,target%20price%20for%20the%20company).\n\nBut they can be dishonest and we don't know how they came to those numbers.\n\n3) SO... let's do some theorycrafting! \\~Yay\\~\n\nI will be presenting valuations based on the method: projected future profit of this company discounted to present value at 10% compounding interest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMATH Pt 1: Profit per car sold. \n\n\\- The Endurance truck is based off of the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra 1500\n\n[https://www.caranddriver.com/lordstown/endurance](https://www.caranddriver.com/lordstown/endurance)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra make at least $17,000 PROFIT (Revenue - Parts - Labor - Dealership Holdback) per vehicle higher/middle end trucks.\n\n[https://gmauthority.com/blog/gm/chevrolet/silverado/2019-chevrolet-silverado/](https://gmauthority.com/blog/gm/chevrolet/silverado/2019-chevrolet-silverado/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The MSRP on the Silverado and Sierra are $35,000\n\n[https://www.chevrolet.com/trucks/silverado/1500](https://www.chevrolet.com/trucks/silverado/1500)\n\n[https://www.gmc.com/trucks/sierra/1500/sle-elevation-slt/build-and-price/config](https://www.gmc.com/trucks/sierra/1500/sle-elevation-slt/build-and-price/config)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Dealership Holdback is 3% for GM trucks\n\n[https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/how-much-does-a-new-car-dealer-make-on-a-deal/](https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/how-much-does-a-new-car-dealer-make-on-a-deal/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSO: $35,000 revenue - 17000 profit - $900 Dealership Hold Back = $17,100 cost of parts and labor to produce the truck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Next we have to add the cost of the battery for the Endurance: 109kWH costing $137/kWh should cost $15,000\n\n[https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-cited-below-100-kwh-for-the-first-time-in-2020-while-market-average-sits-at-137-kwh/](https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-cited-below-100-kwh-for-the-first-time-in-2020-while-market-average-sits-at-137-kwh/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Extra conservative estimate - Obviously LMC will not be producing trucks as efficiently as GM, and while LMC will not have to pay for a combustion engine, they do have to pay for 4 Hub Motors. For this reason, I will be conservative and estimate that it will cost an additional $10,000 per truck to produce in the first 5 years until LMC scales up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- No, let's be extra, extra conservative - Let's throw in another $5000 per car of unexpected unknown costs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProfit per Endurance sold in the first 5 years: $52500 - $17,100 - $15,000 - $10,000 - $5,000= $5,400 + Emission Credits\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow much are these emission credits worth? Well in q1 of 2020, TSLA made $428M off emission credits off 90,700 cars sold, so they are probably worth about $4718 per car.\n\n[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a32346670/other-automakers-paid-tesla-record-354-million/](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a32346670/other-automakers-paid-tesla-record-354-million/)\n\nHowever, GM has the right to buy the emissions credits off of LMC for the first 3 years at 75% the market price, or $3538 per car.\n\n[https://jalopnik.com/lordstown-motors-just-showed-one-reason-gm-was-surprisi-1846555417](https://jalopnik.com/lordstown-motors-just-showed-one-reason-gm-was-surprisi-1846555417)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n25 year forecast of profits per vehicle.\n\nYear 2022-2023: $10,400 + $3,538 = $8,938 per vehicle\n\nBoth Bidden and Republicans are on board with emission credits, so no matter who wins the 2024 election, emission credits should continue until 2028. After the first 3 years, they should return to market value of $4718.\n\nAfter 3 years, the cost per KWH battery should be bellow $100, lowering the cost of the battery to $11,000\n\nYear 2024-2028: $52500 - $17,100 - $11,000 - $10,000 + $4718 = $14,118\n\nSince many states are mandating no ICE cars sold after 2030, it is unreliable to estimate emission credits after 2028. However, by 2029, LMC certainly will have increased their production of scale, lowering production costs, so I will remove my conservative extra $10,000 cost.\n\nYear 2029-2045: $52500 - $17,100 - $11,000  = $19,400\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMATH Pt 2: Estimating Yearly Production\n\nWe will look at 4 cases for this model:\n\n\\- Case 1 (Bull Case): LMC produces 6,000 cars in 2021, then 60,000 cars in 2022, and eventually ramping up to 600,000 cars per year.\n\n\\- Case 2 (Bear Case): LMC struggles to scale up similar to how Tesla scaled up. I know what you're thinking, \"Are you crazy?! TSLA's scale up is a massive success. There's no way LMC has better engineers and production team than TSLA.\" \n\nI completely agree, hoping LMC becomes better than TSLA at production is not realistic, BUT keep in mind. \n\nTSLA had to: Develop a nonworking factory at Fremont, develop their own vehicle design, develop electric motors, develop battery technology, develop 3 different cars - including falcon wing doors, develop self driving AI, develop solar panel technology, develop their own media and user interface, develop their own computer chip for self driving AI, build GigaFactory Nevada, and Shanghai, all while the CEO was also developing reusable rockets, selling flamethrowers that are not flamethrowers, and digging underground tunnels for Las Vegas and Los Angeles.\n\nMeanwhile LMC has to: Retool their working factory, purchase truck parts from GM suppliers, purchase batteries from LG Chem, purchase Hub Motors from Elaphe, purchase computer chips and software from GM, and then slap it all together. Then they'll do it all again with Camping World's Vans for round 2.\n\nTesla had to face and overcome monumental challenges. Considering that LMC is tackling much fewer projects, I'm pretty confident that LMC will ramp up production faster than 2012 - 2018 Tesla.\n\nFor this bear case, I actually used the exact production numbers of TSLA from 2012-2020.\n\n\\- Case 3 (Hindenburg Case): This scenario will model zero production for 3 years and a ramp of the bear case 2 afterwards.\n\n\\- Case 4 (Ultimate bear case): LMC never produces a single truck for sale. JK, I'm not going to model this... the answer in this case is ZERO, DUH! If you truly thought this was the scenario, why the hell would you still be reading?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMATH Pt 3: Discounting Time Value of Money\n\nSince the SP500 seems to compound at 10% annually, we must take into consideration the opportunity cost of this 10% annual return.\n\nPresent Value = PV\n\nNumber of Years = Y\n\nFuture Value = FV\n\nSO\n\nPV\\*(1+10%)\\^Y = FV\n\nOR\n\nPV = FV/(1.10\\^Y)\n\nThis number will be found on the furthest left side of the table\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMATH Pt 4: Putting it all Together\n\nAdding the profit of the company discounted by the Time Value of 10% compounding should give us the total Market Cap. Then we assume full dilution of the 465M shares to give us a Price per share.\n\nHere are the results:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XKywmalHD7XxRZX\\_u5nI79GdF4ePxNcCKItGsdh2bv8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XKywmalHD7XxRZX_u5nI79GdF4ePxNcCKItGsdh2bv8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, EVEN in the worst case scenario they are 3 years out from production, we STILL have massive upside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 11: COMPARING RIDE TO OTHER CAR COMPANIES\n\nTSLA: The king of the EV futures: MKT Cap $685.94 B\n\nVolkswagen: A major player of European EV futures: MKT CAP - $96.7B\n\nBYD: A major player in China's EV futures: MKT CAP - $92.7B\n\nNIO: Really, another start-up. Now has a 696,960 sqft factory in Hefei. Their goal is to  produce 90,000 cars this year from that factory. All their previous cars were actually produced by JAC Motors and were sold at a lost for each car. MKT CAP  $60.26B\n\nGM: Big Brother or Big Sister ally. MKT CAP: $83.40B\n\nRIVIAN: The main competition. Has 2.6M Sqft factory in Illinois. Can be first to market with $69,000 truck June 2021.  Estimated MKT CAP to soon be: $50B\n\nFORD: The Big Brother to Rivian: Mkt Cap: $47.48B\n\nLucid Motors: Another start-up EV sedan with a factory in Arizona. Nothing against them or Arizona, but I think selling a $69,000 sedan to compete with Tesla S is the wrong direction: Mkt Cap: $5.06B\n\nNKLA: That actual fraud company that actually rolled a truck downhill and told investors it was a working prototype. Mkt Cap: $4.03B\n\nCanoo: The EV company that wants to make passenger vans that you cannot buy, but can only rent. With no factories and no partnerships. Mkt Cap: $1.97B\n\nRIDE: This EV Truck company with a 6.2M Sqft factory. $712M Cash on Hand. $34M Debt. Has working Beta trucks, partnerships with GM, Camping World, LG Chem. Will probably be second or third to market with $52,500 pickup truck. They are selling an Endurance that is less expensive than the Rivian truck and more traditional looking than the Cyber Truck. Mkt Cap: $1.62B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe End. Thank you for reading.",

Both would need premium technology to justify their high prices and brand images), as the following suggests: \n\n\"Lucid has been \u201capproached by a few car companies this year\u201d over licensing deals, Rawlinson told the Guardian. Those talks have yielded \u201cnothing tangible\u201d yet (...) **However, there is \u201cmouthwatering potential\u201d, and the right partner could yield an affordable electric car within four years, he says.**\" (source 3) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Speculation 2: Lucid might sneak in and give Toyota a better deal than Tesla** \n\n \"A deal with carmakers such as Honda, Hyundai or Toyota (named by Rawlinson) would be the \u201cicing on the cake\u201d\" (source 3) \n\nMost likely candidates here would be Toyota and Hyundai (Honda is already in a committed partnership with GM for their Ultium platform). Toyota is known to have neglected EVs for a long time (and focused on hydrogen instead; thus their EV tech is likely very far behind). The recent Toyota-Tesla partnership rumors with Tesla providing the tech (source 4)  backs this hypothesis. Here, Lucid could sneak in and give Toyota a better deal than Tesla. If Toyota wants to be a real competitor with Tesla, it also would make sense to **partner with a no-name and small company such as Lucid**, if they can get better terms. \n\nAlso, Hyundai doesn't have competitive EV tech.

I am not affiliated with anyone in Goldspot Discoveries, this is not financial advice, I just like the stock for real. \n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis will be my first DD so please be gentle. Also, Thanks to  [u/vrweensy](https://www.reddit.com/user/vrweensy/), who made an exhaustingly great DD a month ago, which I am simply updating after earnings being released last week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis stock is a very promising **AI (Artificial Intelligence) Stock** by the name of **Goldspot Discoveries**. They use Machine Learning (subset of AI) to find **\u201cGold Spots\u201d**.  This technology is planned for eventually being applied to other metals, but right now their money maker is gold. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**:  \n\n* Goldspot Discoveries helps gold mining companies to **find gold via their machine learning/data science software**. They have experts such as former geologists and machine learning experts in their team. This gives them the edge over other machine learning companies of combining the sector expertise with ML for an \"all-included\" solution.\n* **They have been profitable since June 2020**. They have net assets worth 22M$ and revenue growth averaging &gt;100% per year for the last 4 years. This might be the only nanocap penny stock with great fundamentals/financials. Their money printing machine has been turned on. \n* Watch this video for a very good introduction (by the CEO of Goldspot Discoveries):[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyZSLuM0AoE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyZSLuM0AoE)\n* This is not a \"quick buck trade\" catalyst-centered DD. This is an undervalued company I believe is set for great things ahead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **EXTENDED VERSION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPros: \n\n*  **Goldspot Discoveries is already profitable** (since June 2020). They\u2019re not relying on investments or debt. Revenue growing 126% in the last year.  They have a cash reserve of 22 million, which is HUGE considering their market cap is only 46 million. You can compare it to any other company, they have way less cash. They managed to achieve this within 4 years. ([https://www.seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDDCF/profitability](https://www.seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDDCF/profitability)) \n\n*Processing img trpybo6368t61...*\n\n*  AI market is to **grow by 15 trillion $** by the year 2030. That\u2019s more than the Gold market cap of 10 trillion $. ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=684b6b991852](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=684b6b991852)) \n*  **They have almost no debt** (280k$, a laughable amount), meaning they are not reliant on investors money or other kinds of operating cash flow coverage. Other companies at this size or even way larger companies are far away from profitability and debt-freeness. This means that the company doesn't need to dilute shares to stay in business. \n*  **They have multiple monetization strategies.** They make money through consulting mining firms,royalties from companies they have partnered with and they invest their cash into assets with a machine learning software they have developed themselves. (assets allocation:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGal9bxw7L8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGal9bxw7L8)) . \n* **What is their differentiator?** GoldSpot is a consulting company at its core. GoldSpot provides decision-support as a full package, the partner doesn't seem to have any expectation to interact with the ML. I think this is the right approach in this domain, since the barrier to entry for most companies is going to be building an internal team and GoldSpot provides that completely and seem willing and able to be flexible to their partners needs.\n*  They improve the success rate of gold mining firms. Imagine this. You\u2019re leading a project and you\u2019re trying to find out where to dig for gold. Chances you find gold are very low. Then you hire Goldspot Discoveries which help you **improve these chances** by 4-5x. You wouldn\u2019t have to waste money on digging up dirt - at least not as much anymore. Also it is **environmental friendly** since less machine work is needed if the success rate is higher. \n* To go with the previous point, they accept payment through royalties or shares from junior mining companies they work for. Basically, if they find gold for a company, instead of taking a single payment, they can opt for a steady income stream which they **know** will benefit them, since they analyzed the geological data themselves. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z23qhc3608t61.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91460743300033c694267a143b308ecfa85d657f\n\n*  Compared to other small AI Stocks: Better **PE Ratio** (4.5x), Better PB Ratio (2.54x), quarterly revenue growth is higher, High Return of equity ( **80.61%** ) Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement look better. Overall statistics are great. and this company is growing at a fast pace. \n* Their technology is easily usable/transferable to other resources (copper, lithium, nickel ..) as well. The Electrical Vehicle industry might benefit from more efficient mining as well in regards to the production of batteries for the cars.\n* They have worked with Vale Canada, a subsidiary of one of the Top 10 Mining companies in the world. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-10-24/goldspot-discoveries-and-vale-to-use-artificial-intelligence-at-coleman-mine](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-10-24/goldspot-discoveries-and-vale-to-use-artificial-intelligence-at-coleman-mine))\n* **How much gold is left to find on planet earth?** Most gold was found in China, Australia and South Africa - around 244,000 metric tons of gold. Around 2 Trillion worth of gold every 10 years is expected to be mined. (sauce:[ https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-much-gold-has-been-found-world?qt-news\\_science\\_products=0#qt-news\\_science\\_products](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-much-gold-has-been-found-world?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products) )\n* Every year 176 billion USD worth of gold is mined, adding to the \\~ 10 trillion that already exist. Meaning in 10 years the market cap of gold would be around worth 12 trillion USD. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54230737](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54230737))\n* **Gold will stay relevant**, living side by side to Bitcoin. Why? Humanity has been mining Gold for around 5000 years. What are the chances that it is gonna stay around for the next 50-100 years? Pretty high chances I\u2019d say (source:[ https://geology.com/usgs/gold](https://geology.com/usgs/gold/))\n* It\u2019s only available on Toronto Stock Exchange which makes it a bit harder to acquire. In this environment of only Pump and Dumps, this stock has remained hidden for now, adding crazy value with relatively small price movement. \n* Shares float is only 78.64 million. This company hasn't seen its shares get diluted like crazy in the past and it's unlikely to happen. \n* Insiders have been piling up shares. Last years, insiders owned 7.5M$ worth of equity, now they own 18,3M$, more than doubling. Yahoo finance indicates 43.5% of shares are held by insiders. This means they believe strongly in the product. \n* The CEO was a geologist before starting Goldspot Discoveries. (very interesting speech from the CEO, 7 minutes long:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyZSLuM0AoE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyZSLuM0AoE))\n* Highly competent team made of mostly M.Sc and Ph.D. Their CTO has over 11 publications in the field.\n* It\u2019s not on Stocktwits or finviz.com yet. Which generally I would say is a negative thing (that\u2019s why I will list it under \u201ccons\u201d as well). But in this case I actually think it\u2019s good because we\u2019re coming from a huge Pump and Dump phase and I do like that there is not much exposure yet.\n\n \n\n**Cons**\n\n* I don\u2019t know who managed the Stock Ticker name of Goldspot, but it has **multiple stock ticker names**: V.SPOT, SPOT.V, GDDCF. Which is a bit confusing, but they\u2019re all the same. G.SPOT would\u2019ve been so much easier.\n* **Small Market Cap and less discoverability**.\n* Highly dependable on their **success rate of discovering Gold occurrences** and other resources. ([ https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GDDCF/key-statistics?p=GDDCF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GDDCF/key-statistics?p=GDDCF)). Then again, a company's value depending on the value they actually produce is not necessarily bad. \n* **Trading volume has an average of 186k**, which is not a lot yet. Probably because it is only available on Toronto Stock Exchange so far. ( [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPOT.V/key-statistics?p=SPOT.V](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPOT.V/key-statistics?p=SPOT.V) ). However, with the last earnings, it has increased to an average of 480k. \n* Trading on Canadian Stock exchange might costs fees. You have to evaluate if it\u2019s worth for you.\n* Not on Stocktwits and finviz.com yet.\n* People might like the idea of resource exploration and try to found their own AI / Data Science company. So far the only other real competitor I have identified is Minerva intelligence, but they are much more speculative and fragile as a company. \n* Not available on e.g. Robinhood yet. Hopefully it will get listed on more brokers soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecent and short term catalysts\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Literally today (April 14, 2021) they announced another partnership with TRU Precious metal corp in Newfoundland Canada. \n* In 2021, they announced helping 3 different mining companies find gold (actual results!) and have been hired by 4 others. These guys keep getting new partnerships\n* The CEO has recently said in an interview that they are working on getting the stock on RobinHood and other traders. This would take the stock out of the metaphorical suburb of Canadian stock market and move it to the big city. \n* Just this week the stock has been added to wealthsimple when it briefly went over 0,50$C/share\n* Earnings announcement of Q1 2021 in the beginning on May 21 2021. Q4 earnings already showed great growth. If they keep the same rythm, they'll exceed expected earnings yet again\n\nLong term catalysts/ the next step\n\n* Marketing the company to mining corps outside of North America. Much of Goldspot's business is done in Canada so far, but as a cloud-based service company, they aren't limited by geographical constraints. Their next targets are Australia and Asia. \n* Extension of the software and service to other materials/metals. The team has mentioned this is among their next steps, but there isn't a fixed calendar for this\n* R&amp;D. Lots of it. Goldspot has 17M invested in developing over 40 products. I cannot guarantee that all their products are going to deliver or be impactful, but this is a company that strives to keep innovating and will stay relevant in the future. \n* They started acquiring their own junior mining companies to direct their own exploration. They acquired Golden Planet Mining last year, which then saw 1600% gains in 4 months...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnd of DD disclaimer\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Please do your own research.\n* At least type the name into Google once.\n* I cannot thank u/vrweensy enough. Honestly &gt;80% of what's up here is his work. If you're reading this man, please don't sue me. Knowledge benefits us all\n\nCheers people!",

The other video conferencing solutions were not built from the ground up with cybersecurity in mind. Cyber security is critical in today's interconnected world. You have all heard about the latest Zoom breaches in which hackers exploited video conferences and stole nonpublic confidential information from corporations.

        "selftext": "*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Disclosure: GNPK currently makes up about 50% of my portfolio* \n\n*TL;DR: GNPK has one of the best SPAC valuations of all time ($615M EV represents 3.77x 2021 revenue), is legitimately already a hyper-growth (40%+ CAGR) company, and has the industry-disruptive technology to become an 80%+ CAGR company starting in 2023.* \n\n*TL;DR of TL;DR: GNPK starts with a G and this dude is just trying to pump his position, don\u2019t even bother reading\u2026*\n\n**Introduction:** Like many of you, what first stood out to me was how well GNPK seemed to be valued for a space SPAC. However, some here seemed to think GNPK was too good to be true or that it's lacking growth, which could perhaps be used to explain why it's still sitting at $10.37. In future posts, I intend to share much more behind the legitimacy of this company and the exciting products under its arsenal, but as a starting point, let's look at the financials. After all, it should be hard to argue with the  financial numbers that Redwire has already achieved.\n\nFirst, I won\u2019t bother comparing GNPK with other space SPAC financials as there\u2019s simply no comparison: everything else is either pre-revenue, have just a fraction of Redwire\u2019s revenues, or won\u2019t be Free Cash Flow positive for a few years. At a trading price of $10, Redwire is valued at $615M EV with an expected **2021** revenue of $163M. Furthermore, it is already free cash flow positive, with $20M Adj. EBITDA and $17M FCF expected in 2021. More details on its financials can be seen below:\n\n|Year|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue ($M)|82|119|163|237|424|766|1413|\n|Growth||45%|37%|45%|79%|81%|84%|\n|Adjusted EBITDA ($M)||13|20|32|64|124|250|\n|Free Cash Flow ($M)||16|17|26|46|101|195|\n\n**The Best SPAC Valuation of all Time?**\n\nI think the interesting question to me is not whether GNPK is the most attractively-valued space SPAC out there, but most attractively-valued SPAC in general--at least when we consider hype sectors such as EV, sustainability, space, etc. So, in the table below, I\u2019ve listed the SPACs that I consider to have had the best valuations and are naturally now the kings of the SPAC world. (*Note: this comparison is not meant to knock down these other SPACs, as I think these are all fantastic companies and valuations)*\n\n|Year|2019 ($M)|2020 ($M)|2021 ($M)|2022 ($M)|2023 ($M)|Market Cap ($M)|Market Cap at Current Price ($M)|Current Trading Price|2023 Gross Margin %|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|STPK (Stem)|17.6|35.5|147|315|526|1354|3510|$25.92|32%|\n|DMYD (Genius Sports)|115|145|238|||1677|3689|$22.00|?|\n|TPGY (EVBox)|72|84|144|270|446|1394|2703|$19.39|38%|\n|ACTC (Proterra)|181|193|246|439|838|2401|4293|$17.88|4%|\n|NGA (Lion Electric)|30.9|23.4|204|668|1672|1949|3235|$16.60|18%|\n|GNPK (Redwire)|82|119|163|237|424|675|700|$10.37|30%|\n\nFrom the table, we can see that GNPK measures up quite well to these Tier 1 SPACs. GNPK\u2019s revenue numbers aren\u2019t much below the others listed, but crucially, it has a market cap valuation that\u2019s less than half of the nearest valued company ($675M for GNPK vs. $1354M for STPK) when all are trading at $10 even though space should be one of the most hype sectors out there. Even more notably, based on today\u2019s trading prices, GNPK\u2019s market cap is only \u00bc of the nearest company ($700M for GNPK and $2703M for TPGY). This is somewhat jaw-dropping to me and is why I continue to add to my already massive large position as GNPK.\n\n**Bear cases of \"too good to be true\" and \"not enough growth\" contradicted by 40%+ 2020/2021 CAGR, $70M+ recent wins, and $150M+ backlog**\n\nOK, so what\u2019s the catch? Well, one bear case I\u2019ve heard is that the market is not expecting Redwire to achieve much growth. However, I think GNPK and industry tailwinds has proven otherwise. Let\u2019s take what they already have accomplished as a starting point. From 2019 to 2020, their revenue increased from $82M to $115M (45% increase). In 2021 revenue is expected to increase to $163M (37% increase). From slide 32 of the investor presentation, we see that 85% of this $163M in revenue has already been achieved through a backlog of orders (67%) or contracts where Redwire is the incumbent (18%). Only 15% of the $163M has to be achieved in new business for the remainder of this year. I actually expect Redwire to beat this number because in Slide 30, we see that from Dec 2020 to Feb 2021 alone, Redwire has gotten over $70M in recent wins (probably not all for 2021 bookings). On March 9th, 2021, Redwire also announced that they were selected as the Solar Array supplier for PlnaetiQ. With 9 months left in the year, I think Redwire will easily beat their 2021 projections.\n\nAdditionally, we see that the investor presentation highlights $150M in backlog. However, I think this is more like $220M. According to the CFO\u2019s remarks in their [investor presentation at 30:50](https://youtu.be/q960XBFkj2s?t=1850), these $70M in recent wins is on top of the $150M in backlog they already have and will soon become backlog as well. I\u2019m guessing they can\u2019t officially categorize the $70M as backlog yet due to some legal reasons, but ultimately this would bring their backlog to $220M.\n\nConsidering what Redwire has already achieved so far, I think a conservative CAGR projection for Redwire would be 40%, which meets the hypergrowth benchmark. Indeed, Redwire is projecting a CAGR of  37% in 2021 and 45% in 2022. If we keep the CAGR at 40%, this puts the EV to EBITDA ratio at about \\~13 in 2023 and \\~9 in 2024.\n\n**Bonus: Redwire's capex requirements are quite minimal, esp. for a space company**\n\nIn 2021, Capex is expended to only be $6M, which is very little compared to it expected revenue of $163M. This is due to Redwire's business model as providing the picks and shovels of the space industry. Rather than requiring a lot of infrastructure to make their business work, they are the ones providing the infrastructure to make space businesses work.\n\n**The CAGR jumping to 80% in 2023 is...actually realistic?**\n\nThe crazy thing is Redwire is actually projecting the CAGR to jump to 80% starting in 2023. Is this way too optimistic? Even if it is too crazy, I don\u2019t really care because even with 40% CAGR, I think the company looks really good. However, I think this isn\u2019t as unreasonable as you might think. First, industry analysts such as Bank of America project the space industry [to increase from $420B in 2019 to $1.4T in 2030](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/why-the-space-industry-may-triple-to-1point4-trillion-by-2030.html). China/US entering into a space race, Project Artemis getting humans to the moon by 2024 and later on to Mars, ARKX starting up, and several space companies starting to go public seem to support this.\n\nAlso, 2023 is key for Redwire because this is when I think Redwire is expecting their crown jewel investment, Made in Space, to start paying off big time. In early 2023, Made in Space will beam their [Archinaut One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir_SLjykvRE&amp;list=WL&amp;index=37) to space, which NASA awarded $73.7M to them in July 2019 to complete. The capabilities demonstrated by Archinaut One have the potential to transform how anything and everything that is in space is assembled. If you want to feel that child-like wonder again, search some YouTube videos on \u201cArchinaut One\u201d or \u201cMade in Space.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s so much more I want to talk about with Archinaut, Made in Space, other Redwire components, and the future of space. I\u2019m going to have to save these details for a future post, as this is getting too long. Stay tuned, my fellow Archinauts...",

Cox, the new CEO, has a very impressive resume and track record of success. A licensed attorney &amp; Harvard grad with an MBA, this is the kind of guy you would see taking an executive position at a Fortune 500, multi-billion dollar corporation, not an OTC Pink sheet company.\n\nCEO's LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-cox-/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-cox-/)\n\n*Highlights*\n\n* Served as **President** of Adaptation Financial Advisors, a financial services firm managing over **$500** **million** in assets with **$4.5 billion** of life insurance in force. **Added $150** **million** in new AUM to the firm\n* Grew **UPS** subsidiary ConnectShip from **$300 million to $6 billion** in revenue\n* Created the vision behind **Logistyx Technologies**\u2019 formation, raised the capital to execute the roll-up, and co-founded Logistyx with Kidd &amp; Company and McClarty Capital. As part of the formation of Logistyx, **led the acquisition of more than 14 different entities** across the United States, Europe, and Asia. Logistyx has become the dominant player in the transportation execution technology space\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second news release came after market closed this afternoon. Kevin shares the company's strategic growth strategy, vision, mission, and corporate objectives. The company will be transformed into a platform holding company and will be launching a full rebrand -- changing the company name, ticker symbol, and website ([https://livetobehappy.com/](https://livetobehappy.com/))\n\n*The platform holding company will have 5 primary divisions:*\n\n* Real Estate\n* Education\n* Technology\n* Entertainment\n* Health and Wellness\n\n*At least 3 potential acquisitions were mentioned in the release. Catalysts!*\n\nPrior to the addition of Kevin Cox as CEO, the company seemed to be doing well as their 2020 Annual Report shows $10.5+ million in revenue with over $7.5 million in Assets versus $250,000 in Liabilities.   \n\n\nThey are also on track to exceed their entire 2020 Annual Revenue seemingly in the first half of 2021, as they have over $11.3 million in deals-in-progress. Some with pretty large companies -- JP Orleans as well as TRI Pointe Homes (A $2.5+ billion dollar company that trades on the NYSE under ticker symbol TPH). Press release from February 17, 2021 --&gt;  [CAVU Resources Expects Record 2020 Annual Revenue; Q4 2020 Revenue up 727% Quarter-over-Quarter](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/02/17/2177270/0/en/CAVU-Resources-Expects-Record-2020-Annual-Revenue-Q4-2020-Revenue-up-727-Quarter-over-Quarter.html)\n\n  \nStill a lot more digging to do but will save for future posts--- as I am seeing other interesting individuals &amp; businesses connected with the company. \n\nBased on the current share structure (less than 450 million shares in the float), I believe the upside can be significant. Other recent/current high flyers such as HMBL (TSNP), AITX, OZSC, ENZC all have 2-4 billion shares in their floats and were able to achieve market caps well over $1 Billion.  \n\n\n[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/CAVR/security](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/CAVR/security)\n\n[Rare for an OTC-- minimal dilution to the float in 2+ Years](https://preview.redd.it/11w214i029u61.jpg?width=370&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab2ed9b2401d4866b9b97f9d9a944b2d000166c5)",

I straight up forgot it was a short week so I was scrambling to write all this out cause I normally do it all last minute like a dipshit college student. If you\u2019re too lazy to read this trash, you can find a video recap of the notes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxzAMzz5GSU). Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Over the weekend, **Bill Hwang, manager of Archegos Capital Management** blew up his entire \u201cfamily-owned\u201d hedge fund in an epic blaze of glory. It was rumored that Billy Boy was running with 20 BILLION dollars of equity on 5x leverage and was margin called after things inevitably went tits up. What blows my mind is that this motherfucker had more money than god, but still felt it was necessary to leverage himself up to the eyeballs like a true degenerate. Live fast, die young, I guess. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks, alongside American media conglomerates **Discovery** (DISC) and **ViacomCBS** (VIAC). Upon liquidation, most of the tickers that were formerly held by the fund plunged over 40%. In a surprise that shocked no one, the banks who allowed yung Bill to leverage himself to the sun and back, Nomura (NMR) and **Credit Suisse (CS), warned that their earnings might take a \u201csignificant hit\u201d following the margin call**, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. Regardless, I hope everyone comes out of this fun little debacle unscathed, and that Bill doesn\u2019t Hwang himself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- On Monday morning, the massive container-ship blocking the Suez Canal was dislodged! During this week-long blockade, roughly **$9 billion in revenue was lost per day**. That\u2019s equal to 0.5 Archegos Capital Management funds getting blown up every 24 hours, ON TOP of the original one that also got blown up. I know I already went over this, but God dammit Billy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- On Wednesday, the **White House revealed its new, massive infrastructure proposal**, consisting of roughly $2 trillion to help rehabilitate and build out the country's infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. The plan is expected to address a variety of additional issues, such as drinking-water management systems, roads and bridges, refitting and building affordable housing that is environmentally sustainable, elderly welfare, and U.S. manufacturing. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose **raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring**. I don\u2019t really know why Biden is acting like us poors won\u2019t foot the bill on higher taxes while the rich use loopholes to get out of it. He claims that \u201cNo one making under $400k will see federal tax increase\u201d, which in a sense, is true. We won\u2019t *see* it, but it\u2019ll indirectly increase anyways. I had the unfortunate pleasure of having to listen to this guys speech, which happened to be boring as fuck. I just wish Biden accidentally muttered \u201cPalantir\u201d on live TV, or told us all to buy APHA and TSLA or something.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Throughout the week **DraftKings** (DKNG) announced a boatload of new partnerships, and acquisitions, the first of which being with the WWE. DKNG and WWE entered an agreement to make the sports betting company the official gaming partner of the WWE, following a deal DKNG made with the UFC recently. I don\u2019t really know why anyone would want to gamble on ***scripted events***, but hey, maybe I'm just a dipshit. People could gamble on Family Guy episodes for all I care, as long as my calls print. **DKNG also acquired Vegas Sports Information Network Inc.**, a multi-platform broadcast and content company providing sports betting news, analysis and data. VSiN, which operates out of Las Vegas, develops, produces, and distributes up to 18-plus hours of live linear sports betting content each day in addition to its sport-themed 24/7 stream. Although DKNG actually closed the week down 1.36%, all these deals and partnerships are really awesome, and are definitely a step in the right direction for the company.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- On Wednesday it was announced that **Microsoft (MSFT) won a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $22 billion over 10 years**. The tech giant is committed to furnish 120,000 AR headsets for the Army based on their Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) design requirements. The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact with them using hand and voice gestures. I'm a big ass nerd, so all this kind of gets me excited for the potential future of AR video games and shit. Regardless, this contract comes a year and a half after Microsoft won a cloud contract from the Pentagon that could be worth up to $10 billion, firmly embedding MSFT\u2019s place within our government. MSFT closed the week up nearly 5%, a meteoric rise for such a behemoth of a stock.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **BlackBerry** (BB) reported earnings on Tuesday, and let me tell you, it *wasn\u2019t* pretty. BB reported a loss of $315 million, or 56 cents a share, after posting losses of 7 cents a share a year ago. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $210 million, down from $282 million in the same period last year. The earnings call was a fucking disaster. Our homie John Chen came onto the call and basically said *\u201cyeah, we lost a shitload of money, we've sucked for the past decade, but now we suck way more. Also, the SEC got mad at how we're casually bullshitting our numbers, and oh, the one thing that actually generates consistent revenue for us? We decided to stop doing it altogether on the off-chance that we can get someone else to buy it\u201d*. Obviously I paraphrased it, but that\u2019s more or less what he said. Feel free to listen to the two hour call if you don\u2019t believe me. A poor report, combined with abysmal guidance, means that I\u2019m gonna be bagholding this shit forever. What the fuck. BlackBerry closed the week down 11%.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Thursday was an awesome day for EVs, with both **NIO** and **XPEV** releasing their monthly vehicle deliveries. NIO set a new monthly record of 7,257 deliveries, resulting in a total of 20,060 deliveries in their first quarter, marking a gain of over 423% year-over-year. XPEV reported similar results, having delivered 5,102 vehicles in March, resulting in 13,340 Q1 deliveries, marking an even higher 487% gain YOY. On Friday, the homie Elon finally took a break from pumping Dogecoin, and reported  184,800 Q1 vehicle deliveries, making the Chinese EV manufacturers look like chumps. Luckily for us, this bomb was dropped after hours, though I\u2019m sure come Monday we\u2019ll see a nice jump in **TSLA**. XPEV closed the week out up 17%, with NIO trailing closely behind, closing up a little over 11%.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- To end this week off on some good news, the **S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed at a new all time high of 400**! Throughout the trading day on Thursday, SPY was sexually attracted to, but equally disgusted by 400. With 15 minutes left on the clock, SPY finally took that leap of faith, and closed the week out at $400.86. I remember a year ago, someone said that they thought S&amp;P stood for Stimulus and Printer 500. At the time, I laughed at the man, but today, I finally understood what he was saying. He wasn\u2019t wrong. What a historic moment.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll in all, that wraps up this week's recap! Just remember, that even if you somehow managed to lose money this month, unless you\u2019ve blown up your account five times over, you\u2019re still outperforming Archegos Capital Management. Let\u2019s pour one out for Billy Boy, for he flew too close to the sun. I hope you all get to spend time with loved ones this weekend, and I wish you all a happy Easter.

        "selftext": "**In today\u2019s post I\u2019m going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio &amp; much more!**\n\n**\\[Disclaimer: Long Post\\]**\n\nFolks, we\u2019ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields &amp; inflations scares from boohoo \u201csuits\u201d that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.\n\n[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon &amp; a couple of other stocks.\n\nI believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE\u2019s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE\u2019s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon &amp; others.\n\nSmall-caps &amp; value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE\u2019s as well due to the recent \u201cbooming economy\u201d helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.\n\nJust take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) &amp; you can see that small &amp; mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid &amp; small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% &amp; 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow &amp; SP500.\n\nGuys, let\u2019s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:\n\n**1.** **Inflation &amp; Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**\n\nMy short answer is **NO**. I don\u2019t think the massive stimulus packages &amp; other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe &amp; the US.\n\nThough you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package &amp; proposed infrastructure bill.\n\nMost of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED &amp; mostly everyone is already expecting this.\n\nOn the other hand, if by any miracle, we don\u2019t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks &amp; especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.\n\n[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn\u2019t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy &amp; given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.\n\nIt\u2019s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.\n\n**2. FED Rates.**\n\nSo, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.\n\nRight [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.\n\nThe [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.\n\nThe dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)\u2026 just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.\n\nIt\u2019s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).\n\nWe can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.\n\nThis will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.\n\n**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**\n\nWe have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week.\n\nNonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%.\n\nIt\u2019s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.\n\nThe 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.\n\n[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure &amp; hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.\n\n**4. Suez Canal blockage**\n\n[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it\u2019s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.\n\n**5.** **EVs**\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.\n\n[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.\n\nThough I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper &amp; cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 &amp; model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla &amp; their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.\n\nEVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it\u2019s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.\n\n**6.** **Economic Readings**\n\nThe consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven\u2019t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices &amp; inflation possibilities.\n\nThe [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it\u2019s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.\n\n**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**\n\nLike in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn\u2019t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with my investment\u201d. That\u2019s exactly what we see during the optimism &amp; euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can\u2019t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation &amp; discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.\n\nWell I think we\u2019ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech &amp; small-cap stocks, with CNN\u2019s Fear &amp; Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.\n\nThat\u2019s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.\n\nThese were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless &amp; unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.\n\nExpect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute\u2019s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLiterally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We\u2019re coming off a low base,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks \u2014 unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n&gt; # All eyes on earnings\n&gt; \u201cThe macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. \u201cThat will be the next thing to turn to.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,\u201d noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2\u00bd\u20133% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,\u201d Golub wrote.\n*****\n&gt; # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that\u2019s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApril is usually good. It\u2019s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It\u2019s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.\n*****\n&gt; The market enters the \u201csell in May\u201d period during the second quarter. The market adage, \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,\u201d Stovall said. \u201cTech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; The producer price index \u2014 which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output \u2014 will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC\u2019s Sara Eisen.\n*****\n&gt; Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/W5VnHdw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OWAqXe4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/seUECBP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/8x71bbA.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/B0iQJ5r.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/walbCuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pBIopWq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mZ6A4CJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H4WjcRK.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5iiOoya.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Mx4A08w.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JR37Qxb.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EHPQCzz.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Love April\n\n&gt; \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n&gt; What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Just how strong has April been lately? \u201cI had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOther than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:\n\n&gt; * Since 1950 it is the second best month\n&gt; * The past 20 years it is the best month\n&gt; * The past 10 years it is the second best month\n&gt; * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking it a step further, here\u2019s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After\n\n&gt; Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It\u2019s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie\u2014a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n&gt; \u201cFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a \u2018what have you done for me lately\u2019 industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.\u201d\n\n&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Inflation\n\n&gt; As we continue LPL Research\u2019s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow\u2019s blog, where we\u2019ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that\u2019s under control is a tailwind for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.\u201d\n\n&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The inflation question is one that isn\u2019t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus.

        "selftext": "This is an old DFV play I've been holding for a while. We were looking for $5 -&gt; $15, and we got it. But the fundamentals are about to change. In this post I won't be looking at their current fundamentals. **I'm going to focus on an entirely new stream of revenue from their existing products that few have considered.** To understand where Funko is headed, we need to understand the secondary market implications of **tokenization.**\n\n# \n\n# With the coming [vN - F - T project](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210401005942/en/Funko-Announces-Plans-to-Enter-NFT-Market-Using-WAX-on-vIRL-Merchandise-On-the-Blockchain), everything I discuss will be of direct relevance to the company in 2 months. I won't even talk about the digital currency, so how about you go easy on the ban, mods. \n\nThere's a massive lack of understanding about this stuff and now that it's tying in with reality . I welcome an honest discussion on the impact of this facet of the company's new model\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarch 12, [(5:55) Funko\u2019s CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1t-SZBwBkM) Brian Mariotti dropped the bomb. Yeah, *you know* the three letters. And who cares at this point, right? Well, **they're linking them to the rarest physical collectables**. So, at least their large existing following, and all of the noise that's still looking for the next big thing. TLDR; there's a very clear path forward for their business model that disrupts current garbage and already makes sense to normies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Intro\n\nPeople LOVE spending way too much for these things already. You could argue all day about the 'value' of keywords that I won't mention, but it would just come back to this: Funkopops already have a provably strong and growing demand. Collector AND consumer, so both retail and on the **secondary market**. Random internet people bidding up the value of rare Funkopops is a phenomon that goes back further than any of the current digital trends. Of which, by the way, funko will now be able to ***take a portion of the sales on each transaction***. THIS, my friends, is all you need to know about what the hell an NFSki technology can do. **People are going to be paying Funko so that they can sell their product many times over for them at a higher price.** You read that right. Those completely oblivious to the technology don't see that this is almost certainly their primary incentive for facilitating smart contracts in the first place. Besides hype, why else use a \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*chain network? It's certainly not decentralization, because we have to rely on FNKO to deliver the collectable anyways. FNKO will be the first publicly traded collectables company to reap digital transaction tax on third party marketplaces. \n\nAdditionally, The strategy they've chosen for distributing them will force collectors looking only for the rare physical one to purchase as many digital prints as necessary until they find it. It's pure evil genius. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Sentiment rising. \n\nCall OI has steadily increased 200x-ish since earnings and the interview. [8.2:1 c/p ratio](https://www.streetinsider.com/Options/Funko+%28FNKO%29+call+put+ratio+8.2+calls+to+1+put+with+focus+on+April+20+and+25+calls+as+shares+rally+1.9%25/18221948.html). Check out the [fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/fnko) and observe the rising short volume with price increases. What's happening with FNKO makes perfect sense following a memestonk model. I'm looking at the range we're in to continue widening as there will be an increasing disconnect from the usual suspects HAS, MAT, etc towards the NFSki meme basket until **June**, when they're set to launch sets weekly. What many see is a confident collectables company, with a massive swathe of the most popular IPs licensed, about to show the world how well they already understand gaming artificial scarcity. **The technology uniquely benefits them**, because at-present they're missing out on revenue from sales in their unusually large secondary market (sales that most often exceed retail price). I would have looked for better returns past $20 were the company not making big moves. \n\nIn other words, there's a method to this madness. The CEO is no boomer; he understands his company's duty is to stay on top of pop-culture and trends. Three weeks after the initial hint in the interview, on April 1st (terrible timing for this news, by the way) FNKO [acquired](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210401005204/en/Funko-Enters-NFT-Market-with-Majority-Stake-in-TokenHead-Developer) [TokenHead](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210401005204/en/Funko-Enters-NFT-Market-with-Majority-Stake-in-TokenHead-Developer)/wave which is apparently the most popular wallet via user count. They've also properly partnered with the coins they'll use, WAX, but I'll stick to the company. They already have the first set(s) licensed and ready. The platform is established, and having tried it there are: basically no transaction fees, and you can buy in the U.S., with a credit card, without doing KYC. These are some HUGE ups if you aren't familiar. Both skipping KYC and being available in the U.S. is rare for a digital currency - this will be extremely important for getting regular collectors on board.  \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why is FNKO THE collectable to tokenize?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**p.1 autism**\n\nFirst off, they're doing a very neat thing. But even were it just the pure cash-grab, if we use relative market caps of the few other legit projects in the space, taking this hilarious market seriously for *just a second*, their **Intellectual Property licenses are worth far more than the company itself.** Yes, billions. Insane, but just *try* and argue with that level speculation right now. If we assume FNKO should also be inflated (not even including use-case for the tech, and the best IPs), then they're currently heavily undervalued. ***It's simple autism.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe licenses FNKO controls include: Disney/Star Wars, Marvel... There's already a hell of a lot more content between just those two worlds, if I'm honest. \n\n**p.2 no it's actually really good**\n\nThe bull case for them doing NFSkis: Funko has over 1,100 licenses, carrying just about any pop culture reference you can think of. They're poised to facilitate (and collect economic rents on) the *digital* consumerism of a massive percentage of the world's largest IPs. Unlike almost every other company attempting to hop on this bandwagon, their positioning to crank these out indefinitely to completely different audiences is *prime*. I really don't think it can be understated. They will never run out of desirable content without ever having to recycle. I would love to go more into ridiculousness of that market, but it may not be here to stay and you really have to see it it yourself to believe it. TL;DR: [it's about the IP](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/why-nfts-are-hard-to-explain-48f0ab0a35bf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ___________________________________________________________________\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other keystone here is that we're Tokenizing Physical Collectables^(tm), not just minting NFSkis. The difference is important to understand and **EXTREMELY INTUITIVE, because it's tangible. This is the reason I believe in the immediate success of this idea and long term sustainability.** The Funkopop analogy is seriously the best way I've found to get that instant lightbulb-moment across age demographics. Try explaining NFSkis to someone who doesn't care, much less the idea of paying for it. Forget all the keywords. Have you heard of Funkopops? Try it with your mom - this is groundbreaking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \u2022 Situation A: You own the Funkopop. That's it, you own the Funkopop. *Cool!,* some might say. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \u2022 Situation B. You own a Funkopop NFSki. A digital version of the Funkopop. It's also a one-time-use for redeeming that exact same Pop IRL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n80% of the time: \"Oh, okay, I get it\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd unlike every other example you could give of NFSkis, people don't even question it. \n\n**\"I think it's stupid, but whatever, I get why people buy Funkopops\"** \n\nSo I'm not sure why I'm surprised when people apply that same leniency to buying a Funkopop NFSki!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is what successful projects have in common: **Forget about the fucking \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*chain**! If the benefits can exist without requiring the user to understand how they work, then you have a product that fits. I have wrote an article explaining Tokenization and minting using FNKO as an example, to go more in depth. But adoption rate is far more important than loyal techies, as far as FNKO is concerned. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tokenization is what will** **transform the secondary market of Funkopops, at the same time allowing their business model to directly benefit from its success**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*on the hype bubble: Traders, scalpers, speculators are far more likely to choose the liquidity and other advantages that come with tokenization.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee for instance: what's happening recently when Funko releases a common Pop for which demand will clearly eclipse their ability to immediately supply. Baby yoda, for instance. They sell out quickly after listing, and immediately afterwards the **pre-orders** are flipped on eBay-type marketplaces. This is a hilariously free market. It works, but I would never recommend anyone trust an internet person to deliver you their pre-order.\n\nIn this instance we have a digital representation of the Funkopop, but it's terribly insecure and costs a 50% premium. Good for that guy, I suppose. There's clearly demand to buy the right to sell even though it's illegal in this case and quite possibly a scam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, *we will be able to trade digital representations freely trusting FNKO's partners' technology.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn other words, this is what's going to happen:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThey release a hot, topical reference to something prevalent in today's culture. I want to believe it's within the cards that they team with a meme like Roaring Kitty, WSB, or just do diamond hands through their Gamestop partnership, but I'll use a realistic example of the Mandalorian. We can make a decent guess that they'll be issuing at least one figure of the Star Wars Gamestop exclusive as a vNFSki\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy June, They'll be the first tied to proper, existing Physical Collectables(!!), and also among the first publicly traded companies benefiting from the trend. This paints them as innovative, early adopters. Because of FNKO's history and the power of Disney's brand, to investors, this is seen as *smart, rather than a scam* in the risky environment of new ideas. And by 'investors', I mean both of the pops and the company. There is a lack of exposure to the trend in ways that that (Funko is literally the only one, correct me if I'm wrong) have financial grounding in existing, traditional markets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe know they have this deal with Disney, so it's extremely distinct from any other piece of Disney derived content you can currently have 'digital ownership' of. The public has quickly come to understand this concept. From the speculators point of view, FNKO is creating an interesting opportunity by connecting you to ownership of Disney brand Intellectual Property through their licensing and distribution of it. You may notice this is similar to the original argument for Funkopops Vinyl collectables - the ability to hold authentic derivatives of culture (in the most classical sense of the word *meme*) in your hand, to signal fandom or give as gifts. However, this new crowd is entirely separate, larger, and richer than the Funkopop crowd of decades past. Digital collectors are fucking insane, and they have different motivations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Digital mania: the Funkining\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So,** a bunch of *memelords* who bought the *Shibu Innu* currency before Elon Musk tweeted about it are going to exhaust Funko's supply of rare TPCs as fast as they're allowed to. I have almost no doubt. But it necessarily gets deeper once we consider that these digital speculators may only be interested in the \\***T**oken\\* for digital trading purposes, while the original collectors may be more interested in the \\***P**hysical **C**ollectable\\*. This is a fair assumption, but one where we run out of real-life examples for due to the unique setup. Unlike contracts, these TPCs are unrenewable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we can trust FNKO to honor the physical to digital rares at 1:1 ***P****hysical* ***C****ollectables*, I'm willing to bet at least 50% of these ultra rare and expensive PCs ***never leave the warehouse***. Meanwhile, it's entirely viable to have a manic run on secondary markets with just the tokens representing them. In essence the demand for digital deliverables may surpass In this scenario, there will be a difference of demand tied to trading advantages inherent to the tokenized version. The token's *utility* will express itself as a price difference from its ingredients: the physical collectable itself combined with the useless token you're left with afterwards. In economic terms, it would rest above NAV due to its utility in the secondary market as the superior trading instrument. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Redeemable token =/= Physical collectable + exhausted token   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ex: ($500) Redeemable token &gt; ($450) Rare Funkopop + ($40) exhausted token\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaying $10 to keep a rare collectable safe from damage (a protector case + storage unit) is **cheap**. $10 is easily just the shipping for an item that can't be damaged without losing value. I believe 2% ($10) to be an extremely low estimation of the *utility* of Tokenized Physical Collectables, which I'll call TPC from hereon out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What are the effects then of the most hardcore Funkopop collectors, then, who will demand physical delivery to complete their collection regardless?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, they'll redeem the Funkopop of course. Why wouldn't *you*? Actually, because this could be a HUGE mistake from a trading perspective! **If the 2021 digital economy keeps this breakneck pace, the tokenized marketplace is going to absolutely dominate the existing secondary market of items which compete in both.** Nevermind the storage, shipping and care needed for physical items - I'd like to be able to exit my positions instantly, from anywhere, anytime, thank you, and perhaps in the volume of dozens or hundreds. **These are advantages the digital traders are used to and will not forego**. In a minute we'll throw some wild de-fi leveraging in the mix to really get this baby going\\*. What people miss about tokenization of non-securities is that it provides a massive boost to liquidity and accessibility. Instead of being limited by FNKO's global presence, it can literally be listed on any exchange anywhere in the world. Epic, because most of these absolutely *greasy traders* have no intention of redeeming the pop anyways. And, theoretically, it would also be better to hold onto the TPC, because **using them would have a deflationary effect**:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE TOKENS ARE EFFECTIVELY OUT OF CIRCULATION**. The Pop itself is back to being sold on eBay at best, roadshows at worst. By redeeming it, you've removed the TPC utility FROM and OF the token. You now have a used an exhuasted Token and a Physical Collectable. Linked, but no longer functional as a digital representation of physical trade. An eBay order could include the used token, but that TPC is out of circulation. There may still be 100 Pops, but now only 99 digital representations of the redeemable token exist for verified, instant, online trade. This number will always be opposite the PC supply in 'circulation' of the real world. The digital traders and physical collectors are at direct odds here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The TPCs become more valuable than the pops themselves for trading, even though they're 'backed' by the value of the PC. The TPCs can become** ***more*** **scarce even if the PCs they represent aren't destroyed.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow imagine 70 collectors want their IRL pops. The digital crowd will be busily trading just **30 TPCs.** ***Or will they???*** So here's the final piece, and I promise we're in the home stretch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll keep this section incredibly short. De-fi is trying to do some super wacky stuff in terms of **collateralizing digital assets**. NFSkis are on many roadmaps by Q3/4 of this year - essentially taking out a loan against your digitally represented physical thing (often to buy even more of the thing on leverage). *TPCs will be a far better instrument for this than regular digital art, and I see a digital version of this coming:* \"In fact, the value of a TPC Funkopop is triple A +++ rated\". *For decades they have always gone for at least x on the secondary market.* It kind of sounds like a massive bubble waiting to happen in the latter half of the year: I'm here for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Final Abstraction (I almost hope I'm wrong on this): ... Yield's farming's value proposition for TPC Pops in De-fi\n\n# \n\nSo say of those 30 TCPs, one guy owns 15. With a typical **NFSki,** the reason you can't take collateral on your 15, buy the other 15, and then sell all 30 higher is the fact that you're clearly the only buyer in this situation. However with a TPC, **the value doesn't originate from other buyers of the TPC**. At least, past deterring the utility cost of the Token. **The \"value\" is \"backed\" by the PC and physical collectors' desire to have the thing**. So we look to the secondary market, which has only ever known the PC. But with the convolution of yield farming for TPC in de-fi, **we have not only utility but financial incentive** to prefer the TPCs over the PCs. If you were just going to sit on your Pop anyways, why not earn some passive return on it? Jeez, Rick, Funkopops were supposed to be fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**Plus or minus that last part, there is going to be a caveat to these TPCs, and it's that they're more 'useful' to a majority of traders/'investors' than the Pops themselves. The sliding scale of scarcity between the TPC and PC - digital and traditional secondary markets is going to make FKNO a** ***lot*** **of money, and NFSkis are the how.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am long as funko 400 shares, 20 FNKO calls april - nov.

I will try to list all the cons I can find though. Let's start off with some stats!\n\n**Key Stats:**\n\nShare price as of April 15th: $1.21.\n\nShort Float: 21.27% as of March 31st according to [marketbeat.com](https://marketbeat.com) (decent squeeze candidate..)\n\nShort Borrow Rate: 74.55% as of today according to [fintel.io](https://fintel.io) \n\nFloat: 41.57M\n\nHeld by Insiders: 22.17%\n\nInstitutions: .21%\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\nCash: 988.7k\n\nDebt: 42.99k\n\nEarnings: UKNOWN (Con)\n\nLast ER in 2019: 13.06 million\n\n**Now with all of the stats out of the way, let's get into why I am excited for the future of this company!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efcj5x0bwft61.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86f3cf652f40a2c34b71be73161892abe5a7bd5a\n\n*So what is Color Star?*\n\nColor Star is a company centered around education and entertainment. If you visit their recently launched english version of their app ([https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colorworld/id1529123508](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colorworld/id1529123508)) you will see the various celebrity teachers and performers affiliated with Color Star. Basically, you pay for lessons from certain teachers or you can pay for online concerts. Their customer base is in China, but they have recently begun to branch out into the US (hence the app). As of now, according to [prnewswire.com](https://prnewswire.com), Color Star has a wopping 1 million user base and is growing! *CON*: Since U.S. social media is forbidden in China, it is hard to grasp the actual sentiment of Color Star. Here are all of the locations Color Star is based:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Corporate Structure](https://preview.redd.it/ivyvojvx1gt61.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bebdabe2deb4df835b57e8efe9d5866de986197)\n\n*Dissecting their website (*[*https://colorstarinternational.com/*](https://colorstarinternational.com/)*)*\n\nAt first glance, the website is pretty unattractive. All of the instructors have 0-5 followers, and I could only find one review (which was 5-stars). Now, I am unsure if this is because the website only shows U.S. customers, and if so, the U.S. customers are so small they are irrelevant (for now). It basically looks like no one uses the website, which is a turn off to say the least. That is why it is hard to grasp the sentiment because it may be completely different in China. This is a red flag, but I am still very bullish because of the recent events!\n\n*Recent/Upcoming events (this is where I see huge growth potential for this company + the NFT part)*\n\n\\-Color Star is planning on being the first entertainment technology company to be dual-listed in the United States and United Arab Emirates, with it soon to be listed on NASDAQ Dubai.

Supre NFT website: [http://suprenft.com/](http://suprenft.com/)\n\n Color Star is planning on publishing concert tickets, film rights, music rights, TV rights, and video rights in the form of NFT! Now, as you all may know, NFTs are gaining an insane amount of popularity lately. Heck, I found out what NFTs were last month, and just recently, resold a $1 NFT for $570. There are many pros and cons of NFTs, but in my opinion, NFTs will be normalized and apart of our future. Companies who are getting in early on the potential of utilizing NFTs for their growth will prosper. The question is, which companies will be able to successfully use NFTs to their full potential? Amongst other tickers such as $HOFV, $YVR, $TKAT, $WKEY, this is for you to decide! \n\n**Closing thoughts:**\n\nThis was my first DD on a company, I know I am probably missing a lot but I tried my best. I hope I was as unbiased as possible, but as you can see I am very bullish on the future outlook for this company (and any other companies that are starting to incorporate NFTs..). So, if you believe this company has room to go places, then I am glad I showed you. If not, thanks for reading! This is not financial advice. Please also include any pros/cons or questions in the comments, and I will try my best to respond. Thanks, God bless!",

Following the completion of the Transaction, current shareholders of Renaissance will hold approximately 20,340,792 shares or 11.36% of the fully-diluted issued and outstanding shares of ReconAfrica.\n\nThe boards of directors of each of ReconAfrica and Renaissance, respectively, have unanimously approved the entering into of the LOI. The companies have agreed to a 30 -day exclusivity period to, among other things, negotiate and settle a definitive agreement.\n\n\u201cWith ReconAfrica\u2019s recent drilling success in the Kavango Basin, the Company has determined it is in the best interest of ReconAfrica shareholders to consolidate all interests,\u201d stated Scot Evans, CEO of ReconAfrica. \u201cRenaissance Oil\u2019s right to acquire 50% working interest in 2.2 million acres in the eastern part of the Kavango basin (Botswana) is potentially very valuable to ReconAfrica as it pursues the development of conventional resources in the basin.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsolidating all interests in the Kavango Basin to 8,500,000 acres, which covers the entire sedimentary basin, is in an accretive transaction for both ReconAfrica and Renaissance,\u201d stated Craig Steinke, CEO of Renaissance. \u201cThe combined company will solely focus on the development of the deep Kavango basin while exploring strategic alternatives for the Mexican assets.\u201d\n\nThe LOI is non-binding and there is no assurance that the Transaction will be completed as proposed or at all. The completion of the Transaction is subject to, among other things: (i) completion of satisfactory due diligence by each of ReconAfrica and Renaissance; (ii) negotiation of a definitive agreement and the entering into of a binding definitive agreement in connection with the Transaction, to include standard non-solicitation, superior proposal and right to match provisions (the \u201cDefinitive Agreement\u201d), following receipt by the board of directors of Renaissance of a fairness opinion in connection with the Transaction and the board of directors resolving to unanimously recommend that shareholders of Renaissance vote in favour of the Transaction; (iii) the entering into by the directors and officers of Renaissance of support and lock-up agreements on terms satisfactory to ReconAfrica to vote in favour of the Transaction; and (iv) receipt of all required corporate approvals from the board of directors of ReconAfrica and Renaissance, respectively, and all regulatory and shareholder approvals, including \u201cmajority of the minority\u201d shareholder approvals, as applicable, any competition or foreign investment approvals and the approval of the TSXV and any required third-party consents.\n\nNone of the securities to be issued pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement have been or will be registered under the United State Securities Act of 1933, as amended (*the \u201cU.S. Securities Act*\u201d), or any state securities laws, and any securities issued in the Arrangement are anticipated to be issued in reliance upon available exemptions from such registration requirements pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable exemptions under state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.\n\n**ReconAfrica** is a junior, Canadian oil and gas company engaged in the opening of the newly discovered deep Kavango Sedimentary Basin, in the Kalahari Desert of northeastern Namibia and northwestern Botswana, where ReconAfrica holds petroleum licenses comprising approximately 8.5 million contiguous acres. In all aspects of its operations, ReconAfrica is committed to minimal disturbances in line with international best standards and will implement environmental and social best practices in all of its project areas.\n\n**Renaissance** is an onshore operator in Mexico with 100% working interest in approximately 1200 boe/day. The Company holds an option to acquire a 50% working interest, in all rights from surface to basement, in a large Petroleum Licence, comprising 2.2 million acres in the Kavango sedimentary basin, in Botswana, Africa. The licence operator is ReconAfrica.",

They\u2019re just repeating a proven biotech business model.\n\n3) Executive team already multi-millionaires from previous successful ventures, they have not paid themselves a salary since starting $GLSI, and thus the CEO stated on video a few months ago they do NOT need to raise additional capital.\n\n4) CEO of $GLSI bought up 75% of the shares of GLSI\u2026high insider conviction!\n\n5) The drug originally developed by U.S. Gov, the CEO of GLSI bought the rights to the drug from the gov under the condition that GLSI would finish it\u2019s development through all the clinical trials.

        "selftext": " Repost, credit: u/thatorthobro many thanks to him, I just thought a catchier title would draw more people in to read this fantastic and objective DD. \n\nName: Goldspot Discoveries\n\nTicker: **SPOT.V** (TSX-V) or **GDDCF** (OTC) or **G.SPOT** (in my dreams)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis stock is a very promising **AI (Artificial Intelligence) Stock** by the name of **Goldspot Discoveries**. They use Machine Learning (subset of AI) to find **\u201cGold Spots\u201d**. This technology is planned for eventually being applied to other metals, but right now their money maker is gold.\n\n**TLDR**:\n\n* Goldspot Discoveries helps gold mining companies to **find gold via their machine learning/data science software**. They have experts such as former geologists and machine learning experts in their team. This gives them the edge over other machine learning companies of combining the sector expertise with ML for an \"all-included\" solution.\n* **They have been profitable since June 2020**. They have net assets worth 22M$ and revenue growth averaging &gt;100% per year for the last 4 years. This might be the only nanocap penny stock with great fundamentals/financials. Their money printing machine has been turned on.\n* Watch this video for a very good introduction (by the CEO of Goldspot Discoveries):[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyZSLuM0AoE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyZSLuM0AoE)\n* This is not a \"quick buck trade\" catalyst-centered DD. This is an undervalued company I believe is set for great things ahead.\n\n**EXTENDED VERSION**\n\nPros:\n\n* **Goldspot Discoveries is already profitable** (since June 2020). They\u2019re not relying on investments or debt. Revenue growing 126% in the last year. They have a cash reserve of 22 million, which is HUGE considering their market cap is only 46 million. You can compare it to any other company, they have way less cash. They managed to achieve this within 4 years. ([https://www.seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDDCF/profitability](https://www.seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDDCF/profitability))\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/trpybo6368t61.png?width=338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56c0306f58d2662132ef0e059ba963ba8d5fe90e](https://preview.redd.it/trpybo6368t61.png?width=338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56c0306f58d2662132ef0e059ba963ba8d5fe90e)\n\n* AI market is to **grow by 15 trillion $** by the year 2030. That\u2019s more than the Gold market cap of 10 trillion $. ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=684b6b991852](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=684b6b991852))\n* **They have almost no debt** (280k$, a laughable amount), meaning they are not reliant on investors money or other kinds of operating cash flow coverage. Other companies at this size or even way larger companies are far away from profitability and debt-freeness. This means that the company doesn't need to dilute shares to stay in business.\n* **They have multiple monetization strategies.** They make money through consulting mining firms,royalties from companies they have partnered with and they invest their cash into assets with a machine learning software they have developed themselves. (assets allocation:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGal9bxw7L8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGal9bxw7L8)) .\n* **What is their differentiator?** GoldSpot is a consulting company at its core. GoldSpot provides decision-support as a full package, the partner doesn't seem to have any expectation to interact with the ML. I think this is the right approach in this domain, since the barrier to entry for most companies is going to be building an internal team and GoldSpot provides that completely and seem willing and able to be flexible to their partners needs.\n* They improve the success rate of gold mining firms. Imagine this. You\u2019re leading a project and you\u2019re trying to find out where to dig for gold. Chances you find gold are very low. Then you hire Goldspot Discoveries which help you **improve these chances** by 4-5x. You wouldn\u2019t have to waste money on digging up dirt - at least not as much anymore. Also it is **environmental friendly** since less machine work is needed if the success rate is higher.\n* To go with the previous point, they accept payment through royalties or shares from junior mining companies they work for. Basically, if they find gold for a company, instead of taking a single payment, they can opt for a steady income stream which they **know** will benefit them, since they analyzed the geological data themselves.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/z23qhc3608t61.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91460743300033c694267a143b308ecfa85d657f](https://preview.redd.it/z23qhc3608t61.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91460743300033c694267a143b308ecfa85d657f)\n\n* Compared to other small AI Stocks: Better **PE Ratio** (4.5x), Better PB Ratio (2.54x), quarterly revenue growth is higher, High Return of equity ( **80.61%** ) Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement look better. Overall statistics are great. and this company is growing at a fast pace.\n* Their technology is easily usable/transferable to other resources (copper, lithium, nickel ..) as well. The Electrical Vehicle industry might benefit from more efficient mining as well in regards to the production of batteries for the cars.\n* They have worked with Vale Canada, a subsidiary of one of the Top 10 Mining companies in the world. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-10-24/goldspot-discoveries-and-vale-to-use-artificial-intelligence-at-coleman-mine](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-10-24/goldspot-discoveries-and-vale-to-use-artificial-intelligence-at-coleman-mine))\n* **How much gold is left to find on planet earth?** Most gold was found in China, Australia and South Africa - around 244,000 metric tons of gold. Around 2 Trillion worth of gold every 10 years is expected to be mined. (sauce:[ https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-much-gold-has-been-found-world?qt-news\\_science\\_products=0#qt-news\\_science\\_products](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-much-gold-has-been-found-world?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products) )\n* Every year 176 billion USD worth of gold is mined, adding to the \\~ 10 trillion that already exist. Meaning in 10 years the market cap of gold would be around worth 12 trillion USD. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54230737](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54230737))\n* **Gold will stay relevant**, living side by side to Bitcoin. Why? Humanity has been mining Gold for around 5000 years. What are the chances that it is gonna stay around for the next 50-100 years? Pretty high chances I\u2019d say (source:[ https://geology.com/usgs/gold](https://geology.com/usgs/gold/))\n* It\u2019s only available on Toronto Stock Exchange which makes it a bit harder to acquire. In this environment of only Pump and Dumps, this stock has remained hidden for now, adding crazy value with relatively small price movement.\n* Shares float is only 78.6 million. This company hasn't seen its shares get diluted like crazy in the past and it's unlikely to happen.\n* Insiders have been piling up shares. Last years, insiders owned 7.5M$ worth of equity, now they own 18,3M$, more than doubling. Yahoo finance indicates 43.5% of shares are held by insiders. This means they believe strongly in the product.\n* The CEO was a geologist before starting Goldspot Discoveries. (very interesting speech from the CEO, 7 minutes long:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyZSLuM0AoE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyZSLuM0AoE))\n* Highly competent team made of mostly M.Sc and Ph.D. Their CTO has over 11 publications in the field.\n* It\u2019s not on Stocktwits or finviz.com yet. Which generally I would say is a negative thing (that\u2019s why I will list it under \u201ccons\u201d as well). But in this case I actually think it\u2019s good because we\u2019re coming from a huge Pump and Dump phase and I do like that there is not much exposure yet.\n\n**Cons**\n\n* I don\u2019t know who managed the Stock Ticker name of Goldspot, but it has **multiple stock ticker names**: V.SPOT, SPOT.V, GDDCF. Which is a bit confusing, but they\u2019re all the same. G.SPOT would\u2019ve been so much easier.\n* **Small Market Cap and less discoverability**.\n* Highly dependable on their **success rate of discovering Gold occurrences** and other resources. ([ https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GDDCF/key-statistics?p=GDDCF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GDDCF/key-statistics?p=GDDCF)). Then again, a company's value depending on the value they actually produce is not necessarily bad.\n* **Trading volume has an average of 186k**, which is not a lot yet. Probably because it is only available on Toronto Stock Exchange so far. ( [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPOT.V/key-statistics?p=SPOT.V](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPOT.V/key-statistics?p=SPOT.V) ). However, with the last earnings, it has increased to an average of 480k.\n* Trading on Canadian Stock exchange might costs fees. You have to evaluate if it\u2019s worth for you.\n* Not on Stocktwits and finviz.com yet.\n* People might like the idea of resource exploration and try to found their own AI / Data Science company. So far the only other real competitor I have identified is Minerva intelligence, but they are much more speculative and fragile as a company.\n* Not available on e.g. Robinhood yet. Hopefully it will get listed on more brokers soon.\n\nRecent and short term catalysts\n\n* Literally today (April 14, 2021) they announced another partnership with TRU Precious metal corp in Newfoundland Canada.\n* In 2021, they announced helping 3 different mining companies find gold (actual results!) and have been hired by 4 others. These guys keep getting new partnerships\n* The CEO has recently said in an interview that they are working on getting the stock on RobinHood and other traders. This would take the stock out of the metaphorical suburb of Canadian stock market and move it to the big city.\n* Just this week the stock has been added to wealthsimple when it briefly went over 0,50$C/share\n* Earnings announcement of Q1 2021 in the beginning on May 21 2021. Q4 earnings already showed great growth. If they keep the same rythm, they'll exceed expected earnings yet again\n\nLong term catalysts/ the next step\n\n* Marketing the company to mining corps outside of North America. Much of Goldspot's business is done in Canada so far, but as a cloud-based service company, they aren't limited by geographical constraints. Their next targets are Australia and Asia.\n* Extension of the software and service to other materials/metals. The team has mentioned this is among their next steps, but there isn't a fixed calendar for this\n* R&amp;D. Lots of it. Goldspot has 17M invested in developing over 40 products. I cannot guarantee that all their products are going to deliver or be impactful, but this is a company that strives to keep innovating and will stay relevant in the future.\n* They started acquiring their own junior mining companies to direct their own exploration. They acquired Golden Planet Mining last year, which then saw 1600% gains in 4 months...\n\nEnd of DD disclaimer\n\n* Please do your own research.\n* At least type the name into Google once.",

Despite this, Discord was recently in the news again for banning NSFW servers from IOS.

I believe the ladder as Discord is definitely looking to get money ASAP but hasn't announced anything. In my opinion it'd be worth while to buy MSFT. It'd also might be worth while to hold on to the stock a bit longer while Microsoft would move Discord's server hosting to MS Azure hence strengthening their own platform.

Copper, as a key component of the global economic engine, could see strong demand from the construction and manufacturing industries as the global economy recovers. Considering the world\u2019s ambitious infrastructure plans, coupled with clean energy technologies, and pent-up demand for electric vehicles. As a result of this, copper miners will be forced to drastically cut back on operations! But the question is, is there anything to mine? \n\nWe all know there will never be a deficiency of copper. Since only approximately 1.1 trillion pounds (approximately 13.6 percent) of the world's inventory of this important and valuable metal has ever been mined.

        "selftext": "With some of the COVID trends we're seeing now I am worried about a potential stock market crash and want to see what others think.\n\nDr. Michael Osterholm of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy has been warning about emerging COVID strains for the past few weeks, particularly the B117 variant. Here is his most recent podcast episode on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnQ5v2Sf6A\n\nBasically, we are seeing [very high COVID case growths](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) in some U.S. states and also several countries which have travel between the US. This B117 strain is apparently significantly more infectious and potentially more deadly than the original, and spreads more rapidly in children. And just today the [CDC announced that the B117 strain is now the dominant strain in the US.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/07/us/uk-variant-dominant-coronavirus-strain/index.html) We are seeing a large uptick in cases in Michigan, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Maine, and parts of the midwest, seemingly due to the B117 strain. In terms of other countries, cases are spreading like wildfire in Canada, India, parts of South America, Germany, and various other countries throughout the world. \n\nThe biggest problem for the US? We're actually in a *more* vulnerable position than many of the other countries, since we are currently in the process of relaxing COVID restrictions. What about vaccines? [You may have heard that about 30% of the US is vaccinated.](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) This number is actually the percent who have received at least one dose, not necessarily fully vaccinated as the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require 2 doses for full protection. The real number is lower, at under 20%. While vaccine eligibility being opened up to those 16 and older may sound like a good thing, there is also a hidden downside: making the vaccine available to everyone could be a sign that states are not able to get enough people in vulnerable populations vaccinated, so they need to use the doses before expiration.\n\nThis all seems like a perfect storm and that the U.S. is about to get fucked by the B117 variants. Osterholm warned that schools may begin closing down again due to high infectivity in children, and it stands to reason this would happen with businesses too. I am worried these developments could cause the economy to begin shutting down again/travel be restricted as well, causing another stock market crash, though probably not as bad as last year's. Thoughts?\n\ntl;dr\n\n1. COVID cases rising rapidly in parts of the U.S. due to B117 variant, which appears to be more infectious and deadly\n\n2. Other countries which have lots of travel with the U.S. are also seeing rapid case growth\n\n3. The vaccination numbers are not nearly as promising as they seem at first glance",

        "selftext": " **In today\u2019s post I\u2019m going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio &amp; much more!**\n\n**\\[Disclaimer: Long Post\\]**\n\nFolks, we\u2019ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields &amp; inflations scares from boohoo \u201csuits\u201d that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.\n\n[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon &amp; a couple of other stocks.\n\nI believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE\u2019s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE\u2019s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon &amp; others.\n\nSmall-caps &amp; value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE\u2019s as well due to the recent \u201cbooming economy\u201d helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.\n\nJust take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) &amp; you can see that small &amp; mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid &amp; small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% &amp; 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow &amp; SP500.\n\nGuys, let\u2019s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:\n\n**1.** **Inflation &amp; Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**\n\nMy short answer is **NO**. I don\u2019t think the massive stimulus packages &amp; other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe &amp; the US.\n\nThough you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package &amp; proposed infrastructure bill.\n\nMost of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED &amp; mostly everyone is already expecting this.\n\nOn the other hand, if by any miracle, we don\u2019t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks &amp; especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.\n\n[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn\u2019t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy &amp; given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.\n\nIt\u2019s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.\n\n**2. FED Rates.**\n\nSo, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.\n\nRight [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.\n\nThe [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.\n\nThe dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)\u2026 just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.\n\nIt\u2019s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).\n\nWe can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.\n\nThis will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.\n\n**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**\n\nWe have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week.\n\nNonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%.\n\nIt\u2019s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.\n\nThe 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.\n\n[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure &amp; hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.\n\n**4. Suez Canal blockage**\n\n[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it\u2019s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.\n\n**5.** **EVs**\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.\n\n[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.\n\nThough I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper &amp; cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 &amp; model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla &amp; their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.\n\nEVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it\u2019s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.\n\n**6.** **Economic Readings**\n\nThe consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven\u2019t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices &amp; inflation possibilities.\n\nThe [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it\u2019s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.\n\n**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**\n\nLike in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn\u2019t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with my investment\u201d. That\u2019s exactly what we see during the optimism &amp; euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can\u2019t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation &amp; discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.\n\nWell I think we\u2019ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech &amp; small-cap stocks, with CNN\u2019s Fear &amp; Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.\n\nThat\u2019s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.\n\nThese were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless &amp; unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.\n\nExpect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. Labor Department\u2019s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute\u2019s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLiterally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We\u2019re coming off a low base,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks \u2014 unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n&gt; # All eyes on earnings\n&gt; \u201cThe macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. \u201cThat will be the next thing to turn to.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApproximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,\u201d noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2\u00bd\u20133% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,\u201d Golub wrote.\n*****\n&gt; # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that\u2019s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cApril is usually good. It\u2019s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It\u2019s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.\n*****\n&gt; The market enters the \u201csell in May\u201d period during the second quarter. The market adage, \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,\u201d Stovall said. \u201cTech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; The producer price index \u2014 which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output \u2014 will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC\u2019s Sara Eisen.\n*****\n&gt; Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/W5VnHdw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OWAqXe4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/seUECBP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/8x71bbA.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/B0iQJ5r.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/walbCuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pBIopWq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mZ6A4CJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H4WjcRK.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5iiOoya.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Mx4A08w.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JR37Qxb.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EHPQCzz.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks Love April\n\n&gt; \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n&gt; What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year.

Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It\u2019s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie\u2014a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n&gt; \u201cFew on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cEven though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a \u2018what have you done for me lately\u2019 industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.\u201d\n\n&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Inflation\n\n&gt; As we continue LPL Research\u2019s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow\u2019s blog, where we\u2019ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that\u2019s under control is a tailwind for stocks,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIt is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.\u201d\n\n&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The inflation question is one that isn\u2019t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn\u2019t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 2nd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.4.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd1mS00Cw_E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$SCHN** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$DCT** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$RGP** \n&gt; * **$PLUS** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MAXN** \n&gt; * **$EVAX** \n&gt; * **$MITO** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$JFIN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EFoYhPI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n( NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LGaokuS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eu0hmtC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RuFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9506N2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2URCkYe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hcSTJcm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ2s00r.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wEoA0Ew.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.9.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdchFK4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Paychex, Inc. $98.76\n**Paychex, Inc.

Upon closing, Proterra\u2019s common stock is expected to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol PTRA. The transaction represents an enterprise value of $1.6 billion for Proterra.\n\n**Diversified Provider of EV Technologies**\n\nProterra is a high-growth commercial electric vehicle technology leader with over a decade of production experience. The Company has designed an end-to-end, flexible technology platform that delivers world-class performance and a low total cost of ownership to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and end customers. Proterra has three complementary businesses:\n\n* **Proterra Powered**: Delivering industry-leading battery systems and electrification solutions to commercial vehicle manufacturers;\n* **Proterra Transit:** Leading North America as the market\u2019s #1 electric transit bus OEM; and\n* **Proterra Energy:** Offering end-to-end turnkey charging and energy management solutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s industry-leading battery systems have been proven in more than 16 million service miles driven by its fleet of transit vehicles and validated through partnerships with world-class commercial vehicle OEMs, such as Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC), Thomas Built Buses, Van Hool, Bustech, and Optimal-EV. To date, Proterra has produced and delivered more than 300 megawatt-hours of battery systems, more than 550 heavy-duty electric transit buses and installed 54 megawatts of charging systems.\n\nProterra operates manufacturing facilities in California and South Carolina, as well as a state-of-the-art R&amp;D lab in Silicon Valley. The Company recently announced the opening of a new battery production line co-located in its electric transit bus manufacturing facility in Los Angeles County.

In addition, it introduces a partner in ArcLight that has a shared focus on sustainability and renewable energy.

(Nasdaq: NGAC) (\"NextGen\"), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, announced today that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement that will result in Xos becoming a publicly listed company. The combined company is expected to be traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under \u201cXOS\u201d.\n\nDakota Semler, Co-Founder and CEO of Xos, stated, \u201cIn 2016, my co-founder and I set out to build a company whose mission was to decarbonize transportation through the design, engineering and development of purpose-built commercial vehicles. Our aim was to provide customers a superior alternative to traditional fossil fuel vehicles. As former fleet operators, we gained a deep appreciation for the challenges of operating and maintaining commercial fleets, particularly in light of accelerating emissions requirements. Xos developed its technology and product portfolio in close collaboration with established fleet operators who have provided invaluable ongoing feedback that has informed every aspect of our vehicle design, product engineering, commercial manufacturing and service strategy. As a result, we have developed commercial EV solutions that uniquely incorporate customer requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince 2019, we have had vehicles on the road and in the hands of our customers, which include UPS, Wiggins, Lonestar and Loomis, validating our durable and low-cost sustainable design. Today\u2019s announcement represents a major milestone that allows Xos to expand its vehicle and battery manufacturing capacity, advance our next generation battery and vehicle control systems, and put thousands more Xos vehicles on the road,\u201d said Xos\u2019 Co-Founder and COO, Giordano Sordoni.\n\nXos developed its vehicles to meet the demands and extended life cycles of last-mile, on-highway and vocational vehicles. Xos believes it is well positioned to capitalize on the electrification of the $100 billion total addressable market for medium- and heavy-duty last-mile commercial electric vehicles. The Company\u2019s more than 6,000-unit backlog of contracted and optional orders underscores robust market opportunities for Xos\u2019 vehicle products.\n\nDemand in the last-mile commercial EV market is expected to grow at a 35% CAGR through 2040 as electric vehicles replace traditional fossil fuel vehicles, driven by new emissions standards, continued growth of e-commerce and the relocation of fulfillment centers to areas closer to consumers. Xos\u2019 trucks are powered by its proprietary technology, developed to meet the needs of commercial fleets, and designed to achieve a TCO that is lower than traditional fossil fuel vehicles and other electric vehicle alternatives.\n\nThe Company offers Fleet-as-a-Service\u2013a bundled package that provides vehicle ownership services to fleet operators for a fixed monthly fee\u2014in coordination with partners such as DLL Group (financing services) and Dickinson Fleet Services (vehicle maintenance). The Fleet-as-a-Service package aggregates otherwise fragmented fleet service offerings and is projected to significantly increase Xos\u2019 lifetime revenue per vehicle.\n\n\"The strong secular tailwinds of climate change and e-commerce anchor our investment conviction in Xos,\" said George Mattson, Co-Founder and Co-Chairman of NextGen. \"Climate change is one of the world\u2019s greatest challenges, and commercial trucks are the largest emitters per capita of greenhouse gases in the transportation industry. Simultaneously, last-mile ecommerce delivery is growing, accelerated by changes in consumer purchasing behaviors post- COVID. The dual drivers of strong underlying industry growth and the imperative to transition traditional fossil fuel vehicles to zero emission vehicles, set the backdrop for strong underlying growth for years to come. Xos has successfully commercialized its cost competitive proprietary product offering and is now poised to scale delivery of its customer-validated vehicles with the growth capital that NextGen will provide.\"\n\n\u201cNextGen reviewed over a hundred potential merger opportunities and conducted in-depth evaluations of several companies in the EV and automotive technology sectors,\u201d added Gregory Summe, Co-Founder and Co-Chairman of NextGen. \u201cBased on our work, we believe that Xos is best-positioned to capture the rapidly growing demand for commercial electrical vehicles with a compelling customer offering. We look forward to working with Xos' leadership team by providing strategic, operating and governance experience to help Xos realize its vision of decarbonizing commercial transportation.\"\n\nIn addition to Dakota Semler and Giordano Sordoni, Xos will continue to be led by its existing management team including Chief Technology Officer, Robert Ferber, and Chief Financial Officer, Kingsley Afemikhe.\n\n## Transaction Overview\n\nThe business combination values the combined company at a $2.0 billion pro forma equity value, at a price of $10.00 per NextGen share and assuming no redemptions by NextGen shareholders. The transaction will provide $575 million of gross proceeds to the company, assuming no redemptions, including a $220 million oversubscribed and fully committed common stock PIPE at $10.00 per share anchored by Janus Henderson Investors, as well as a consortium of truck dealers led by Thompson Truck Centers.\n\nThe boards of directors of both Xos and NextGen have each unanimously approved the proposed business combination, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021, subject to, among other things, the approval by NextGen\u2019s shareholders of the business combination, the concurrent PIPE transaction, satisfaction of the conditions stated in the definitive agreement and other customary closing conditions, including that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) completes its review of the registration statement on Form S-4 and the proxy statement/prospectus, the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and approval by The Nasdaq Stock Market to list the securities of the combined company.\n\n## Advisors\n\nBofA Securities is serving as exclusive financial advisor to Xos, and Cooley LLP is serving as legal advisor to Xos.

(\u201cthe Company\u201d or \u201cSoFi\u201d), a leading next-generation financial services platform, has entered into a definitive agreement with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V (\u201cSCH\u201d) (NYSE: IPOE), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, to bring a major consumer-focused financial technology business to the public markets. The transaction values the Company at an equity value of $8.65 billion post-money.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nSoFi is a member-centric, one-stop shop for financial services including loan refinancing, mortgages, personal loans, credit cards, insurance, investing and deposit accounts, that has allowed more than 1.8 million members to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money since its inception. SoFi\u2019s full suite of financial products offers members the speed, selection, content, and convenience that only an integrated digital platform can provide and allows them to manage their financial lives in one application, all on their phone.\n\nSoFi\u2019s consumer offering is augmented by its ownership and independent operation of Galileo, one of the leading providers of critical technology infrastructure services, including customer-facing and back-end capabilities, to fast-growing financial services providers. Galileo has approximately 50 million accounts on its platform.\n\nSoFi\u2019s consumer and enterprise businesses are highly complementary, enabling SoFi to provide faster product innovation and speed of service to both SoFi members and the customers of Galileo\u2019s clients. SoFi has experienced rapid acceleration with this strategy and has achieved six consecutive quarters of year-on-year member growth.\n\nSoFi received preliminary, conditional approval from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a national bank charter in October 2020. If SoFi obtains final regulatory approval to own a bank, it would have a lower cost of funds to further support SoFi\u2019s growth.\n\nSoFi delivered over $200 million in total net revenue in the third quarter of 2020 and is on track to generate approximately $1 billion of estimated adjusted net revenue in 2021, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 60 percent, and full-year adjusted EBITDA profitability.\n\nThe Company\u2019s world-class management team, led by CEO Anthony Noto, will continue to lead SoFi following the transaction.\u00a0\n\n**Management Comments**\n\n**Anthony Noto, Chief Executive Officer of SoFi said:**\n\n\u201cSoFi is on a mission to help people achieve financial independence to realize their ambitions. Our ecosystem of products, rewards, and membership benefits all work together to help our members get their money right**.** With the secular acceleration in digital-first financial services offerings, SoFi is the only company providing a comprehensive solution all in one app. The new investments and our partnership with Social Capital Hedosophia signify the confidence in our strategy, the momentum in our business, as well as the significant growth opportunity ahead of us. We look forward to helping more people get their money right in the years to come.\u201d\n\n**Chamath Palihapitiya, Founder and CEO of Social Capital Hedosophia V, said:**\n\n\u201cSoFi\u2019s innovative, member-first platform has demystified financial services for millions of Americans and simplified the process for those looking to apply for loans, invest their money, obtain insurance and refinance their debt, among many other tasks that were previously arcane and needlessly complicated.\u00a0 Additionally, the acceleration of cross-buying by existing SoFi members has created a virtuous cycle of compounding growth, diversified revenue and high profitability. We look forward to partnering with Anthony and his team as they help even more members to achieve financial independence.\u201d\n\n**Transaction Overview**\n\nThe transaction is expected to deliver up to $2.4 billion of gross proceeds to the combined company, including the contribution of up to $805 million of cash held in SCH\u2019s trust account from its initial public offering in October 2020. The combination is further supported by a $1.2 billion PIPE at $10 per share led by Chamath Palihapitiya, Founder and CEO of SCH, and Hedosophia, with commitments from funds and accounts managed by Altimeter Capital Management, Baron Capital Group, BlackRock, Coatue Management, Durable Capital Partners LP,\u00a0 and Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP). SoFi also received a previous anchor investment from funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.\u00a0\n\nExisting SoFi shareholders will roll 100 percent of their equity into the combined company. Concurrent with closing, $150 million of the transaction proceeds will be used for strategic secondary transactions that will help structure SoFi\u2019s pro forma capitalization table in a way that is more conducive to obtaining an OCC national bank charter. All references to available cash from the trust account and retained transaction proceeds are subject to any redemptions by the public shareholders of SCH and payment of transaction expenses.\u00a0\n\nThe transaction, which has been unanimously approved by SCH\u2019s board of directors and the independent directors of SoFi\u2019s board of directors, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, and is subject to approval by SCH\u2019s shareholders and other customary closing conditions, including any applicable regulatory approvals.\n\n**Advisors**\n\nConnaught acted as financial advisor, Credit Suisse acted as financial advisor, capital markets advisor and placement agent, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP acted as legal advisor to SCH.

This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or exchange, or the solicitation of an offer to buy or exchange, any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or exchange would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. SCH intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which will include a document that serves as a prospectus and proxy statement of SCH, referred to as a proxy statement/prospectus. A proxy statement/prospectus will be sent to all SCH shareholders. SCH also will file other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. Before making any voting decision, investors and security holders of SCH are urged to read the registration statement, the proxy statement/prospectus and all other relevant documents filed or that will be filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction as they become available because they will contain important information about the proposed transaction.\n\nInvestors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of the registration statement, the proxy statement/prospectus and all other relevant documents filed or that will be filed with the SEC by SCH through the website maintained by the SEC at[ www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov/).\u00a0\n\nThe documents filed by SCH with the SEC also may be obtained free of charge at SCH\u2019s website at [http://www.socialcapitalhedosophiaholdings.com/docse.html](http://www.socialcapitalhedosophiaholdings.com/docse.html) or upon written request to 317 University Ave, Suite 200, Palo Alto, California 94301\n\n**Participants in Solicitation**\n\nSCH and SoFi and their respective directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from SCH\u2019s shareholders in connection with the proposed transaction. A list of the names of such directors and executive officers and information regarding their interests in the business combination will be contained in the proxy statement/prospectus when available. You may obtain free copies of these documents as described in the preceding paragraph.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\u00a0\n\nSCH and SoFi and their respective directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from SCH\u2019s shareholders in connection with the proposed transaction. A list of the names of such directors and executive officers and information regarding their interests in the business combination will be contained in the proxy statement/prospectus when available. You may obtain free copies of these documents as described in the preceding paragraph.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws with respect to the proposed transaction between SoFi and SCH. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201copportunity,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cwill be,\u201d \u201cwill continue,\u201d \u201cwill likely result,\u201d and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this document, including but not limited to: (i) the risk that the transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect the price of SCH\u2019s securities, (ii) the risk that the transaction may not be completed by SCH\u2019s business combination deadline and the potential failure to obtain an extension of the business combination deadline if sought by SCH, (iii) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the transaction, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the shareholders of SCH, the satisfaction of the minimum trust account amount following redemptions by SCH\u2019s public shareholders and the receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals, (iv) the lack of a third party valuation in determining whether or not to pursue the proposed transaction, (v) the inability to complete the PIPE Investment, (vi) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement, (vii) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the transaction on SoFi\u2019s business relationships, operating results, and business generally, (viii) risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations of SoFi and potential difficulties in SoFi employee retention as a result of the transaction, (ix) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against SoFi or against SCH related to the Merger Agreement or the proposed transaction, (x) the ability to maintain the listing of SCH\u2019s securities on a national securities exchange, (xi) the price of SCH\u2019s securities may be volatile due to a variety of factors, including changes in the competitive and highly regulated industries in which SCH plans to operate or SoFi operates, variations in operating performance across competitors, changes in laws and regulations affecting SCH\u2019s or SoFi\u2019s business and changes in the combined capital structure, (xii) the ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations after the completion of the proposed transaction, and identify and realize additional opportunities, and (xiii) the risk of downturns and a changing regulatory landscape in the highly competitive industry. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of SCH\u2019s registration on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-248915 and 333-249396), the registration statement on Form S-4 discussed above and other documents filed by SCH from time to time with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and SoFi and SCH assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Neither SoFi nor SCH gives any assurance that either SoFi or SCH, or the combined company, will achieve its expectations.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Related Information**\n\nThis press release references adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These non-GAAP financial measures do not have a standardized meaning, and the definition of adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA used by SoFi may be different from other, similarly named non-GAAP measures used by others. In addition, such financial information is unaudited and does not conform to SEC Regulation S-X and as a result such information may be presented differently in future filings by the Company with the SEC. Management uses forward-looking non-GAAP measures to evaluate SoFi\u2019s projected financials and operating performance. Certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures are presented without corresponding GAAP reconciliations due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations.       \n\nSource: [https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-plans-to-go-public](https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-plans-to-go-public)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhat are your guys' thoughts and opinions on these stocks?

        "selftext": " Hello Everyone,\n\nCurrently  the largest holding in my portfolio is Vicinity Motor Corp, you may  have heard of them previously as Grande West Transportation, but they  recently went through a name change to reflect what they do/closer  mirror the name of their buses. [https://ir.grandewest.com/](https://ir.grandewest.com/)\n\nSo  Vicinity Motor corp makes Buses - CNG, Diesel and Electric.  They are a  Canadian bus manufacturer who is now breaking into the US market and I  think they are posed for a breakout this year and into next year.\n\nI'll  start with giving some of the business moves that makes me extremely  confident with them and then move into financials and finish with risks  to the company\n\n**Business Moves for 2021**\n\nVicinity  is looking to break into the American market - they have a plant in  Washington state which is projected to be finished by Q4 of 2021 that is  buy America compliant.  They also have signed a deal with ABC companies  to distribute their buses and through that have roughly $15 million of  deals that have been signed for the second half of 2021.\n\nThey  have signed deals with both New Mexico and the State of Washington to  be an OEM supplier for the transit agencies for those states - both are  statewide contracts.  These deals do not make them an exclusive  supplier, but rather give the transit agencies the ability to buy their  buses from Vicinity.  If they can just get a fraction of these sales  then that will translate to a huge improvement in the revenue for the  company. They also mentioned in [This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTQTt6calg&amp;t=454s&amp;ab_channel=SmallcapDiscoveries)  that they are progressing in signing a deal with the state of  California, if signed that would be massive - they somewhat go through  the math, but it looks like the total deal would be up to 2.4 billion in  buses - obviously they wouldn't capture all of that, but if they get a  portion of that along with Washington and New Mexico, it would be  massive.\n\nNow the next big thing  they are doing is making electric buses.  At the moment, they do not  have any electric buses on the road. They are anticipating getting their  first 5 electric buses in June and will use them to Demo to potential  customers and run testing on to make sure that they are good and have no  issues.  Note that the last time they had Altoona testing done on their  buses they received best in class.\n\nLastly,  they are in a good position to capture both the Canadian and US  green/infrastructure bills. These are massive amounts of capital flowing  to bus companies and transit organizations - definitely a boon to the  company/the industry as a whole.\n\n**Financials:**\n\nThe  company has a couple of items on the financials that makes me very  bullish and a couple of forward looking items from their recent earnings  call which makes me very excited.\n\nStarting  with the Forward looking items - they have said they are going to have  roughly $50 Million of revenue in the first half of 2021.  That is  roughly double of the revenue in both 2019 and 2020.  I had mentioned  earlier that they have at least an additional $15 Million booked for  Q3/Q4 of this year.  Bringing up their booked revenue to $65 Million as  of April - and those do not include any money from the deals with  Washington and New Mexico. They also received an order for [5 electric buses from Tulane University](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/02/tulane-university-buys-5-vicinity-electric-shuttle-buses/) That would bring them up to most likely about 66.5 Million in revenue for the year that is booked through April.\n\nNow,  before the Q4 earnings were reported, I had one major worry with the  company - their cost of revenue.  I had listened to their Q3 earnings  call and heard that their gross margins would improve due to them  getting out of a deal where they were selling their buses for a  discount.  I wanted to see the impact of this and it was honestly pretty  staggering.  [Here are the Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BUSXD/financials?p=BUSXD)  now the Q4 gross margin includes an impairment of .7 Million. so I  threw that out to get a look at what forward gross margins would be and I  got 33.2%. That is roughly a 5-6X improvement over the previous  quarters - Q3 had a gross profit of 6.3% and 5.7% in Q2.  This is where  the real growth comes in for me - they not only are going to double  their revenue from the previous year in the first half of this year, it  is going to be at much better margins.  Now that would still have them  trading at a fairly generous amount to their forward EBITDA - roughly  about 20X but growing revenue by at least 2.5X YoY and then improving  gross margins by 5-6X makes me think they are still very undervalued -  especially with the incoming catalysts of a NASDAQ uplisting and their  electric buses hitting the market/the market realizing they make green  vehicles.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n* Currently,  it looks like the $50 million in revenue is from a single customer - at  least that is how I interpret it although that could be incorrect, so  they will need to work on building relationships with other entities as  this order and revenue from it dries up.\n* They  are trying to break into the American market, and while I see good  signs that they will, their small size and newness to the market may  scare some clients and also means that if they mess up anything they  could really be hurting\n* Speaking  of messing things up, their electric bus still has not passed testing  as that will happen in June.  I believe that it will pass with flying  colors based off of the results of their previous buses, but if it  doesn't for some reason they will be in a world of hurt.\n* Delays  in completing their American facility in Washington could cause them to  lose orders or have orders delayed which would cause their stock price  to drop.\n\nPositions:\n\nCurrently sitting at 1886 shares at an average price of $7.73 USD\n\n[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/XsViZOM)",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: Sus wants OCC to act as its personal insurance/rainy day account in the event they get caught at the Casino betting more than the house. They are avoiding margin call just as much as Citadel. If 003 passes, they not only get margin called along with Citadel, they are subject to the exact same panty raid that will befall Kenny and all his belongings in his golden kingdom. Sus only has a kingdom on paper, and as long as the rules stand as currently written. If you change the rules, they are no longer players in the game. Their comment seeks to stop that.\n\nIn the hours and days following my post [Susquehanna is Sus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/mli9vf/susquehanna_is_sus_the_missing_michael_burrys/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) going up, we have learned, in short, that they are [V sus.](http://imgur.com/a/EzZB2vv) \n\nThen I read the Susquehanna International Group comments on SR-OCC-2021-801 \ud83e\uddd0 Which was [passed today.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/occ/2021/34-91491.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiQxrPNvu3vAhVbbc0KHQzvAXYQFjAAegQIBxAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw3XnWmA5OCyUF1ZoToM3B8L)\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about OCC 801 first. What it *DOESN\u2019T* do is margin call anybody. Let\u2019s be clear about that. The margin call rule is the **NSCC**801. The 801 of today is not a standalone catalyst. What it *does* do is open for discussion the rule (003) that will build a firewall of protection around OCC\u2019s other members; i.e. protection from the flames of a burning hedgie(s). \n\nMembers of the OCC pay into a community pot. If any player gets sent directly to jail, the OCC draws from this free parking loot bag and pays up the damages, as a hedge of protections and form of insurance for all the \u201cinnocent\u201d members. OCC is the custodian of this account.\n\nNow, members still have access to however much they\u2019ve contributed to this pot, but what SR-OCC-2021-004 does, is starts talking about an auction process for liquidating Kenny boy\u2019s assets to pay his debts instead of pulling from OCC funds first, which is a big statement. That, in my opinion, will be the catalyst.\n\nOk so I\u2019m getting sidetracked. We came here to shit talk Susquehanna. \n\nThey commented on 801, but what they really decided to bitch about was SR-OCC-2021-003.\n\nBut... I thought we were talking about OCC-801? Why moar numbers??? \ud83d\ude2d\n\nBecause think of it this way. OCC-801 is Pikachu. OCC-003 is [Raichu](http://imgur.com/a/Z5d1tH9). So 801 is the first evolution of the rule. (Which was approved today!) The middle of this evolution is the discovery period wherein the public can make comments. THIS IS WHERE SUS COMES IN. And eventually the evolution completes with the passing of rule 003/Raichu. This is extremely generalized but you get the idea. The fact that Sus commented on 801 means that 003 is now delayed until May 31 (*DO NOT GIVE A SECOND THOUGHT TO THIS DATE OUTSIDE OF ITS INTENDED MEANING*). This rule was set to automatically take effect in April.\n\nSo Susquehanna International Group filed a comment on 801. That means the train is fucking halted until the issues raised are addressed. What are the issues raised? I won\u2019t bore you with their unnecessarily big words. Basically; \n\nSus wants OCC shareholders to get burned the worst and carry most the consequences (and pay the repercussions) in the event of a member default, instead of the member themselves being the one burned to the ground. Remember that free parking pot of money? Sus claims that violates one of OCC\u2019s rule - 17A(b)(3)(F)- and pretty much is under-regulated and carries too much incentive for the OCC to keep in the current account, as is. (Essentially saying it becomes a net positive on their books, thus benefitting the shareholders by making the OCC appear more fiscally valuable on paper.) Sus claims the money should rightfully be moved to a more restricted, controlled account, which does not contribute to the OCC books, and only pays out in the event of a member default. \n\nThis comment is a desperate attempt to find issue where there should be none. They attempt to pin it on the fact that SLDs would raise the fees per transaction. What they\u2019re really saying if you read between the lines is, please don\u2019t pass this rule. If you pass this, we r fuk 2.\n\nAll this comment did was perhaps bring about a minor amendment to 003 before its passing. It also kicked that can down the road to May 31 before it will automatically pass, but I have no doubt it will enact much sooner. OCC is lining up their hedge of protection from the hedgie fire by approving the rules in this way. They are literally building a moat around their castle. \n\n\n**Remember the scene in the Big Short where Dr. Burry is trying to exit his positions but the bank won\u2019t call him back for days because they are setting themselves up a lifeboat before allowing anyone else on. This is precisely what we are witnessing now.**",

        "selftext": "This Post is on Sunday, April 17, 2021. \n\nMiddle of last week I posted about not seeing much in the way of top forming yet. I wanted to come back and briefly share a couple other things I have seen since then. First, when I look at the block buying on the $SPY and the inbound flows (both money and volume)...I don't remember seeing such strong readings in a long time. This is technically even stronger than November impulse move up (which is crazy to even think about). This very strong under the surface money and volume flow (and blocks) could either be the beginnings of large distributive activity (where institutions are starting to unload mass inventory into strength at high price levels) OR it could be a very aggressively bought bullish move from retail, institutions, and passive ETFs that targets $440-450 area...like a melt-up/blow off chase.\n\n[$SPY 1 day chart \\(look at the 3rd frame - so much volume, money, and block flow\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xoxbih519tt61.png?width=1906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9c62f39b958cb00c895708e8c8d623040d97f6c)\n\nLooking at Gamma for $SPY - even with OPEX rolling off on Friday - it is still really positive. If this doesn't change on Mon/Tues this will keep providing the BTFD intraday bid we see in these punishing rallies.  I would watch this Mon/Tues to see if there is much roll off. \n\n[$SPY GEX - all strikes\\/all expiries out 180 days](https://preview.redd.it/k72fubqb9tt61.png?width=1906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52a99170cfa3f0500befd0946180d7c11c904768)\n\nIf you drill into the $SPY largest options contracts on Friday 4/16 its predominantly bullish\n\n[$SPY largest options P\\/C Treemap by contract ](https://preview.redd.it/vnw51c37att61.png?width=1906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d56f9df57764bddf35147262de0245804e4b54ee)\n\nAs of Friday 4/16, it was pretty much what I expected - that it would continue to be pounded with more puts. Having said that, these put strikes are even further out on the calendar which shows the short vol players aggression and expectations. Most of these were with high energy (so they were ask/above ask) and VIXpiration is on Wednesday this coming week though so it will be interesting to see if this starts to shift ahead of/after that. \n\n[$VIX largest options P\\/C treemap by contract](https://preview.redd.it/rzqz8jyv9tt61.png?width=1906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=849d6c43622523e5de494e731e0f7ddabadc177f)\n\nOne thing that was sticking out a little that I did see again on Friday is deeper OTM $VIX call buying. This can easily be hedging, but it also could be speculating and front running a potential turn. But one day needs to turn into 2-3 straight days of this type of call buying to get my attention. Until then, it is just worth keeping an eye on to see if it is consistent early this week.\n\n[Most Unusual Deep OTM Calls on Friday 4\\/16](https://preview.redd.it/hfqq7ww3btt61.png?width=1906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae03328eab0d1e8a5b5618700e7415ab7604456b)\n\nWhen I look at the big great white sharks index - the $SPX - it is also very much in control by the call buyers...look at the top 20 or so calls (largest volume with most unusual activity compared to the last 10 trading days)...not bearish with a lot of longer dated expirations that were purchased with high energy (when I looked into them - i.e. towards the ask or above ask). \n\n[$SPX calls ](https://preview.redd.it/ohgvbk2sbtt61.png?width=1906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06fa7be5e63aad3043b568cf541f12f17f0499b0)\n\nHere is the overall put/call picture on Friday for $SPX...with over $7b changing hands.\n\n[$SPX put\\/call visualization of largest contracts - lots of calls](https://preview.redd.it/ru7aqlc3ctt61.png?width=1906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=987f7338b78d34c1386ae4cb9c00aa0c96b49382)\n\nI could dig into Small Caps and Momo Stocks and FAANGs and Crypto (\\**as of close Friday which was before the weekend action*) and PMs, but I won't waste your time b/c they all look the same. Bulls appear to be firmly in control at the moment. The positioning that takes place up to and after VIXpiration this coming week is important to monitor but I think I mentioned this before, but if not here it is again: what I see usually is that in the absence of volatility in today's markets, all you really get is a bunch of expensive - to - cheap rotation. So unless VIX positioning changes (which should show up here first) ... you have to expect upside and rotations. If VIX positioning changes, then be on the lookout for a shift. What could trigger a shift? \n\nWell, one thing I am watching early in the week too is the Crypto impact that the risk-off action that started last night from the India (starting to outlaw the ownership of Cryptocurrencies) news and also the US Treasury news where Yellen has notated that she is charging some \"institutions with Money Laundering via Crypto\". The Crypto market has grown in such size that Crypto-related stock names (V, SQ, PYPL, TSLA, MARA, MSTR) are regularly among the top 50 most volume traded option tickers daily. Any impact to BTC and the other Crypto's could spill into the indexes themselves (just based on the indexation that these names now represent inside ETFs especially how tethered $TSLA has become to Crypto action and how large $TSLA options market is...its larger than $SPY/$QQQ/$IWM every day). IF there was risk-off in crypto it could have a broader effect than say the Hwang situation from a few weeks back. The Hwang situation was bad, but it is a drop in the bucket to how large the Crypto space has become. It is still too early to say if this news from India and the US Treasury has any longer term impacts or whether its a nothing-burger that is BTFD time again. I have no opinion on that...will wait to see what happens...but its definitely worth paying attention too as VIXpiration comes Wednesday and in the great white shark indexes ($VIX and $SPX) is where I generally see a shift because of VEX and GEX changes due to expiration roll off with how large, liquid, and derivative impacting those two markets are.\n\nI will swing back through after VIXpiration this week to see how this is all shaking out.

        "selftext": "So it appears the new cdc guidelines are out and they are just as pathetic as I predicted. They mention that vaccines will be an important part of returning to normal, they are still demanding that the cruise industry perform test cruises before they can set sail with any paying customers and no date for return to cruising from US ports was given. That meeting with Florida's politicians the other day was a waste of time.  This CDC update just creates more barriers for the cruise industry to sail out of US ports.  I am posting various links below with more information.\n\n[https://www.cruisehive.com/no-test-sailings-yet-and-no-clear-dates-from-cdc/49166](https://www.cruisehive.com/no-test-sailings-yet-and-no-clear-dates-from-cdc/49166)\n\nFrom the above article:\n\n \"As it stands currently, the new guidelines that the CDC has issued do not speed up a return of cruising anytime soon. The cruise lines have no guidance on when they would start test cruises; there is no guidance on restart dates.\n\nAlthough we knew that phase two would always only be some additional technical guidance from the CDC, what they have released now seems to be disappointing for everyone in the cruise industry.\"\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfY0Y5qZQYo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfY0Y5qZQYo)\n\nThe above link is a travel agent who deals with cruises.

        "selftext": "**In today\u2019s post I\u2019m going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio &amp; much more!**\n\n**\\[Disclaimer: Long Post\\]**\n\nFolks, we\u2019ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields &amp; inflations scares from boohoo \u201csuits\u201d that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.\n\n[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon &amp; a couple of other stocks.\n\nI believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE\u2019s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE\u2019s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon &amp; others.\n\nSmall-caps &amp; value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE\u2019s as well due to the recent \u201cbooming economy\u201d helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.\n\nJust take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) &amp; you can see that small &amp; mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid &amp; small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% &amp; 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow &amp; SP500.\n\nGuys, let\u2019s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:\n\n**1.** **Inflation &amp; Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**\n\nMy short answer is **NO**. I don\u2019t think the massive stimulus packages &amp; other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe &amp; the US.\n\nThough you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package &amp; proposed infrastructure bill.\n\nMost of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED &amp; mostly everyone is already expecting this. \n\nOn the other hand, if by any miracle, we don\u2019t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks &amp; especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.\n\n[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn\u2019t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy &amp; given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.\n\nIt\u2019s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.\n\n**2. FED Rates.** \n\nSo, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.\n\nRight [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.\n\nThe [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.\n\nThe dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)\u2026 just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.\n\nIt\u2019s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).\n\nWe can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.\n\nThis will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.\n\n**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**\n\nWe have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week. \n\nNonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%. \n\nIt\u2019s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.\n\nThe 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.\n\n[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure &amp; hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.\n\n**4. Suez Canal blockage** \n\n[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it\u2019s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.\n\n**5.** **EVs**\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.\n\n[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.\n\nThough I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper &amp; cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 &amp; model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla &amp; their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.\n\nEVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it\u2019s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.\n\n**6.** **Economic Readings**\n\nThe consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven\u2019t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices &amp; inflation possibilities.\n\nThe [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it\u2019s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.\n\n**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**\n\nLike in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn\u2019t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with my investment\u201d. That\u2019s exactly what we see during the optimism &amp; euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can\u2019t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation &amp; discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.\n\nWell I think we\u2019ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech &amp; small-cap stocks, with CNN\u2019s Fear &amp; Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.\n\nThat\u2019s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.\n\nThese were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless &amp; unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.\n\nExpect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

Think about how paranoid people are about their phone \"always listening to them\". Think about Snowden and the NSA's surveillance. This is the level of tech that we are talking about here. \n\nThis company isn't something like Google AdSense. This is some next-level shit.

After his daughter was sent various coupons for new or expecting mothers, the girl's father expressed his distaste for Target, thinking they were attempting to coax her into teen pregnancy. As it turns out, his daughter was ACTUALLY PREGNANT and didn't tell her father.\n\nThat is the power of statistical data analytics right there.\n\nPalantir is not \"involved in too many sectors\".

        "selftext": "This is my first DD, so take it easy on me!\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nPatriot Gold Corp. (stock symbol: $PGOL) is a gold and silver company with a focus on Nevada and Arizona. The Moss Mine project, in which they own a 3% royalty is in commercial production. The Bruner gold project, in which they own a 2% royalty has delivered outstanding drill results and had a preliminary economic assessment carried out. Their wholly-owned Windy Peak, Rainbow Mountain and Vernal gold projects are all early stage.\n\nThe companies common stock trades on the CSE and OTC markets under the symbol $PGOL.\n\nThe price at the time of writing (15/04) is $0.1292 per share.\n\nThis stock has been on the OTCQB market since 2014; To be eligible for OTCQB, companies must be current in their financial reporting, undergo an annual verification and management certification process, and have a bid price of at least $0.01. They also cannot be in bankruptcy.\n\n**HOW IT MADE IT ON TO MY WATCHLIST**\n\n$PGOL just posted their late 10-K: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001080448/000168316821001392/patriotgold\\_10k-123120.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001080448/000168316821001392/patriotgold_10k-123120.htm)\n\n**FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**\n\nIn 2004, the company obtained a 100% interest in a number of patented and unpatented mining claims known as the Moss Mine property and in 2016 mining claims were sold to Golden Vertex Corp for $1.16M plus a 3% net smelter return (NPR) royalty.\n\nDuring 2020 and 2019, they had revenues of $2.47M and $1.31M respectively, resulting from the aforementioned Moss royalty (88% increase).\n\nNet income for 2020 was $2.03M compared to net income of $240K for 2019, for an approximate $1.79M increase in net income (8.45x increase). The increase in the net income is primarily due to the $1.16M increase of royalty revenue received from the Moss Mine (4.83x increase), as a result of the Moss Mine\u2019s increase in gold/silver production.

        "selftext": " Hello Everyone,\n\nCurrently   the largest holding in my portfolio is Vicinity Motor Corp, you may   have heard of them previously as Grande West Transportation, but they   recently went through a name change to reflect what they do/closer   mirror the name of their buses. [https://ir.grandewest.com/](https://ir.grandewest.com/)\n\nSo   Vicinity Motor corp makes Buses - CNG, Diesel and Electric.  They are a   Canadian bus manufacturer who is now breaking into the US market and I   think they are posed for a breakout this year and into next year.\n\nI'll   start with giving some of the business moves that makes me extremely   confident with them and then move into financials and finish with risks   to the company\n\n**Business Moves for 2021**\n\nVicinity   is looking to break into the American market - they have a plant in   Washington state which is projected to be finished by Q4 of 2021 that is   buy America compliant.  They also have signed a deal with ABC  companies  to distribute their buses and through that have roughly $15  million of  deals that have been signed for the second half of 2021.\n\nThey   have signed deals with both New Mexico and the State of Washington to   be an OEM supplier for the transit agencies for those states - both are   statewide contracts.  These deals do not make them an exclusive   supplier, but rather give the transit agencies the ability to buy their   buses from Vicinity.  If they can just get a fraction of these sales   then that will translate to a huge improvement in the revenue for the   company. They also mentioned in [This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTQTt6calg&amp;t=454s&amp;ab_channel=SmallcapDiscoveries)   that they are progressing in signing a deal with the state of   California, if signed that would be massive - they somewhat go through   the math, but it looks like the total deal would be up to 2.4 billion in   buses - obviously they wouldn't capture all of that, but if they get a   portion of that along with Washington and New Mexico, it would be   massive.\n\nNow the next big thing   they are doing is making electric buses.  At the moment, they do not   have any electric buses on the road. They are anticipating getting their   first 5 electric buses in June and will use them to Demo to potential   customers and run testing on to make sure that they are good and have  no  issues.  Note that the last time they had Altoona testing done on  their  buses they received best in class.\n\nLastly,   they are in a good position to capture both the Canadian and US   green/infrastructure bills. These are massive amounts of capital flowing   to bus companies and transit organizations - definitely a boon to the   company/the industry as a whole.\n\n**Financials:**\n\nThe   company has a couple of items on the financials that makes me very   bullish and a couple of forward looking items from their recent earnings   call which makes me very excited.\n\nStarting   with the Forward looking items - they have said they are going to have   roughly $50 Million of revenue in the first half of 2021.  That is   roughly double of the revenue in both 2019 and 2020.  I had mentioned   earlier that they have at least an additional $15 Million booked for   Q3/Q4 of this year.  Bringing up their booked revenue to $65 Million as   of April - and those do not include any money from the deals with   Washington and New Mexico. They also received an order for [5 electric buses from Tulane University](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/02/tulane-university-buys-5-vicinity-electric-shuttle-buses/) That would bring them up to most likely about 66.5 Million in revenue for the year that is booked through April.\n\nNow,   before the Q4 earnings were reported, I had one major worry with the   company - their cost of revenue.  I had listened to their Q3 earnings   call and heard that their gross margins would improve due to them   getting out of a deal where they were selling their buses for a   discount.  I wanted to see the impact of this and it was honestly pretty   staggering.  [Here are the Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BUSXD/financials?p=BUSXD)   now the Q4 gross margin includes an impairment of .7 Million. so I   threw that out to get a look at what forward gross margins would be and I   got 33.2%. That is roughly a 5-6X improvement over the previous   quarters - Q3 had a gross profit of 6.3% and 5.7% in Q2.  This is where   the real growth comes in for me - they not only are going to double   their revenue from the previous year in the first half of this year, it   is going to be at much better margins.  Now that would still have them   trading at a fairly generous amount to their forward EBITDA - roughly   about 20X but growing revenue by at least 2.5X YoY and then improving   gross margins by 5-6X makes me think they are still very undervalued -   especially with the incoming catalysts of a NASDAQ uplisting and their   electric buses hitting the market/the market realizing they make green   vehicles.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n* Currently,   it looks like the $50 million in revenue is from a single customer -  at  least that is how I interpret it although that could be incorrect,  so  they will need to work on building relationships with other entities  as  this order and revenue from it dries up.\n* They   are trying to break into the American market, and while I see good   signs that they will, their small size and newness to the market may   scare some clients and also means that if they mess up anything they   could really be hurting\n* Speaking   of messing things up, their electric bus still has not passed testing   as that will happen in June.  I believe that it will pass with flying   colors based off of the results of their previous buses, but if it   doesn't for some reason they will be in a world of hurt.\n* Delays   in completing their American facility in Washington could cause them  to  lose orders or have orders delayed which would cause their stock  price  to drop.\n\nPositions:\n\nCurrently sitting at 1886 shares at an average price of $7.73 USD\n\n[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/XsViZOM)",

Investment decisions should not be made solely on the basis of this research.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nPAVmed (PAVM) is a medical device company. They have a 74% stake in Lucid Diagnostics who own a spread of devices (EsoGuard, EsoCheck, EsoCure) to detect and treat esophageal precancer. PAVM also has a minimally invasive device to treat carpal tunnel syndrome as well as infusion therapy devices, but these will not be taken into consideration in this report. \n\nThe esophageal portfolio has already been approved and launched. Sales will be the catalyst as it starts to generate revenues and receive CMS reimbursement. PAVM announced that they will spin off Lucid into a SPAC while keeping control over it, which should be a further catalyst. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Esophageal Cancer (EAC)**\n\nEsophageal cancer has increased significantly over the past few decades (&gt;550%). A diagnosis of EAC is essentially a death sentence, with mortality rates at over 80% 5 years post-diagnosis. A progression of EAC is fairly straightforward. It starts with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), causing stomach fluid to enter the lower esophagus, which causes swelling and eventually develops into a precancerous state. If no intervention is performed then the area becomes cancerous. \n\nHealth guidelines suggest that high-risk populations should get screening done every 3-5 years. The high-risk population includes every man 50 years old with chronic heartburn as well as an additional risk factor (being white is one of them). The total high-risk population is 13M alone just taking into consideration men in the US. \n\nCurrently, the best way to get screened is with an upper endoscopy, which is similar to a colonoscopy. This means that an additional person must accompany you and both people would have to take the day off work. Currently, less than 10% of the high-risk population undergoes screening (compared to over 60% of high-risk colon cancer screening). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EsoCheck (&amp; co.)**\n\nEsoCheck is a device the size of a pill (with a thin tube attached) that a patient swallows. When the capsule reaches the stomach the operator inflates the capsule which collects cells from the lower esophagus. The capsule is then deflated and the cell is retrieved. The entire procedure takes less than 5 minutes and can be performed by a nurse in an office setting.\n\nAfter watching these two videos you can get a sense of how quick and easy it is. \n\nAnimation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB61-PCExNM&amp;ab\\_channel=PAVmed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB61-PCExNM&amp;ab_channel=PAVmed) \n\nReal-life process: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwLwiZfln0&amp;ab\\_channel=PAVmed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwLwiZfln0&amp;ab_channel=PAVmed) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Market Strategy**\n\nThe company has several targeted approaches, but their most interesting one is their direct-to-consumer (DTC) approach that will be launched shortly. The concept is to select metro areas and release tv and radio ads. These ads will illustrate that heartburn could lead to cancer if not screened, which is a simple and powerful message. \n\nAdvertisement 1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FCbJqnC5xI&amp;ab\\_channel=LucidDiagnostics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FCbJqnC5xI&amp;ab_channel=LucidDiagnostics) \n\nAdvertisement 2: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PswcQ4jyq7g&amp;ab\\_channel=LucidDiagnostics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PswcQ4jyq7g&amp;ab_channel=LucidDiagnostics) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation**\n\n**Assumptions**\n\n13m high-risk patients (US males) would need screening once every 5 years\n\nEsoCheck CMS Payment: $1938 (zero cost to patient)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis leads to a US TAM of $25 bn every 5 years, or $5 bn every year. \n\nA 5% market penetration would lead to annual revenues of $250 m. A 20% market penetration would lead to annual revenues of $1 bn. \n\nApplying a 3x peak revenue multiple would lead to a $3 bn market cap potential, but given PAVmed will retain an estimated 50% ownership (due to planned spinoff), this leads to a market cap of $1.5 bn over the next few years. \n\n**$1.5 bn** market cap vs. current market cap of **\\~$480 m!** (an **increase of &gt;3x**)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Importantly, this valuation** **doesn\u2019t take into consideration the rest of PAVmed\u2019s portfolio**, such as their minimally invasive device that treats Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (Carpx) which will be launched later this year. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome affects around 2 m people annually. Of which, 600,000 people opting to undergo traditional surgery every year which requires months of rehabilitation\\* before returning to work while surgery done with Carpx allows patients to return to work within a single week. \n\n\\*0-30 days for desk-based work, 1-56 days for repetitive light manual labor, and 1-90 days for heavy manual labor\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interesting Note**\n\nStanley Lapidus (founder and former CEO of Exact Sciences, EXAS), who recently joined as a strategic advisor to the subsidiary (Lucid Diagnostics), made it clear in a call on February 22 that PAVM reminds him of EXAS in 2012 **before the value inflection**.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: Not financial advice, I eat crayons.\n\nOnce I saw the Canoo trucks on their promotional video I thought there is promise for the modularity of them being good candidates for the new USPS truck. But the USPS truck contract was given to Oshkosh Corporation, right? Well maybe. Turns out someone bought 55 million shares before the contract went public. Speculation: If the SEC finds misconduct will the deal be null and void? The vehicles are not due till 2023. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshkosh_Corporation\n\n(I have no idea how government contacts are dealt with)\n\nIf the bid is undone I think there are a couple good reasons they are a valid candidate.\n\nE.V. low speed efficiencies\n\nElectric Vehicles have insane gains on energy consumption at low speed.\n\nPower Consumption Curve for Tesla Model S\n(post). Now I found an article1 that concluded that switching Austin's USPS trucks to diesel trucks would cut down emissions. They used a speed of 15 mhp to run their simulations, note motor vehicles do not get the same energy gains at low speeds as e.v.[1]. I am not gonna even try to factor in the speeding up and down or the real characteristic of the battery pack (there will be energy loss but its Tesla's job to make these batteries as efficient as they can be). The NEDC\n\nestimates that full charge of 85 kWh can be discharged in 315 miles. User Frank99 found he can ride at around 244 Wh/mi for 40 miles at 70 mph. This took Frank 4/7 h or 0.57 hours.\n\nWith a size of 75k Wh for a total battery comes out to 75k Wh / 244 Wh / mi = 307.38 miles. Pretty close to the NEDC estimation.\n\n307 mi * (0.57 hours / 40 miles) = 4.385h of driving for an entire charge.\n\nTotal Watt hour consumed: 244 Wh/mi * 40 mi = 9.760 kWh\n\nReferring to the first graph the car would be around 300 kW 'consumption' for the majority of the time. The energy spent to hold at that level was 9.760 kWh for 0.57 hours of driving at 70 mph. Now suppose you only need to run to say 15 miles an hour well now you would just need to hold it at 125 kW. Now here's where real research people would know how much of a reduction in total power consumption this would be. I will guess the reduction (9.760 / 1.5 -&gt; 6.467 kWh) this would 1.5x the range of the Tesla Model S to over 450 miles before a recharge, but you can kinda just plug in value here and then multiple it with 307 to get your new range. I think anything between 1 and 2 is a good estimate because the reduction in the overall energy cost is a little over 2.\n\nNow I could not find information on this but I think a USPS truck travel less than 450 miles a day.\n\nCanoo is probably following Tesla and just letting/following the EPA give their estimated ranges or not even publishing them because so much of the battery life is dependent on the driver's habits.\n\nFor viewing pleasure: https://www. yt .com/watch?v=rbnvZlPZZQc (spam filter)\n\nModularity\n\nA general problem for the U.S. has is finding parts for stuff that is old. The previous USPS fleet truck was designed as Life Long Vehicle and their repair cost went through the roof as time goes on. The USPS even acknowledged this back in 2010 (pdf). Per Canoo's promotional video they are focusing on reliability and resell ability.\n\nReplacing other LLV\n\nThe deal with Oshkosh Corporation was for 50,000 to 165,000 to be produced. In 2010 there were 189,000 LLVs. There could be a cap for 165k LLVs now. Oshkosh could be capped at 50k if the USPS decides to revisit this after the investigation, as I do not think the plan of leaving 90% un-electrified fits with the current party.\n\n[1] Tractor and stuff run at pretty low rpm on diesel so there is a chance to get close to e.v. levels of gains with new science but I haven't done the research, but pulling from article1 the power consumption is 10x greater with their Diesel van than their electric van listed and they just use money. Coal factories as bad as they are way more efficient than car's when it comes to making energy.\n\nLooks like the short squeeze is back on if you trust ortex data see /u/brotherluminous\nfor more information.",

        "selftext": "Following up on Howard Marks January letter \"Something of value\" which you can find [here](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/something-of-value.pdf), in this interview with Joel Greenblatt they talk on how value investing has evolved over time and how value still remains value, even if we see it slightly different than the some decades ago. Here is the [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wle4M8Ai730) to the interview. While the talk is called something with interest rates, it is way more than that. \n\nFrom Marks letter I love the precise definition of value old school value investing  \"Value investing is one of the key disciplines in the world of investing. It consists of quantifying what something is worth intrinsically, based primarily on its fundamental, cash flow generating capabilities, and buying it if its price represents a meaningful discount from that value. Cash flows are estimated as far into the future as possible and discounted back to their present value using a discount rate made up of the prevailing risk-free rate (usually the yield on U.S. Treasuries) plus a premium to compensate for their uncertain nature. There are a lot of common valuation metrics, like the ratio of price to sales, or to earnings, but they're largely subsumed by the discounted cash flow, or DCF, method.\" \n\nAnd from the talk between the two I love how Joel Greenblatt is talking about what he understands as what stands behind value and that this approach has not change and will not ever change. He also underlines that he is open minded and does take other aspects into account like inflation and interest rates. In my opinion, the man has a brilliant mind.\n\nThought I\\`d share and would also love to hear your opinions on this,",

        "selftext": "\n\nLet's delve into some more evidence of market manipulation as well as an explanation of why we see \"intense\" price action at market open and close!\n\nIt\u2019s that time of the month! [NYSE Order Type data](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info#equities-order-types) has finally come through for March-21, we'll delve into it to see what's changed in the month of March-21. Are Shitadel up to their usual shenanigans again? We'll investigate this and more.\n\nThere are two things I want to go through before we get into the new order type data:\n\n1. NYSE Auctions (This will explain why we see so much action at market open and close)\n2. A recap on my previous post, for the new apes (for those who've read it, please skip ahead to \"March 2021 Order Type Data\")\n\nWith all that being said, let\u2019s dig in!\n\n# \ud83d\ude80 Market Close and Open Auctions\n\n**You can probably see what\u2019s coming from a mile away based on the section's name\u2026. But yes, this is the primary reason we see such huge volume at markets open and close!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NYSE Exchange Floor](https://preview.redd.it/sh2b3oa045s61.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acf2e934791a18172bbd5cf531ce33488d26f56a)\n\nLet\u2019s start with some history first, the NYSE is the oldest and also the largest exchange in the US. The photo above is what people generally think of when they think of the stock market, along with a group of unruly traders shouting shit at each other with funky hand gestures.\n\nWe\u2019ll touch on these human traders again, as some might be wondering, why the fuck do they still exist if everything is electronic.\n\n# \ud83d\udd59 And\u2026 The Open Auction Begins!\n\nAs we all know, NYSE opens up at 9:30 am EST for us retail apes. From 7:30 am onwards for the non-retail trader's orders can be placed to sell and buy. There are two key orders that are accepted before the market opens:\n\n1. [Market on open (MOO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketonopen-order-moo.asp)\n   1. This order seeks to purchase shares at the current market price at the time the market opens (yep, similar to the market orders we have access to, except it\u2019s delayed until market open)\n2. [Limit on open (LOO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitonopenorder.asp)\n   1. This order seeks to purchase a specific number of shares at a specific price when the market opens. If the trade is not met, it does not take place.\n\nBefore the market opens between 7:30 am there\u2019s a data stream that comes in that allows traders to observe imbalances between buy and sell order and their prices. The interval that the data is published increases in frequency as follows for traders to adjust their orders based on:\n\n1. 7:30 am - 9:00 am, data published every 5 minutes\n2. 9:00 am - 9:20 am, data published every minute\n3. 9:20 am - 9:30 am (market open), data published every 15 seconds\n\nOnce the time hits [9:28 am](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse/NYSE_Opening_and_Closing_Auctions_Fact_Sheet.pdf), BOOM, the likely opening price for each and every security on the NYSE is added to the published data streams and orders placed between 9:28 am and 9:35 am cannot be cancelled.\n\n**Human Time**\n\nSo where do our lovely human traders on the floor come into play? When extreme events happen.\n\nTake for example some groundbreaking news that happens after market close, if this has had devastating losses and a securities price sharply declines, under these circumstances a decision will be made by NYSE officials to disregard the securities previous closing price and to use a lower price as a reference point instead to start trading the next day.\n\n**DMM (Designated Market Makers)**\n\nNo DD can be complete without discussing Shitadel at least once right? They are of course a [DMM ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/designated-market-maker-dmm.asp)for the NYSE. So DMMs have a special as fuck role. They begin to open trading for each security under their control (**note I could not find if GME is assigned to Shitadel, reach out via PM if you have any info**).\n\nFun fact, DMMs have the authority to make price adjustments to facilitate trading by maintaining liquidity, interpret that as you wish\u2026\n\nSo that\u2019s market open auctions. It explains why we see so much action at the beginning of the market open as orders are processed based on order information flowing through from 7:30 am. A lot of the orders we\u2019d see executed would be the MOO and LOO orders defined above.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pddgj7ac45s61.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2754470752a5e9748d75037f8c3e19939797a6e\n\nBoth of these orders represent around 0.50% of orders across the NYSE, which seems small - but these orders are concentrated in such a small period of the trading day, it creates the action we observe each morning (sadly midnight for me).\n\n# \ud83d\ude34 And\u2026 It\u2019s time to Wrap Up, Market Close\n\nFor the most part, market close functions very similarly to market open. Let\u2019s go through the time differences and the different order types.\n\nTrade imbalance data begins at:\n\n1. 3:45pm - 3:59:55pm, every 1 second\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. During this period, data about trading volume, matching trades, trade imbalances and pricing is released. All of this sweet sweet data gives traders an idea into the direction of price movement and interest. Order time.\n\n1. [Market on close (MOC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketonclose.asp)\n   1. This order seeks to purchase shares at the current market price at the time of market close\n2. [Limit on close (LOC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitoncloseorder.asp)\n   1. This order seeks to purchase a specific number of shares at a specific price at market close. If the trade is not met, it does not take place.\n\nAn important differentiation between market open and close is that regular orders, including our market and limit orders as retail traders of course factor into the closing price.  Based on the chart above, **Market on Close** is the largest auction order, which you may link to the max pain theory that floats around. *Speculate away on that point.*\n\n# \ud83d\ude80 Summary on Auctions\n\nThe process of setting opening and closing prices is fucking complex that involves not just computers but human traders on the floor as well. It\u2019s also why we see increased volume at the open and close of the market! The more you know hey?\n\n# \ud83d\udcc8 Bonus Auction Content\n\nFeel free to stick around for this, or not \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f - I find it interesting to understand the context of why. So the bonus content is for those who wanna know why this is important that we have an auction at open and close.\n\nWe actually have highly fragmented markets, the NYSE alone is composed of multiple exchanges. This is why auctions take place for high cap equities on the NYSE Arca (Small-cap on the NYSE American) as traders get the benefit of liquidity being centralised in one exchange. E.g. no cross-exchange nonsense to worry about or consider. This essentially gives investors **transparency** and the **assurance** they will get a fair and accessible price.\n\nA particular example of this is the [**\u201cQuad Witching Day\u201d**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quadruplewitching.asp). Funnily enough, when pixel came up with the quad witching day, it was actually a term that already existed and is what traders are well aware of. r/GME\u2019s quad witching day however is nothing alike to the **real Quad Witching Day.**\n\nThe closing auction gets particular attention on the Quad Witching Day (when stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures expire) on June 16, and the Russel Rebalance (we all know what a rebalance is at this point, but it\u2019s when they rebalance their indices, like the ETFs we discuss) on June 23. On these particular days, volatility has the potential to go through the fucking roof - so it\u2019s important for liquidity to be centralised in a single process essentially which aggregates all the buy and sell interest.\n\nOverall, auctions are the least debated topic about exchanges as many view them as a trusted process.\n\n# \ud83c\udf54 ORDER TYPE TIME\n\nAs mentioned above, this is a copy-paste from my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mf1f6n/i_was_missing_a_key_piece_of_the_puzzel_this_is/). If you\u2019ve read it please skip ahead, if not stick around to get an understanding of the key order types HFTs (High-frequency Traders) and HFs can use when manipulating the market.\n\nLet\u2019s recap what we saw in terms of order behaviour on the NYSE Chicago exchange over the past 6 months.\n\n*(For those who have not read the post, the assumption here is that Shitadel use this exchange as their stomping ground, volume is also really low, so it\u2019s far easier to pick up on patterns compared to other larger NYSE exchanges)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NYSE Chicago Order Type Data](https://preview.redd.it/b36ncmly45s61.png?width=562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f6d5f54adae4062a3f8db0972724fbbef8f22a7)\n\nWe saw volume shift away from Limit Non-Routable IOC to:\n\n1. IOC ISO\n2. Limit Non-displayed\n3. Add Liquidity Only (ALO)\n\nThese three order types are the keys to the puzzle we\u2019ve been needing, to figure out their strategy to manipulate GME prices. So let\u2019s start off by getting an understanding of what they are!\n\nBare with the explanations, pretty graphs, charts and some pretty mind-boggling conclusions lay beyond the order type explanations.\n\n# IOC ISO (Immediate or Cancel Intermarket Sweep Order)\n\nFor those who have not read my previous post find an excerpt below.\n\n[Intermarket sweep order](https://ibkr.info/article/1734)\u2019s are generally a large quantity order that is sent to multiple exchanges.This is how it functions:\n\n* An order is submitted in the pre market to sell at a price of 40.80 and is sent to exchange A.\n* The best offer price on exchange A is 40.63.\n* Exchange B receives an intermarket sweep order to buy 800 shares of the stock at a limit price of 40.88.\n* The best offer price on exchange B is 40.88\n\nThe trader that enters the intermarket sweep order would be required to fulfill their Regulation NMS requirement by executing the maximum available quantity on exchange A at 40.63 and then may execute the balance of the order on exchange B at 40.88 even though it is at a price that is inferior to the 40.80 order resting in the book on exchange A. The 40.80 price is not the inside quote and is therefore not \"protected\" in terms of the balance of the sweep order executing at exchange B at a price of 40.88.\n\nSo in monke speak, it fills the lowest alternate exchange price before filling the order at the higher price.\n\nTo make it more complicated this is an order with a modifier (ISO is the modifier), so let\u2019s understand an IOC.\n\nThese are orders which attempt to execute immediately and cancel any unfilled portion. E.g. place a buy for 10 @ $180.01 , it\u2019s only able to be filled to a portion of 5 @ $180.01 and then canceled straight away.\n\nA key part to these types of orders is derived from the following.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*\"The intermarket sweep exception enables trading centers that receive sweep orders to execute those orders immediately, without waiting for better priced quotations in other markets to be updated.\"*\n\nThis is [derived from a response](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nyse-2014-32/nyse201432-2.pdf) to change how ALOs work by the NYSE, as they\u2019ve been a thorn in their side since 2014. A prelude to what we\u2019ll go into later. Sounds suspicious right?\n\n*\\*nudge nudge\\* Almost like they\u2019d be handy for HFTs \\*nudge nudge\\**\n\n# Limit Non-displayed\n\nAn order to buy or sell stock at or better than a specified price, these orders are HIDDEN from us apes and others. They also don\u2019t care about [lock or cross situation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lockedmarket.asp) cases. Refer to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdnph0/more_proof_the_115_billion_buy_order_was_real_and/) for an understanding of this.\n\nThis means the HFT (high-frequency traders) can effectively jump the line by posting [\u201chide not slide\u201d](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QmoFpdq9HeGJ-cdPP7y808uWxVufJNr2b69J0GY_-SQ/edit?usp=sharing) orders instead of visible orders. This is because a hidden order will not be slidden, resetting the timestamp. So if I placed an order at $120.01 for GME, they then place a hidden order for $120.01 as well, I get my timestamp to reset as I\u2019ve placed a locked/cross order, but the hidden order does not get their timestamp reset therefore essentially skipping the fucking line.\n\nYet another bread and butter tool when it comes to HFT. The key here though is the fact that it\u2019s HIDDEN and how this plays out with ALO order types (IB allows retail to place these orders as well).\n\n# \ud83d\udc0d Add Liquidity Only (ALO)\n\nFirst of all, major thanks to [u/SmithEchoes](https://www.reddit.com/u/SmithEchoes/) on this bad boy as it\u2019s a complicated beast.\n\nNow this order type is a doozy and is currently being used for nefarious purposes.\n\nALO follows a strict \u201cIf,then\u201d rule set based on if it locks [(7.31(e)(2)(b)iii-iv)](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37) OR crosses [(7.31(e)(2)(b)ii)](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37). This ruleset forces the ALO to perform these trades until it is fully consumed, or the order is cancelled. Rule [7.31(e)(2)(C)](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37), once ALO is resting on the exchange AND it was forced to change its price in accordance with [7.31(e)(2)(b)i-iv](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37) THEN it now gets to be priced in accordance with [7.31(e)(1)(A)iii and iv](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37). This is the equivalent of HFT when ALO \u201cactivates\u201d BUT it comes with a built-in safety feature that IF the price goes UP(Sell ALO) or DOWN (buy ALO) the ALO limit price is no longer locking or crossing at the values it was getting moved to, it REVERTS back to its original limit order price.\n\nMonke speak translator: These orders create sell/buy walls that have a nifty function that essentially \u201cflips the safety switch\u201d back to the original limit order price if too much buy/sell pressure is applied.\n\nFunnily enough, the NYSE has tried to [amend how ALO orders work](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/10/16/2014-24547/self-regulatory-organizations-new-york-stock-exchange-llc-nyse-mkt-inc-order-approving-proposed-rule), because of how they can be used for nefarious purposes\u2026. \\*cough\\* Shitadel \\*cough\\* The amendment would force to cancel the ALO once it crosses or locked, and not perform how it currently does in accordance with [7.31(e)(2)(b)i-v](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37). Which means no buy/sell wall capability for them to use and abuse.\n\n# \ud83c\udf54 March 2021 Order Type Data\n\nSTOP SCROLLING HERE, for the apes who skipped the order type run down.\n\nJust a reminder that ALO orders can essentially be used as a buy/sell order wall to stall and reverse a price by HFs and HFTs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[March-21 NYSE Chicago Order Type Data](https://preview.redd.it/hwkpq91655s61.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba2abf0158c3fd3fbe537d586357fcf7a91e53bd)\n\nWhat we\u2019re interested in above is the pretty amazing linear increase in the use of ALO orders within the NYSE Chicago exchange. So the logic behind this and the explanation above is that HFTs can abuse this order type, which is why the NYSE was trying to amend the order to no avail as it keeps getting shot down.\n\nWhen I wrote my last post it was late March, the only thing I was thinking was that an increase in evidence would be that ALOs continued to increase into March-2021 (only had Feb data available at previous time of writing). This is because we saw a HUGE consolidation period in February, and I was unsure if ALOs were heavily used in the drop from our mini squeeze in late January OR/AND the spike we saw in late February.\n\nCandle chart for reference below to put that into context.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qpuqamy855s61.png?width=695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a0349e841d96e4dbfde9d6f2a398b17c83c57f5\n\nDuring March we saw a lot of action in terms of buy/sell pressure reversing at many points - so to add more evidence of market manipulation I was expecting an increase in usage of ALOs to manage these reversals.\n\nAnd yes, we certainly did see an increase from 15.18% of all orders up to 16.04%, making the trend shown below a rather delectable insight into their use or ALOs for market manipulation. What\u2019s just as interesting is the non-growth of overall ALO orders, with NYSE Chicago being the one exchange that severely breaks this trend, adding more evidence of market manipulation, through abusing ALO order types.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart of ALO Order &amp;#37; of Total Exchange Order Types](https://preview.redd.it/3uiq0b8a55s61.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9336711e2c1462ea40f73e94da3cf383ec1ee6c)\n\nThanks for reading, as usual, conjecture is our friend, so share your thoughts and opinions! The ability we apes have to learn is one of our strongest tools to use against HFs, along with the most obvious strategy of HODL.\n\nNot finance advice.\n\n**Important: Let\u2019s Spread Awareness**\n\nMy dear Apes check this out.\nLet\u2019s spread awareness of what an massive fraud is happening currently on the stock markets. What better way is there than than educating ourselves and others?\n\n**Not financial advice**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I\u2019m just an idiat who has no clue what he\u2019a taklking about.

        "selftext": "This post will detail some speculation on why believe Bitcoin will soon break 60k and potentially move to 70k within the next month or two. I'm fairly confident the bull run for Bitcoin is not over yet and will continue into this year before we see a correction.\n\n\\-Current Price of BTC around time of this post is around 58k-\n\n**External Catalysts**\n\nThe past few weeks there have been an onslaught of positive news for BTC . To name a few major ones:\n\n\\- Paypal is now incorporating use and everyday people can exchange BTC and other cryptocurrency.\n\n\\- Square, Tesla, and several other companies have included it in their balance sheet. Microstrategy essentially embraced their whole mission around it. Overstock accepts BTC as payment.\n\n\\- Spending will be high with the stimulus package and other bills under Democrats. BTC can be seen as a hedge to the dollar\n\n\\- Visa and other credit cards have also started incorporating it.\n\n*More importantly, there are major catalysts that will be coming this April that will likely propel it forward more:*\n\n\\- BTC ETFs are already being submitted by major institutions like Fidelity. When the GOLD ETF was introduced, the value of gold went on bull run the year to follow.\n\n\\- Coinbase IPO will be happening in April if there are no more delays. This one is **major**! Just the event will get the talk of cryptocurrency spread and be the chatter of the month.\n\n\\- Literally today Chipotle is getting in on the fun too with their Burrito or Bitcoin event: [https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2021-03-30-Burritos-Or-Bitcoin-Chipotle-To-Give-Away-200k-In-Free-Burritos-And-Bitcoin-To-Celebrate-National-Burrito-Day](https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2021-03-30-Burritos-Or-Bitcoin-Chipotle-To-Give-Away-200k-In-Free-Burritos-And-Bitcoin-To-Celebrate-National-Burrito-Day)\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nBTC this week reached almost 60k three times this week.\n\nKey levels of Resistance: 60k, 64.5k\n\nKey levels of Support: 53k, 51k\n\nSettling at 58k is very bullish at it means it is bouncing *above* the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. If it's able to hold this it should be able to get to around 62k. If it passes the mental wall there, it can easily surge to 70k before correcting. If it fails to support 55k then we could see a downside\n\n**Tickers that follow Bit Coin: $MARA, $RIOT, $CAN**\n\nI chose three tickers to focus on that will likely benefit from a rally. I know there are other ones like SOS, BTBT, FTFT but those are high risk from what I've seen having short reports written up on them. And when Bitcoin goes down, they go down hard. Let me know if there are any new tickers that follow Bitcoin too.\n\n**MARA**\n\n\\- Bitcoin mining company I've been following since it was 5$. Has strong support\n\n\\- Recent News: To Launch the First North American-Based Bitcoin Mining Pool.\n\n\\- Reached a 52week high over 50+ today\n\n**RIOT**\n\n\\- Same as MARA a crypto mining company I've followed since it was 10$. It's always been slightly ahead of MARA but it seems the gap is closing.\n\n\\- Recently reported GREAT earnings 300% surprise in EPS\n\n\\- Heavily shorted (20%) which may be why it has not been climbing as hard in following BTC, but will easily soar multiple levels if Bit rallies hard enough.\n\n\\- Reached over 70 last time BTC ran\n\n**CAN**\n\n\\- The only Chinese stock I singled out that could see a strong run correlated with Bitcoin if it were to run this month.\n\n\\- Canaan manufactures equipment used for mining Bitcoin. As the price rises, more and more companies are enticed to mine.\n\n\\- Reached around 40 last time BTC ran\n\n*Bearish Warning:*\n\n\\- In the past when Bitcoin has ran, there has always been a big correction afterwards. Invest at your own risk.\n\n\\- Offerings can happen if the price climbs too much",

(the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cReconAfrica\u201d) (TSX-V: RECO) (OTCQX: RECAF) (Frankfurt: 0XD) are pleased to announce preliminary analysis of the data from the 6-2 well, the first of a three well drilling program, provides clear evidence of a working conventional petroleum system in the Kavango Basin.\n\nFirst Drill Site (6-2 well)\n\nThe well sample log of the 6-2 provides over 200 meters (over 660 feet) of oil and natural gas indicators/shows over three discrete intervals in a stacked sequence of reservoir and source rock. Extraction of oil from these samples and subsequent fingerprinting for key characteristics of the liquids, supports an active petroleum system with multiple source intervals.\n\nDan Jarvie, petroleum systems chemist and member of ReconAfrica\u2019s Advisory Board stated \u201cThese shows are indicative of migrated, thermogenic petroleum and occur over three different intervals in the 6-2 test well. The intervals penetrated include highly porous, permeable sediments and marine source rocks as predicted, and an extensive marine carbonate lithofacies. Mud gas results indicate a high BTU gas with the presence of light oil in numerous cutting samples. Based on these initial results, the components and processes for a working petroleum system are all present.\u201d\n\nWorking closely with MME and ReconAfrica to provide further detailed analysis of all data are premier industry service companies including:\n\n        Core Laboratories (\u201cCore Lab\u201d) of Houston, Texas in the analysis of         \n        potential reservoir rocks, and\n       \n        GeoMark Research, Houston, Texas on geochemical analysis of source\n        rocks and extracted liquids, including \u201cfingerprinting\u201d for key\n        characteristics, and\n       \n        Netherland Sewell &amp; Associates Inc, Dallas, Texas for petrophysical\n        analysis (rock properties and associated liquids) and additional geologic\n        analysis.\n\n\nSecond Drill Site (6-1 Well)\n\nWith drilling, coring and logging operations now complete on the 6-2 location, the Company owned rig is being mobilized to the 6-1 location, 16 kms (10 miles) north of 6-2 drill site. This second well is designed to evaluate the petroleum systems discovered in the first well (6-2) in an area of maximum thickness.\n\nHon. Thomas Alweendo, Namibian Minister of Mines and Energy stated, \u201cThis is a great period for the people of Namibia, with the results of the well confirming a big potential for a very valuable energy resource for our country and therefore a significant development for Namibia onshore exploration efforts. The positive results of this well have provided us with the critical information required to unlock the country\u2019s petroleum prospectivity and is the first step in the process of locating significant accumulations, we can now confidently confirm Namibia is endowed with an active onshore petroleum basin.\u201d\n\n\nTLDR : read the title, do your own DD",

        "selftext": "I asked myself this question, and the results surprised me. \n[Vanguard Research Paper](https://static.vgcontent.info/crp/intl/auw/docs/literature/research/role-home-bias-global-asset-allocation-decisions.pdf?20130819%7C151400#:~:text=Home%2Dcountry%20bias%20in%20global,large%20body%20of%20published%20research.&amp;text=Investors%20generally%20feel%20more%20comfortable,trade%2Doff%20for%20their%20portfolio.)\n\n[Ben Felix video on Home Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYedjI03Q0g)\n\n- **Arguments against Canadian Home Bias**\n\n**Canada's Market share of total world equity market value** is 2.4%\n\n**Domestic companies with an international scope are no substitute for international exposure** - Historical evidence suggests that a company\u2019s performance has been more highly correlated to its domestic market, regardless of where\nbusiness operations are conducted\n\n**overall diversification is broadened** - the Canadian market has around 348 tradable securities with XIC holding 231, with 38% in the top ten holdings. A traditional world-wide ETF, like VT, holds 8900 securities and has about 8% in its top 10 (VEQT has 12642 securities with 15% in its top ten). \n\n**Canada has very unbalanced sector allocations** - Canada's sector standard deviation is 8.01 (ex-Canada is 5.22) and is focused on Financials (31.2%), Energy (12.5%), Industrials (12.3%), and Materials (12.1%).\n\n**Greater Liquidity and Lower Costs** - the bid-ask spread for the US averages at 0.04%, while in Canada it is 0.35%. The ETFs incurs costs when rebalancing based on liquidity and transaction costs, with the US being the most liquid and cheapest market in the world. It is no secret that investing in the US, in US listed ETFs, is the cheapest route to a world-wide ETF. \n\n**Country-specific systematic risk from Canada is decreased**, of course the risk from the US (as that will comprise an even larger percentage of your portfolio) would be increased. Canada is tied with the US (at 5th) in terms of its ability to protect investors.\n\n**Currency risk has not been an issue historically** - as you'll see below, foreign currency exposure can lower volatility, and most studies have found that currency risks, when broadly diversified, investing in Canada, have mostly balanced out over time\n\n\n- **Arguments in Favor of Canadian Home Bias**\n\n**Familiarity and ease of access** - many investors believe in investing in \"what you know\", and historically, Canadian securities have been easier to access than foreign securities (though the ETF landscape has broken this barrier down to a large degree)\n\n**30% Canadian 70% ex-Canada portfolios had the lowest levels of volatility historically** - increasing or decreasing from 30% Canadian home bias in a world portfolio added greater volatility according to the historical returns\n\n**Increases sector diversification** - 100% ex-Canada portfolios have a sector standard deviation of 5.22 and are concentrated in Technology (20.2%), Financials (13.8%), Consumer Discretionary (13.3%), Healthcare (11.2%) and Industrials (11.2%). \n\nAdding a 30% Canadian tilt to that portfolio changes the standard deviation to 4.88 and brings consumer discretionary down (10.5%), Energy up (5.9%), Healthcare down (8.3%), Technology down (17.1%), Materials up (7.3%) and leave the rest relatively unchanged, except Financials become an outlier (19.0%).\n\n**Tax advantages** - a tilt to Canada means dividends have a minor tax advantage (in that less are hit by the US witholding tax); assuming we are looking at VEQT (a Canadian listed ETF), there is perhaps a 0.01% savings compared to an XAW. However, if you were buying the underlying funds, that may increase somewhat. \n\n**When Canada does well, you'll know, and it may cause regret** - if Sweden does very well, it is unlikely you'll know, so won't regret having a little less of the world markets; when Canada has a great year, and you are 3% invested, it may challenge your investing strategy and cause you to overtrade\n\n- Overall, it seems that Vanguard looked at the historical returns and bet on the lower volatility perhaps thinking it will support investors in staying invested. Truth be told, there is no way to know if 3%, 25%, 30% or some other amount of Canadian is the right mix, but certainly anything more than 50% is far, far too much, and anything less is down to personal preference - so why not bet on past, it has as good a chance of playing out the same way again as the others?",

        "selftext": "What is Ehang?\n\n**EHang** is a company that develops and manufactures autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) and passenger AAVs which have entered service in China for aerial cinematography, photography, emergency response, and survey missions.\n\n*1.* What does Ehang offer and is there market for these products?\n\na. Drones for passenger transportation: The market for passenger drones is huge, expected to reach **USD 33320 million** by the end of 2027 The areas of use are:\n\ni. Commercial air taxi\n\nii. Paramedic\n\niii. Sightseeing\n\niv. Private flight\n\nv. Firefighting\n\nvi. Police\n\nvii. Etc.\n\n**HOW DOES EHANG MAKE MONEY?**\n\nEhang has **several revenue** streams:\n\n1. Unmanned Air Passenger Transportation\n\n\"As serious congestion and pollution have become headache of traditional ground traffic system, EHang AAV is born to bring 3D air traffic system to reality. EHang aims at making safe, autonomous and eco-friendly air mobility accessible to everyone by providing comprehensive solutions including hardware and software configuration, takeoff and landing platform establishment and other operational services.\"\n\n2) Smart city management: providing customized drone solutions to enterprises.\n\n3) Aerial Media: \"With the night sky as a stage and landmarks being the backdrop, Multiple EHang AAVs demonstrate and transform their formation to display diversified messages and images in specific airspace, presenting a magnificent piece of work that is tailormade based on different branding or advertising requirements. \"\n\n**The main product: Ehang 216**\n\nThe 216 is a two-seater with 16 propellers in a coaxial double-baled design. It has made over 1,000 manned flights by July 2018 and its maximum range flown was 8.8\u00a0km (5.5 miles). It can fly 25 min for a range of 30\u201340\u00a0km (16\u201322\u00a0nmi). The aircraft is targeted for autonomous flying, to be monitored from an Ehang or its customer command-and-control center. Austrian aerostructures supplier FACC AG partnered with Ehang to certify and produce the aircraft in Europe, within simpler certification requirements for takeoff weights below 600\u00a0kg (1,320\u00a0lb).\n\nIn October 2018, the CAAC approved initial passenger operations at specific locations to develop urban air taxis regulations. Ehang began taking preorders since, for island-hopping and to a Chinese coastal resort for aerial sightseeing within their site. A 1\u00a0km (0.54\u00a0nmi) shuttle across the river of its home city of Guangzhou should avoid a 30 min drive due to traffic congestion on the downtown bridge.\n\nIn March 2020, the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority issued a permit for manned test and certification flights. It is the first such approval in Europe.\n\nOn May 27, 2020, EHang obtained the world's first commercial pilot operation approval from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (\u201cCAAC\u201d) to use EHang 216 passenger-grade AAVs for air logistics purpose. The EHang 216 received a special flight operations certificate (SFOC) from Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) for test flights in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.\n\n**General characteristics**\n\n* **Crew:** None (self-piloted)\n* **Capacity:** 2 passengers 260kg\n* **Length:** 5.61\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in)\n* **Height:** 1.76\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in)\n* **Propellers:** 16-bladed\n\n**Performance**\n\n* **Maximum speed:** 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph, 86\u00a0kn)\n* **Cruise speed:** 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph, 70\u00a0kn)\n* **Minimum control speed**\\*\\*:\\*\\* 70\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph, 38\u00a0kn)\n* **Range:** 16\u00a0km (9.9\u00a0mi, 8.6\u00a0nmi)\n\nFirefighting from the air\n\nThe EHang 216F is a version that can be used to fight fires from the air, especially in high-rise buildings. The maximum flight height is 600 m, it can carry up to 150 l of fire extinguishing. With a camera the fire is localized independently\n\n**FINANCES**\n\nEhang revenues have been consistently increasing yoy, with the company earning 70.98 million in q3 2020 (source: yahoo finance.) **THE EARNING REPORT FOR Q4 2020 WILL HAPPEN ON FRIDAY, APRIL 16th, BEFORE MARKET OPEN. THIS IS WHEN ANALYSTS EXPECT THE COMPANY TO TURN A PROFIT FOR THE FIRST TIME.**\n\n**SHORT REPORT**\n\n* The Wolfpack report is chock-full of inaccuracies, most of which have been addressed by management.\n* EHang is clearly the first mover in eVTOL with most competitors still several years away from commercialization.\n* Commercialization is coming this year and should drive a substantial acceleration in revenue growth.\n* Their unmanned drone business could be worth several hundred million dollars based on competitor valuations.\n\n**What we know has happened so far:**\n\na. Several drones have been sold\n\nb. Loads of test flights\n\nc. $40 million investment from Carmignac.\n\nd. $300 million stimulus from local governments\n\ne. Ehang has retailers in:\n\ni. Scandinavia\n\nii. Mexico\n\n*iii.* Europe\n\n*f.* Many more\n\n***What do we know is going to happen with Ehang nex****t?*\n\n*a.* Demonstration of how drones can be used to transport paramedics and medical equipment in the AIR-mour-project (2021-2023). [https://airmour.eu/](https://airmour.eu/)\n\n*b.* Demonstration of air taxi during the Olympics in Paris as a participant in the Reinvent air mobilty-project\n\n*c.* The new production facilities will start up production in q2 and there will be an investors day at the factory.\n\n*14.* What I belive and hope we will see of Ehang in the future:\n\n*a.* Ehang to demonstrate air taxi during the football world cup in Qatar. From [https://www.ooredoo.com/en/media/news\\_view/ooredoos-5g-enabled-aerial-taxi-lands-at-mobile-world-congress/](https://www.ooredoo.com/en/media/news_view/ooredoos-5g-enabled-aerial-taxi-lands-at-mobile-world-congress/) :\u201cThe self-driving 5G connected Aerial Taxi is not the only futuristic service on show that will leverage the superior speed and low latency of 5G. Ooredoo is also offering live demonstrations of how the technology can enable innovative services including child location monitoring, stadium security using drones, and intelligently connected apps to assist visitors at mega-events such as the upcoming football tournament in Qatar in 2022.\u201d\n\n*b.* Air taxi service start-ups around the world will order Ehang 216:\n\n*i.* Seaplane Hong Kong\n\n*ii.* South Korea\n\n*c.* Ehang will present a new long-range drone.\n\n*d.* Paramedic and medical services around the world are already trying to use drones and this will continue together with Ehang.\n\n*e.* Partnering up with a car company (the car company might handle the service and repair in the aftermarket) Volkswagen has already shown interest.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nI think the next thing we need to see is Ehang drones in use in projects organized by other organizations than Ehang, like in AirMour, Reinventairmobility (Paris Olympics) and air taxi in South Korea and Hong Kong. When Ehang is CHOSEN by others in real projects (both commercial and research) I believe we\u2019ll experience a wider acceptance of drones as a concept and Ehang as a producer. In some countries I think the use of drones in the paramedic service is going to force regulations to get in place because the socio-economic benefits in this sector are so tremendous and this will make way for other usage scenarios of drones. When people are getting used to the idea of passenger drones and the trust is growing, we\u2019ll see passenger drones in other kind of use, like air taxi and sightseeing. Rich people around the world are going to want to buy passenger drones for transportation from their penthouses to their offices. And suddenly we\u2019ll see Ehang drones everywhere fully integrated in our societies and life.\n\n**DISCLAIMER: Earning report will be in 2 days, friday before market open. I am not a financial advisor. i own a position in ehang.** This is my highest conviction play, ehang is the tesla of the skyes, and is **AHEAD** of all it's competitors, both in technologies and finances. It's a high risk high reward play, but safer than it's competitors, since ehang has **diversified revenue streams.** The stock was trading for as high as 120$; and the main reason is dropped was a shift away from growth stocks + the **short report, which has been mostly refuted. Wolfpack reserch has a history of shorting valuable reliable companies.**\n\n**CURRENT PRICE: 31$ average recommendation: buy. average price target: 52$ highest price target: 102$.**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 19th, 2021.\n\n# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.\n*****\n&gt; From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson &amp; Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.\n*****\n&gt; So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&amp;P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.\n*****\n&gt; That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.\n*****\n&gt; # Signs of margin pressures?\n&gt; Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.\n*****\n&gt; Utilities was the best performing major S&amp;P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week\u2019s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThose big forces that are threatening margins right now don\u2019t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,\u201d Calvasina added. \u201cMargins really are the big question mark going forward. I\u2019m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.\n*****\n&gt; While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.\n*****\n&gt; Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cCompanies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But not every company will see those benefits. \u201cWe could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs \u2014 increases in PPI and increases in CPI \u2014 those are negatives for margins,\u201d Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.\n*****\n&gt; # Searching for hints of inflation\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they\u2019re going to see price increases and others aren\u2019t because they can pass it on,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies\u2019 earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.\n*****\n&gt; The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.\n*****\n&gt; Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; # Economic rebound\n&gt; In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.\n*****\n&gt; There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday\u2019s report of 576,000 new claims \u2014 the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,\u201d note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week\u2019s report will be important.\n*****\n&gt; He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cUnfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won\u2019t be at least partially reversed next week,\u201d he wrote. \u201cContinuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Watching bonds\n&gt; Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,\u201d said Boockvar.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it\u2019s proven to be otherwise,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we\u2019ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/c7J5krZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lhy7AaR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/UW7ZbbU.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/uom4C2h.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/l0cX2LH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jpa2DZe.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PgmZlAV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3Rugxjf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gmHwRAL.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/po0gflq.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j0oHK6M.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jJcd0lq.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qX9lwYh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Jvf27dw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Four Reasons The Future Looks Bright For The Bulls\n\n&gt; \u201cI look to the future because that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life.\u201d George Burns\n\n&gt; The bull market continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we\u2019ll discuss more in this blog.\n\n&gt; Here are four bullish stats we\u2019ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.\n\n&gt; First, the S&amp;P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we\u2019d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&amp;P 500 was up &gt;10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Third, the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&amp;P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. \u201cIt might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we\u2019ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn\u2019t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn\u2019t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales\n\n&gt; After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.\n\n&gt; The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!\n\n&gt; Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Retail-Sales-14-months.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth a Market Cap Story\n\n&gt; Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IVW.png)**\n\n&gt; That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO.png)**\n\n&gt; In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW.png)**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**\n\n&gt; With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-Perf.png)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year \u201cWorst Months\u201d Mixed\n\n&gt; Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA\u2019s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the \u201cWorst Six Months,\u201d May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d November through April.\n\n&gt; In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the \u201cWorst Months\u201d have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ\u2019s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit \u201cWorst Months\u201d S&amp;P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough \u201cWorst Months\u201d in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/AIN_0521_20210415_Worst_Months_by_Election_Cycle_table.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 16th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyiCIE3-r7A))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.18.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$FCX** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$HOG** \n&gt; * **$DHI** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$NUE** \n&gt; * **$STLD** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$EDU** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$CCI** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$GNTY** \n&gt; * **$CCK**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/po0gflq.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/S1pKqwL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/SnFSpnl.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.19.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j8avW5c.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.19.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LL4z8Pi.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  4.20.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7FM5dh1.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.20.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qMSF98e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.21.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jzM0cgh.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.21.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoCal.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.22.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3jn4RTu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bivztrJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.23.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nh8sgYV.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.23.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Netflix, Inc. $546.54\n**Netflix, Inc.

        "selftext": "Rigel is a relatively small ($600m market cap) biopharmaceutical company with a lot of potential to make big waves in 2021. This year Rigel closed a co-development deal w/ Eli Lilly and received $125m upfront payment, secured $16.5m in funding from the Dept of Defense for their phase 3 Covid trial, released impressive investigator sponsored phase 2 Covid results just yesterday, and are on a path for potentially obtaining a EUA in that indication. Note last year they made $61m in net sales and $108m in total revenue. They are expecting steady growth in 2021 and have a platform for growth that has them well positioned in the industry. Below I'll be covering . . as much as I can.\n\n**Fostamatinib**\n\nFostamatinib has been approved by the FDA/EMA/ and Canada for the treatment of ITP; a disease by which the immune system destroys blood platelets. Roughly 78% of those who receive this as a second line therapy for cITP respond effectively to treatment and RIGL is producing additional data to help doctors determine if Fost is right for their patients as not only is it as effective as other treatments in this area (many of which have been used for a very long time and fost was approved in 2018) it is the only treatment that treats the disease, rather than the symptoms, and has far fewer adverse events which can be quite high in a disease that involve the management of platelets. \n\nFostamatinib is also in an orphan designated (shortened FDA review process) phase 3 wAIHA trial expecting enrollment completion in 2021. wAIHA is a disease by which the immune system destroys red blood cells and there are no approved therapies for this debilitating condition. In the ph2 study 48% of patients achieved the desired efficacy endpoint that ph3 is testing for. This indication is perfect for Rigel as the same doctors who treat ITP also treat wAIHA.\n\n**Fostamatinib in Covid**\n\nJust this week the National Institute of Health completed and released results of their phase 2 study of Rigel's Fostamatinib in severe Covid-19 patients (those requiring oxygen). It was a relatively small study (n=60) but the primary endpoint was just to determine that there wouldn't be an increase in adverse events, however adverse events were found to have actually decreased by 50% (3 vs 6) in the fost group. There were 0 deaths in the fost group, but 3 died who received standard of care. Only 4 patients were fully ventilated in this study and 2 were randomly assigned to each group; the 2 in the fost group recovered within 7 days; the 2 in the SoC group unfortunately passed. The fost group also spent 3 days on average in the ICU, whereas the SoC group spent an avg of 7 days. The NIH also collected substantial biometric data that they believe is pertinent in discerning the severity of disease state and while this data hasn't been specifically released it was noted to have all gone in favor of fost over the SoC. Rigel believes there may be a rational, based on this data, to begin pursuing a EUA in this indication and will be in discussions with both the FDA and DoD in the next few weeks. Note that while the companies phase 3 is currently enrolling, there's also a large study being conducted by the Imperial College of London on non-ICU covid patients.\n\n[https://www.rigel.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/312/positive-topline-data-shows-fostamatinib-meets-primary](https://www.rigel.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/312/positive-topline-data-shows-fostamatinib-meets-primary)\n\n[https://78449.themediaframe.com/dataconf/productusers/rigl/mediaframe/44572/indexl.html](https://78449.themediaframe.com/dataconf/productusers/rigl/mediaframe/44572/indexl.html)\n\nIt's important to note that fostamatinib was identified by prestigious institutions as a potential Covid therapeutic and reached out to Rigel with their findings. Below is a comprehensive list of this research.\n\nU of Amsterdam researchers demonstrate Fost completely blocks Cov cytokine storm.\n\n[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.190140v1.full.pdf](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.190140v1.full.pdf)\n\nSame researchers show it completely blocks Cov platelet aggregation and thrombosis.\n\n[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.437014v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.437014v1)\n\nThe National Institute of Health completed a study showing fost completely preventing Cov NETosis which is suspected of being key to a number of the severe thrombotic related complications. Essentially fostamatinib is preventing neutrophils from being lysed or destroyed which causes a process by which their extra-cellular DNA is released into the blood serum that then binds to available proteins while potentially even attracting platelets into the mix. This process, called NETosis, forms small nets that trap pathogens and is believed to be devastating when occurring at high levels throughout the body. Most patients who eventually die have been shown to have micro-thrombi that have made its way into the lung alveoli which may be due to this process. Everything from \"covid fingers/toes\", multiple organ failure, and even the covid fog/cns problems may be related to this process (DNA is small enough to potentially pass the blood brain barrier). Below I'll also include a nice video of an NIH discussing NETosis and their \"wow moment\"; definitely worth a watch.\n\n[https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/6/981/6046406](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/6/981/6046406)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcvJ2kEGOZ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcvJ2kEGOZ0)\n\nHarvard and MIT concluded it is the only drug in their 3700 drug database that prevents mucin-1 release in the lungs that's associated with Cov ARDS and non-Cov pneumonias, COPD and cystic fibrosis.\n\n[https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(20)30181-6](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(20)30181-6)\n\nThe Dept of Defense granted RIGL $16.5M to complete their phase 3 which is ongoing.\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rigel-awarded-16-5-million-from-us-department-of-defense-for-phase-3-clinical-trial-of-fostamatinib-in-covid-19-patients-301218290.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rigel-awarded-16-5-million-from-us-department-of-defense-for-phase-3-clinical-trial-of-fostamatinib-in-covid-19-patients-301218290.html)\n\nCovid Clinical Trials\n\n[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04579393?term=Fostamatinib&amp;draw=3](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04579393?term=Fostamatinib&amp;draw=3)\n\n[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04581954?term=fostamatinib&amp;cond=Covid19&amp;draw=1](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04581954?term=fostamatinib&amp;cond=Covid19&amp;draw=1)\n\n[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04629703?term=fostamatinib&amp;cond=Covid19&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04629703?term=fostamatinib&amp;cond=Covid19&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1)\n\n**Fostamatinib and future indications**\n\nThe preclinical studies listed above pointed to additional indications that fostamatinib may effectively treat; everything from cytokine release syndrome to non-Covid ARDS and acute lung injury indications. Rigel plans to pursue some of these indications in the future and the data collected from the cov trials may guide this process.\n\nFurther, there has been some revival of Fostamatinib as a potential treatment for RA as new investigator sponsored trials have found it to be safer and more efficacious than previous data implied. Originally Astrazeneca who has rights to the development of Fost (which were returned to RIGL) ended a ph3 study perhaps prematurely as it wasn't shown to be as effective as JAK inhibitors which since have been black boxed over safety concerns.\n\nAdditionally it is of note that a recent study of all FDA approved drugs and their interactions highlighted Fostamatinib specifically as the most important finding as it interacted with over 300 drug targets.\n\n[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247018)\n\n**RIP1K**\n\nRigel developed its RIP1/RIP1K program through phase 1 trials and just this year closed a deal with Eli Lilly where RIGL received $125M upfront, w/ $835M in potential milestone payments and future royalties for any approved products. This is a co-development agreement that will primarily target large indications that Eli Lilly has expertise in such as Alzheimer's disease or other CNS indications. RIGL has various points where they can opt out of further participation and the extent of their role in development will impact the amount of royalties they will be entitled to.\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lilly-and-rigel-enter-strategic-collaboration-to-develop-ripk1-inhibitors-for-the-potential-treatment-of-immunological-and-neurodegenerative-diseases-301230502.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lilly-and-rigel-enter-strategic-collaboration-to-develop-ripk1-inhibitors-for-the-potential-treatment-of-immunological-and-neurodegenerative-diseases-301230502.html)\n\n**IRAK1/4**\n\nRigel recently completed phase 1 trials of its one of a kind IRAK1/4 inhibitor that in a small human studies demonstrated profound reduction in cytokine release which may be valuable for a number of auto-immune and even oncology indications.\n\n**Outlicensed drugs**\n\nRigel has an extensive drug discovery program and has out-licensed a number of drugs that are currently in development. Rigel has received a number of substantial milestone payments already and will be eligible for royalties on any future drug sales. In 2020 alone they brought in 48m in various milestone payments.\n\n**Price Targets, institutional ownership and market cap**\n\nH.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis has a price target of $11.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Kristen Kluska price target of $7.\n\nBMO Capital analyst Do Kim has a price target of $9.\n\nRigel is currently valued at \\~$3.60 or about $600m.\n\nRigel has a high institutional ownership ranging between 80-90%.\n\n**Pipeline**\n\n[https://www.rigel.com/pipeline](https://www.rigel.com/pipeline)",
