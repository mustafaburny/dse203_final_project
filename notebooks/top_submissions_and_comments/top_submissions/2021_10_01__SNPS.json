Others were exiting with a quickness (understatement).  There was a day when the whole float was treated (44 million shares), but I decided to add.  Why? Let me explain.  \n\n \n\n**First, Why did it Crater?**\n\nShort sellers attacked SAVA with essentially a short report called a citizens petition (CP). Jordan Thomas's (JT's) thesis was, \"the FDA must stop phase 3 trials to protect patients.\"  Well, patient safety is undoubtedly a noble concern, except that JT offered NO evidence of any serious safety events (in over 70 pages).  Then why did JT pick safety?  Because the FDA only halts trials for safety issues.  Well, fast forward a month, and as expected, Phase three trials started two days ago (the FDA did not stop them).  Also, as expected, the SP is steadily recovering. Clear proof that the CP and all its allegations are a nonissue. This, fellow SAVAage apes, is essentially a buying opportunity in its purest unadulterated form. Rise!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Who Try To Stop More Wrinkle!](https://preview.redd.it/s6vmu66kutq71.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c4f3640274895d14003b58c17941bbb0e959b0)\n\n \n\nIf you want to take a deeper dive, please see my post on the CP and the motives behind it:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SAVA\\_stock/comments/pmy1uz/calling\\_all\\_savage\\_apes/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SAVA_stock/comments/pmy1uz/calling_all_savage_apes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nJoe Springer uses conservative estimates (based on the TAM and medication revenue) to arrive at an SP of $3750. (That's after FDA approval, potentially in 12-18 months). \n\nSo, where are we?  We have a stock that FUD has beaten down. It is on its way to recovery.  It also is a potential multi-bagger within 12 months or less.  \n\n \n\n**When to buy?**\n\nSAVA hit a low of $39, and over the last two weeks, it has recovered to $62 as of 9/30. For you smooth-brained apes and degenerates, thats a 58% increase in two weeks.  Too late to buy? No, SAVA's SP needs to appreciate over 100% to reach ATH's, which it hit before JT's FUD. More importantly, after my DD, I'm convinced SAVA's SP will be over $1000 within 12 months. Let me now discuss the certifiably psychotic SP I just mentioned ($1000).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Im more of an investor than a trader, but this chart though... Had to share.  There is a nice cup and handle formation if you zoom about to about 3 weeks time frame. ](https://preview.redd.it/5me3rxxi5tq71.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a26423fd61b8be21ae7052a697d893d9c1166129)\n\n \n\n**The Market:**\n\nHalf of all elderly hospitalizations are related to AD.  It is the 6th leading cause of death per the CDC.  However, some epidemiologists argue that this data underestimates the genuine harm, and AD is actually the 3rd leading cause of death behind cardiovascular disease and cancer. The treatment?  There is no adequate AD treatment. The market is gravely, desperately looking.  Let me give you another example.\n\nThe FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm (BIIB's AD drug mentioned above). Aduhelm causes brain swelling in 30% of the people who take it. The risk of brain swelling requires serial Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k annually. Most incredible is that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL, in two separate trials.  Several insurers, hospitals, and many physicians have refused to use Aduhelm. Again, for emphasis, the FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation over a trillion dollars. Caregivers? Their fate is more difficult than the patient's.   \n\nSo now you understand the market and how desperately the FDA needs to approve something for Patients, families, and caregivers. To reiterate, as a physician, I believe this is one of the most underserved areas in all of medicine. \n\n**What does SAVA have to offer:**\n\nAduhelm (BIIB's AD medication) is a flop, so I won't misuse my time differentiating Aduhelm from SAVA's AD med, Simufilam.  LLY's medication is slightly better than placebo, but when compared to SAVA's Simufilam, well, there is no parity.  Not only is Simufilam cheaper, easier to administer (oral vs. IV), safer, but SAVA's data in phase 2 is the best phase 2 data ever presented for AD!  Every Physician, PA, NP, nurse, and tech I have discussed the data with (in person, real people, who know and trust me) has become an investor.  Four of those individuals were neurologists. Yes, anecdotal, but all glory starts with anecdotes. Synopsys:  Simufilam's data thus far is historical.  As in AD, data has never been this promising.\n\nA couple of important technical points (also to give the illusion that I am impartial, and I admit Im not):  SAVA's data is open-lable and, thus, more likely to be influenced by placebo (This is an actual valid limitation of the open-label data). However, earlier randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial backs up the open-label data. It also correlates well with the biomarker data.  Further, as Remi (the CEO of SAVA) pointed out, the degree and duration of response make placebo highly unlikely. Additionally, the trial was multicenter, and independent 3rd parties administered the test. All the endpoints were clearly defined and met, making \"p-hacking\" less likely (a common way biopharma fluffs their data). What's all this jargon mean?  There is a high probability that Phase 3 should replicate Phase 2 data. If SAVA can indeed reproduce the data in a trial with a control arm, then historic data aside, we have a quick, easy FDA approval.  Also, we dont need historical data; SAVA only needs to show a slowing cognitive decline, not an improvement in cognition (as it has in phase 2).  Or, as apes say, Simufilam. cause. more. wrinkle.    Lastly, the FDA has given SAVA a \"Special Protocol Agreement\" (SPA) to simplify the approval further.  The SPA removes subjectivity and dumb downs (fewer wrinkles required) in the approval process. A simple if-then statement. If there is improvement in cognition (or even a slow down of decline), then FDA we have approval. \n\nLLY's AD medication effect is probably the most robust, at least until Simufilam presented its data.  Here is a chart comparing the expected decline (gray) vs. LLY's drug (green) vs. SAVA's Drug (Red).  Yes, the higher the line, the better the medication.  Yes, it is that much better. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bz2l8wc2xpq71.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6f295820005ef081f087a56ce51546ca78fa2b4\n\n \n\nI have linked a neurologist's blog. This said neurologist served on the FDA advisory committee and has decades of clinical experience. He has many more wrinkles than myself and speaks about why the data is phenomenal.\n\nhttps://luysii.wordpress.com/2021/08/25/cassava-sciences-9-month-data-is-probably-better-than-they-realize/  \n\nSo we have to ask ourselves if SAVA's medication is safe (which it is) and better (in terms of cost, efficacy, safety, administration, etc.), then should it also get fast-track approval?  Yes, I firmly believe that SAVA's AD medication, Simufilam, will get Breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) or fast-track approval via some other method.  Other methods include \"Priority Review,\" \"Accelerated Approval.\"  Or simply the FDA ends the trial early and approves the medication (for early proven efficacy, Yes, this happens, which we will talk about soon). Please recall what happened to LLY when BTD was announced. If you dont remember anything else from this read, please remember this point.  If SAVA discloses BTD or the like, its market cap should rocket skyward and beyond.  If history is our gauge, then we should see an 8.5x after the announcement, at minimum. \n\nAs this need is tremendous, I expect the FDA to act extraordinarily manner. Has the FDA ever halted to approve a medication or therapy because delay in approval is unethical?  The unethical part is holding a beneficial treatment from the placebo arm in a study and further from the general population (for the smooth-brained apes amongst us).  Yes, read on for the history lesson.\n\nThe FDA halted the SPRINT and ASCOT-BPLA trials early. This was done because the FDA noted a benefit in the treatment arm and concluded that it would be unethical to keep giving patients a placebo. These are just two of many examples. I firmly believe the same will happen to Simufilam.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5024796/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5024796/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Other Catalyst:**\n\nPartnership announcement with a cash infusion.  In his previous earnings call, Remi stated there would be a \"non-dilutive, nondebt\" cash infusion within \"weeks to months.\"  Im guessing this announcement will be at earnings 11/8. \n\nExpect SAVA to release 12-month biomarker data soon.  In its earlier 28-day trial, Simufilam had excellent biomarker data. So I believe the 12-month data will look fantastic as well.  \n\nThe COO announced a \"hypergrowth phase,\" which is currently underway.  SAVA has purchased a 90,000 sq foot building and partnered with Evonik (one of the world's largest drug manufacturers).  SAVA has also partnered with 50+ research sites across the country for phase 3 trials.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere has been institutional buy very recently, which is a great sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/24ltp5a0htq71.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8669415c0476d6c9c2c1998937b4a3f2cea33761\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4v7h0k4bhtq71.png?width=997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d92cd3cfc7130e550041260c00f09e2d4e5ffead\n\n \n\n# Ortex Update September 30th, -2.49% Short Interest, Utilization 99.43%, Cost to borrow rising fast 5.78%\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSo Cost to borrow rate is increasing and its going fast now, SAVA is a hard to borrow stock meaning the shorts will find it hard to get any shares to short with besides what they have already lent =)\n\nShort interest estimated is down 2.49%\n\nTotal estimated short interest is 33.46%\n\nTotal shares estimated short 12.53 million\n\nshares on loan 17.21 million\n\nfree float on loan 45.96%\n\nUtilization 99.43%\n\nCost to borrow 5.78% (it was 3.86 yesterday) CTB minimum 6.91%\n\non loan avg age (D) 23.99\n\nNumber of loans 903\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6hygycqhtq71.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=add4783fcc7043b9f12319636aaee7167d4ad036\n\n SAVA is heavily shorted as seen above.  I believe the bulk of the shorters are hoping the general market will crash, and stocks that ran the most will be crushed the hardest. SAVA is one of the best-performing stocks in the last two years and thus has a very high beta. In my estimation, thats a grave mistake.  Not only because shorts are betting on the loss of a much-needed medical treatment but also because the data is historical and consistent across several studies and endpoints.  The odds are stacked against shorts, Bigley.  With one announcement, SAVA could squeeze well past ATH's ($147) regardless of what the general market is doing.\n\nFunding isn't a near-term issue. $SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. SAVA is getting daily institutional buying has increased significantly since the 12-month data was made public.\n\nApologies if this makes you gag, but I must. I believe I have seen the worse of humanity after seeing JT, and his crew, try and FUD SAVA out of existence. I find it heinous morally reprehensible. This thought motivates me to hold through the rollercoaster ride that SAVA has been. Knowing I support a potential breakthrough therapy\u2014an unmet medical need is plaguing our loved ones.  Sleep well, effing shorts; your time is coming. \n\nThis is not medical or financial advice. Over 19 years, I've been wrong many times. If you can't tell from my post, Im excited.  Very excited about SAVA and might be overly optimistic, maybe even biased, so please do your own DD. Good luck! I'll continue posting SAVA updates if there is interest.\n\n**TLDR:**  SAVA cratered because of FUD. Simufilam is the culmination of decades of trial and error. There are tens of millions of patients waiting on this medication globally. It has massive potential (SP of over 3000) within 1-2 years.  It has already appreciated over 50%.  Get in while you can.",

Lastly, the FDA has given SAVA a \"Special Protocol Agreement\" (SPA) to simplify the approval further.  The SPA removes subjectivity and dumb downs (fewer wrinkles required) in the approval process. A simple if-then statement. If there is improvement in cognition (or even a slow down of decline), then FDA we have approval. \n\nLLY's AD medication effect is probably the most robust, at least until Simufilam presented its data.  Here is a chart comparing the expected decline (gray) vs. LLY's drug (green) vs. SAVA's Drug (Red).  Yes, the higher the line, the better the medication.  Yes, it is that much better. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bz2l8wc2xpq71.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6f295820005ef081f087a56ce51546ca78fa2b4\n\n \n\nI have linked a neurologist's blog. This said neurologist served on the FDA advisory committee and has decades of clinical experience. He has many more wrinkles than myself and speaks about why the data is phenomenal.\n\nhttps://luysii.wordpress.com/2021/08/25/cassava-sciences-9-month-data-is-probably-better-than-they-realize/  \n\nSo we have to ask ourselves if SAVA's medication is safe (which it is) and better (in terms of cost, efficacy, safety, administration, etc.), then should it also get fast-track approval?  Yes, I firmly believe that SAVA's AD medication, Simufilam, will get Breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) or fast-track approval via some other method.  Other methods include \"Priority Review,\" \"Accelerated Approval.\"  Or simply the FDA ends the trial early and approves the medication (for early proven efficacy, Yes, this happens, which we will talk about soon). Please recall what happened to LLY when BTD was announced. If you dont remember anything else from this read, please remember this point.  If SAVA discloses BTD or the like, its market cap should rocket skyward and beyond.  If history is our gauge, then we should see an 8.5x after the announcement, at minimum. \n\nAs this need is tremendous, I expect the FDA to act extraordinarily manner. Has the FDA ever halted to approve a medication or therapy because delay in approval is unethical?  The unethical part is holding a beneficial treatment from the placebo arm in a study and further from the general population (for the smooth-brained apes amongst us).  Yes, read on for the history lesson.\n\nThe FDA halted the SPRINT and ASCOT-BPLA trials early. This was done because the FDA noted a benefit in the treatment arm and concluded that it would be unethical to keep giving patients a placebo. These are just two of many examples. I firmly believe the same will happen to Simufilam.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5024796/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5024796/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **Other Catalyst:**\n\nPartnership announcement with a cash infusion.  In his previous earnings call, Remi stated there would be a \"non-dilutive, nondebt\" cash infusion within \"weeks to months.\"  Im guessing this announcement will be at earnings 11/8. \n\nExpect SAVA to release 12-month biomarker data soon.  In its earlier 28-day trial, Simufilam had excellent biomarker data. So I believe the 12-month data will look fantastic as well.  \n\nThe COO announced a \"hypergrowth phase,\" which is currently underway.  SAVA has purchased a 90,000 sq foot building and partnered with Evonik (one of the world's largest drug manufacturers).  SAVA has also partnered with 50+ research sites across the country for phase 3 trials.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere has been institutional buy very recently, which is a great sign.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/24ltp5a0htq71.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8669415c0476d6c9c2c1998937b4a3f2cea33761\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4v7h0k4bhtq71.png?width=997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d92cd3cfc7130e550041260c00f09e2d4e5ffead\n\n \n\n# Ortex Update September 30th, -2.49% Short Interest, Utilization 99.43%, Cost to borrow rising fast 5.78%\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSo Cost to borrow rate is increasing and its going fast now, SAVA is a hard to borrow stock meaning the shorts will find it hard to get any shares to short with besides what they have already lent =)\n\nShort interest estimated is down 2.49%\n\nTotal estimated short interest is 33.46%\n\nTotal shares estimated short 12.53 million\n\nshares on loan 17.21 million\n\nfree float on loan 45.96%\n\nUtilization 99.43%\n\nCost to borrow 5.78% (it was 3.86 yesterday) CTB minimum 6.91%\n\non loan avg age (D) 23.99\n\nNumber of loans 903\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6hygycqhtq71.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=add4783fcc7043b9f12319636aaee7167d4ad036\n\n SAVA is heavily shorted as seen above.  I believe the bulk of the shorters are hoping the general market will crash, and stocks that ran the most will be crushed the hardest. SAVA is one of the best-performing stocks in the last two years and thus has a very high beta. In my estimation, thats a grave mistake.  Not only because shorts are betting on the loss of a much-needed medical treatment but also because the data is historical and consistent across several studies and endpoints.  The odds are stacked against shorts, Bigley.  With one announcement, SAVA could squeeze well past ATH's ($147) regardless of what the general market is doing.\n\nFunding isn't a near-term issue. $SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. SAVA is getting daily institutional buying has increased significantly since the 12-month data was made public.\n\nApologies if this makes you gag, but I must. I believe I have seen the worse of humanity after seeing JT, and his crew, try and FUD SAVA out of existence. I find it heinous morally reprehensible. This thought motivates me to hold through the rollercoaster ride that SAVA has been. Knowing I support a potential breakthrough therapy\u2014an unmet medical need is plaguing our loved ones.  Sleep well, effing shorts; your time is coming. \n\nThis is not medical or financial advice. Over 19 years, I've been wrong many times. If you can't tell from my post, Im excited.  Very excited about SAVA and might be overly optimistic, maybe even biased, so please do your own DD. Good luck! I'll continue posting SAVA updates if there is interest.\n\n**TLDR:**  SAVA cratered because of FUD. Simufilam is the culmination of decades of trial and error. There are tens of millions of patients waiting on this medication globally. It has massive potential (SP of over 3000) within 1-2 years.  It has already appreciated over 50%.  Get in while you can.",
