        "selftext": "**Context -**\n\n\u00b7  S&amp;P 500 (+0.3%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%) hit fresh record highs. The two indices gained 0.7% and 2.7% for the week, respectively. The Dow (+0.7%) outperformed today, ending the week unchanged.\n\n\u00b7  While the Friday session ended on a firmly higher note, the bulk of the trading day saw the S&amp;P 500 oscillate near its flat line. The technology sector (+1.2%) continued showing relative strength thanks to a big gain in Apple (AAPL 497.48, +24.38, +5.2%), which supported the entire market.\n\n\u00b7  Most of the remaining ten sectors spent the bulk of the day in negative territory, but the continued outperformance in technology emboldened some late buying elsewhere. Only four sectors ended in the red with losses ranging from 0.3% (financials) to 0.6% (energy) while heavily-weighted groups like industrials (+0.3%) and consumer discretionary (+0.3%) recorded gains.\n\n\u00b7  Industrials received a boost from Deere (DE 199.50, +8.40, +4.4%) after the company reported better than expected results for Q3 and issued net income guidance for the fiscal year. Transport stocks had a good showing, but the Dow Jones Transportation Average (+0.4%) still shed 0.2% for the week.\n\n\u00b7  The consumer discretionary sector received some assistance from homebuilders after today's release of a stronger than expected Existing Home Sales report for July, which followed better than expected Housing Starts and Building Permits on Tuesday. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB 56.59, +1.20, +2.2%) climbed to a fresh record high.\n\n\u00b7  The energy sector was the day's worst performer, surrendering 6.3% for the week. Crude oil fell $0.31, or 0.7%, to $42.31/bbl, but gained $0.26, or 0.6%, for the week.\n\n\u00b7  Lawmaker\u2019s in Washington did not get any closer to reaching a fiscal stimulus deal while trade representatives from China and the U.S. will reportedly talk in the near future.\n\n\u00b7  Existing Home Sales for July, which soared 24.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million (consensus 5.39 million). That is the largest monthly increase on record, eclipsing the prior record seen in June. Total sales in July were up 8.7% from a year ago.\n\n\u00b7  The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects robust demand for existing homes. That is constraining supply even further, which will be a pressure point that feeds higher prices and bolsters the prospects for new home sales.\n\n**Index Summary -**\n\nS&amp;P 500 +0.36%;  Nasdaq +0.7%;\n\nDOW +0.51%; Russell 2000  -0.74% \n\nVIX:  22.54 -0.18,(  -0.79%)\n\n**Sector Summary -**\n\n*The three highest sectors for today were :*\n\n Information Technology +1.27%;  Consumer Discretionary +0.52%;  Industrials +0.41%;\n\n*The three lowest sectors for today were :*\n\n Energy  -0.63%;  Materials  -0.58%;  Communication Services  -0.44%;\n\n**Commodities -**\n\nGold -  1927.3,(  -0.99%);  Crude -  42.27,(  -0.73%) \n\n*Today\u2019s Option Activity Fast Facts -*\n\n **CBOE Put/Call Ratio -**  0.46\n\n ***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** KEYS with 11 x the ADV of 2439.

Do chip in your thoughts about it!\n\nAAPL - 5.57%\nMSFT - 10.44%\nAMZN - 9.52%\nFB - 9.17%\nGOOG - 6.91%\nNVDA - 10.3%\nADBE - 13.54%\nASML - 9.07%\nTSM - 7.48%\nV - 9.35%\nMA - 8.64%\n\nI think majority of the stock selections are pretty mainstream, picked to mimic QQQ. I personally added TSM and ASML as I\u2019m a strong believer in semiconductors going forward.\n\nWhat differentiates the portfolio above and QQQ is the weights itself. Instead of adjusting it based on market cap, I\u2019ve decided to optimise the weights above with a sole focus - to maximise Sortino Ratio.\n\nBacktested portfolio since Sept 2012 vs QQQ:\nCAGR - 36.71% vs 20.06%\nStDev - 16.97% vs 14.97%\nBest Year - 57.78% vs 38.96%\nWorst Year - 5.52% vs -3.63%\nSortino Ratio - 4.17 vs 2.28\n\nBy analysing the numbers above, it\u2019s basically a less diverse portfolio with 11 holdings, higher StdDev but significantly higher returns, and a much more efficient fund. Even the worst year for it is still a positive return. \n\nYes I\u2019m aware that my findings are based on historical prices and it doesn\u2019t guarantee future returns",

        "selftext": "Since everyone has been talking about investing in SQ, I thought maybe we could start an open discussion about the risks of Square the business, whether or not we can continue to expect a skyrocketing share price in the years to come.\n\nI'll point out some things I'm iffy about, would like to get feedback on what you all think. Maybe there's things I'm not aware of.\n\n* Competitors. Square has a good product in an explosive growth industry, but I see their products easily replicable by Apple, Google, and PayPal. Should their business prove to have high demand and margins, there's no doubt FAANG giants will follow. Square has a head start, but do they have a competitive advantage? They have lots of commercial business data atm, but I'm doubtful of the value of that in today's market (more on that in my next point). They're beginning to collect consumer data, but imagine how much more data Visa and Mastercard has over them on that. Their technology is easily replicable by other big companies with enough resources to execute.\n* The limitations of the loan business. One of Square's most promising competitive advantages is that they provide loans to small businesses that show promising growth and room for expansion based on their revenue and profit which is logged into the Square system. There is an undeniable market of unserved small business owners that greatly benefit from this feature, but it's doubtful that this would unleash profits that wouldn't hit a low ceiling most of the time. For example, a hair salon can only purchase so many new salon chairs before they run out of customers to serve within that vicinity. Square could strike gold with a really profitable revolutionary small business, but I don't see why those businesses wouldn't be funded by VC's first before coming to Square. Even if they came to Square first, those businesses are one in a million. I do see Square making profits here, but not profits that would take them out of a niche player role.\n* The limitations of commercial business data. With current data limitations, it's impossible for Square's current technology to be an efficient evaluator of which businesses can achieve explosive growth and which ones will never escape low margins. There are too many non-numerical variables in determining a profitable business. Data technology and AI is not there yet.\n* Personal finance inertia. For Square to disrupt the banking industry, they need some clear advantage over banks. Why should we do the extra work of switching over if we are at an established bank? I'm not saying Square wouldn't be a better option than a traditional bank, but it takes a lot to turn the tide in an industry as conservative as the banking industry.\n\nFeel free to refute any of these concerns, maybe there's something really compelling to Square that I'm not seeing. If I'm wrong, I'd love to know.",

        "selftext": "So we've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$AAPL, $MELI, $SRNE, $NVAX, $SQ, $NKLA, $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. Some alerts like **$TDOC** also did not pan out yesterday which just shows that the tool is not 100% perfect.\n\nThe tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.\n\nBullish    means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current     close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock is  expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.\n\n# Bullish Alerts\n\n**$ILMN** \\- Bullish probability of 88.43%. I know this dropped hard today but the tool is bullish on it. If it starts to go back, it will be a good setup. If it continue going down, don't get in. **Risky setup, careful!**\n\n**$NVAX** \\- Bullish probability of 77.14%. I like that it dropped today. Either get in if it touches the support at $160 and bounces back or get in on a pull back at the moving averages ([https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png](https://i.imgur.com/EXdP8y1.png))\n\n**$LULU** \\- Bullish probability of 74.80%. Seems like a good setup, especially with a small pullback ([https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png](https://i.imgur.com/5misOTH.png))\n\n**$FSLY** \\- Bullish probability of 74.46%. This dropped right at its 50 MA. A good setup as long as the price stays above 50MA ([https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png](https://i.imgur.com/GS9bBot.png)). Exit otherwise.\n\n# Bearish Alerts\n\n**$BAC** \\-  Bearish probability of 86.76%. I like it for a bearish setup if it can below the support of $25.2 ([https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png](https://i.imgur.com/wAiBWbo.png)).\n\n**$ZNGA** \\-  Bearish probability of 83.96%. This is at a very strong support level at $9.9. **Do not get in unless it breaks the support** ([https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png](https://i.imgur.com/kUJuBgr.png)).\n\n**$GILD** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.68%. Might go up a bit before going down further. Healthcare stocks are risky though so be careful.\n\n**$WDC** \\-  Bearish probability of 82.66%. Only a good setup if price stays below the support level of $37.8 ([https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png](https://i.imgur.com/8ky7k3v.png))\n\n \n\n**Note:**  A lot of time has gone into these tools and it takes time to write  these alerts, look at    charts, and post them here.

        "selftext": "Hello! Would really appreciate if I could get your feedback on my current portfolio / any advice on how to improve :)\n\nA bit of background on myself: I am 29 years old from Singapore and had put in about half my savings into 'safe' Singapore stocks pre-COVID (mainly local banks and the STI ETF) because my friends / family recommended that I do this (instead of leaving my money in the bank) years back when I was just starting out and had absolutely 0 knowledge about investing. I am currently down about US$11k but plan to keep the $ in for long term anyway.\n\nOnly at the height of COVID, some time in March, did I turn my attention to overseas exchanges (big regret starting so late). Since then I have pumped in about US$85k and to date I am up around US$14k overall. I mainly started with small positions to test the waters but added to my positions / bought new stocks over the last 4 months.\n\nThis is my current portfolio w rough stock weightage:\n\nSE 21% FVRR 13% PINS 8% NIO 7% TCEHY 7% AMZN 4% NFLX 4% BABA 3% GOOGL 3% FB 2% PDD 2% JD 2% ATVI 2% DIS 2% WDAY 2% MA 2% XOM 2% BP 2% V 1% MCD 1% AIR 1% KO 1% HLT 1% MAR 1% CINE 1% CCL 1% NCLH 1% DAL 1% PLAY 1% UAA 1%\n\nDisclaimer:\n\n* I know I have far too many stocks and am spread WAY too thin... have been wanting to trim and consolidate for a while. Admittedly I didn't really know what I was doing at the beginning and just bought small positions in many stocks :'(\n* I got greedy and bought some really bad stocks during the early June offline rally (i.e. airlines, cruises and PLAY) and I am kicking myself now. But hoping not to sell off any at a loss if possible to hold longer and wait for spikes\n* I am extremely bullish on tech, esp e-comm (clearly), mainly because I have been working in this industry and closely following big tech since I graduated from uni. Witnessed and experienced first-hand the rapid growth of e-comm in Southeast Asia and am very aware of the untapped potential. Unfortunately I had neither the foresight nor the gall to buy these stocks earlier\u2026\n* All the money I have invested has been accrued from years of working, saving, and being stingy lol + profits from a small e-comm side business I run -- none from my parents!",

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",
