We deliver reliable launch services, spacecraft components, satellites and other spacecraft and on-orbit management solutions that make it faster, easier and more affordable to access space. We believe that space has defined some of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements and it continues to shape our future. We are motivated by the impact we can have on Earth by making it easier to get to space and to use it as a platform for innovation, exploration and infrastructure.\n\nUnprecedented commercial investment and government expenditures are driving rapid growth in the space economy. As one of only two commercial companies delivering regular access to orbit, our proven launch vehicle, spacecraft technology and global infrastructure uniquely position us to capture this growing market. Advances in technologies, materials and components have led to miniaturization of satellites and a significant reduction in cost, while at the same time the need for space applications such as communications, remote sensing, Earth observation, meteorology and navigation is increasing. We provide customers with frequent, reliable and cost-effective access to orbit for this new generation of small satellites with Electron, a fully carbon composite launch vehicle powered by 3D printed engines. Since our first Electron launch in 2017 through July 2021, we have delivered 105 satellites to space across 18 successful orbital missions for commercial and government customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Reconnaissance Office, and a number of domestic and international commercial spacecraft operators including Blacksky Holdings, Canon, Capella Space, Planet, OHB Group and Synspective. We have also had two failed launches, including our most recent launch on July 29, 2021. Since our most recent failed launch, we have completed an extensive internal fault tree analysis, implemented corrective actions and received authorization from the FAA to resume launches. Our next launch is currently expected to occur in October 2021. In 2020, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and established us as the fourth most frequent launcher globally.\n\nRocket Lab\u2019s frequent launch cadence has been enabled through innovative manufacturing techniques for Electron, including 3D printing and automation, but production is only part of the formula for frequent and reliable launches. Our launch infrastructure is a key part of our success. We currently operate a private launch complex located in Mahia, New Zealand, which we refer to as Launch Complex 1. This launch complex is supported by a bi-lateral treaty between the United States and New Zealand governments that enables us to use U.S. launch and spacecraft technology for launches at Launch Complex 1 that otherwise would not be permitted for launches from foreign soil. This treaty provides us with a competitive advantage over other companies launching rockets from outside the U.S. that do not have the benefit of such a treaty. Additionally, by operating our own private launch complex, we do not have to share the launch complex with other launch providers and, subject to obtaining required regulatory clearances for launches, have complete control over launch schedule and availability. Launch Complex 1 serves as our high-volume launch complex, capable of supporting up to 120 missions every year. We also have access to use a dedicated launch pad at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island, Virginia, which we refer to as Launch Complex 2. We have built out all of the physical infrastructure that we need in order to use this launch complex and, upon certification of our flight termination system software by NASA, we will be able to begin scheduling launches from this launch complex. Rocket Lab\u2019s operations, including this launch complex as part of our overall business, have received the designation of Essential Critical Infrastructure for National Security from the U.S. Department of Defense, and can support 24-hour rapid call-up capability for defense needs and urgent constellation replenishment. We expect to be able to launch up to 12 missions per year from Launch Complex 2 once it becomes operational.\n\nBuilding on our strong foundation with Electron, we are now developing our Neutron launch vehicle, which will be an advanced 8-ton payload class launch vehicle tailored for large constellation deployments, interplanetary missions and human spaceflight. We expect constellation missions to make up an increasing percentage of small satellites launched, yet there is currently no commercial medium lift class launch vehicle to meet this demand. Neutron will be tailored to meet demand from this growing market.\n\nFrom launch services, Rocket Lab has expanded into space systems, delivering spacecraft as a service from low Earth orbit constellations to deep space and interplanetary missions for government and commercial customers. Our space services business utilizes our launch services, our family of Photon spacecraft and partnerships with global ground network service providers, as well as our own ground station network to provide customers a complete solution that encompasses spacecraft build, launch and on-orbit operation following launch.\n\n**Our Competitive Strengths**\n\nOur competitive strengths include:\n\n**Flight Heritage \u2013   First Mover Advantage:** Electron is the first small launch   vehicle to establish frequent and reliable access to space with 18 successful   orbital missions through July 2021. Successfully reaching orbit not just   once, but repeatedly delivering mission success across more than three years   of launches demonstrates a mature launch vehicle, sophisticated team and   robust manufacturing infrastructure and processes. We believe this gives us a   significant competitive advantage ahead of potential new competitors to   secure higher-value missions from our customer.\n\n**Unique   Technologies and Capabilities:** We have innovated around key   launch vehicle and spacecraft features and capabilities, including:\n\n* An all carbon   composite orbital launch vehicle, delivering substantial mass-savings while   maintaining strong structural integrity\n* A 3D printed,   electric-pump fed rocket engine that delivers high-performance while removing   the complexity associated with traditional gas turbine engines\n* A unique kick   stage that delivers satellites to precise and individual orbits increasing   deployment flexibility and cost effectiveness for our customers. The kick   stage can also be utilized as a fully- featured satellite, enabling hosted   payload opportunities for our customers and for our own constellation   applications.\n\n**Deep Vertical Integration:** We   have extensive vertically integrated design and manufacturing capabilities,   having developed world-class engineering and manufacturing teams across the   United States, New Zealand and Canada. This allows us to manage and control   almost every aspect of design, manufacturing and launch operations, enabling   rapid prototyping and streamlined production to deliver product to orbit   faster.\n\n**Additive   Manufacturing Capabilities:** We believe we were the first company to   3D print an orbital rocket engine, and as of July 2021 have flight heritage   with 220 engines launched to space. We leverage our unique 3D printing   capabilities beyond engines, to enable ultra-rapid design and testing of new   flight hardware and dramatically shorten our time-to-market.\n\n**Integrated Design   and Test Capabilities:** We own and operate our own propulsion   test infrastructure, allowing us the capacity and flexibility to accelerate   time-to-market and ensure quality and a high rate of mission success.\n\n**Private Launch   Complex:**   Rocket Lab operates its private orbital launch complex, Launch Complex 1 in   Mahia, New Zealand. This launch complex can support up to 120 launches every   year, which is significantly more than the current annual total number of   launches from all U.S. spaceports combined. By operating our own private   launch complex, we have eliminated the availability issues commonly faced by   other launch providers competing for a limited number of slots on shared   launch complexes that they do not control.\n\n**A complete   end-to-end space solution**: Providing services and data from space   has traditionally meant relying on multiple suppliers and mission partners.   By manufacturing and launching our own rockets, producing and operating our   own spacecraft, operating our own launch complexes, creating our own   spacecraft components and, through our partnerships, as well as our ground   station network, securing access to a global ground station network \u2013 Rocket   Lab has the keys to space. Having successfully proven all aspects of   accessing and using space, we are well positioned to move into delivering   space applications using our own established products and infrastructure.\n\n**Customers**\n\n***Launch Services.*** As of July 2021, we have launched and deployed 105 satellites for our customers, which includes government customers, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA and other U.S. government agencies. We also provide launch services to major domestic and international commercial spacecraft operators. Our launch services have been used by more than 20 organizations. U.S. Government customers have accounted for approximately 36% of the revenues through June 30, 2021 with commercial, foreign governments and education customers accounting for the remaining approximately 64%.\n\n***Space Systems***\\*\\*.\\*\\* As of December 31, 2020, we have flight hardware and spacecraft that has flown on over 70 missions, many involving multiple spacecrafts per mission, including legacy missions enabled by Sinclair Interplanetary, which we acquired in April 2020.\n\n**Our Growth Strategy**\n\nWe are pursuing the following growth strategies:\n\n* Leverage our   market position as the first U.S. commercially operational dedicated small   launch provider with NASA Category 1 certification, 18 successful launches,   and 105 satellite deployed, to be entrusted with increasingly critical   payloads and rewarded with higher-valued launch services contracts.\n* Expand our   addressable launch market with the development of the Neutron launch vehicle,   which will enable significantly higher revenue per launch with its capability   to deploy larger spacecraft and greater numbers of spacecraft per launch as   compared to our Electron launch vehicle, and will also be capable of   supporting crewed flight and cargo resupply to the International Space   Station, which our Electron launch vehicle is not capable of supporting.\n* Apply world-class   manufacturing scaling and cost-reduction capabilities to the production of   our existing family of component subsystems for satellites and other   spacecraft to capture large constellation design win opportunities.\n* Expand our   portfolio of strategic components for satellites and other spacecraft by   commercializing solutions developed for our launch vehicles and family of   Photon spacecraft, including; avionics subsystems, radios, batteries, solar   panels and separation systems.\n* Leverage our   proven Photon spacecraft platform to provide streamlined hosted payload and   technology demonstration capabilities in low Earth orbit to commercial and   government customers without the need for customers to utilize a separately   designed and built third-party satellite bus to place the satellite in the   correct position.\n* Build upon   ongoing interplanetary Photon spacecraft development efforts as well as our   announced Neutron launch vehicle developments to expand our addressable   market for interplanetary scientific and commercial missions.\n* Leverage our cost   and frequency advantaged \u201caccess to space,\u201d enabled by our established launch   assets and proven capabilities, to further penetrate the available market for   on-orbit management of previously launched satellites, which we believe to be   over $900 million per year, in addition to expanding our own spacecraft   assets on orbit to deliver and monetize space data with end-customers.\n* Exploit our   in-house launch and space systems capabilities to provide data and services   to the market with our own satellites launched by our own rockets.\n\n**Product &amp; Services Overview**\n\nWe design and manufacture small and medium-class rockets, satellite spacecraft components, satellites and other spacecraft to support the space economy. Our launch services are used to place spacecraft into Earth orbit and escape trajectories, and utilize orbital launch vehicles that place payloads into a variety of planes/inclinations and altitude trajectories. Our satellite and other spacecraft components are the building blocks for spacecraft that are sold commercially, which includes reaction wheels, star trackers, magnetic torque rods and batteries with additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions. Our family of Photon spacecraft is configurable for a range of low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit and interplanetary missions.\n\n* **Launch Services**: We   currently provide reliable and responsive launch services on Electron for   small spacecraft up to 300 kg. We also have a Neutron launch vehicle in   development to provide efficient constellation launch services for payloads   up to 8,000 kg. Between these two launch vehicles, we expect to have the   capability of launching nearly all of the satellites that we expect to be   launched through 2029. We can support up to 120 launch opportunities every   year, from Launch Complex 1, which is our private launch complex in Mahia,   New Zealand, and, upon certification of our flight termination system   software by NASA, will be able to begin scheduling additional launches from   Launch Complex 2 at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island,   Virginia.\n* **Space Systems**: We   provide spacecraft solutions for government and commercial customers ranging   from complete spacecraft development, manufacture and operation in low Earth   orbit and deep space to selling individual spacecraft components for use by   customers in constructing their own spacecraft. With our space systems   solutions, customers no longer need to build their own spacecraft. They can   buy a launch, spacecraft, ground services and on-orbit management following   launch as a complete package, streamlining their path to orbit.\n\n***Launch Services***\n\nWe design, manufacture and launch orbital rockets to deploy payloads to low Earth orbit and interplanetary destinations.\n\nElectron is our orbital small launch vehicle that was designed from the ground up to accommodate a high launch rate business model to meet the growing and dynamic needs of our customers for small launch services. Combining the use of innovative manufacturing technologies including 3D printing and automation, Electron is optimized for rapid and frequent launch and has established itself as one of the most prolific and reliable launch vehicles in the market. Since its maiden launch in 2017, Electron has become the leading small spacecraft launch vehicle delivering 105 satellites to orbit for government and commercial customers across 18 successful orbital missions through July 2021. In 2020, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and established Rocket Lab as the fourth most frequent launcher globally. Our launch services program has seen us develop many industry innovations, including 3D printed rocket engines, an electric-pump-fed rocket engine, fully carbon composite first stage fuel tanks, a private orbital launch complex, a rocket stage that converts into a spacecraft on orbit, and the ability to successfully recover a stage from space, providing a path to reusability.\n\nElectron provides tailored access to orbit for the high-growth small spacecraft market across dedicated and rideshare missions. It is capable of deploying satellites of up to 660 lbs (300 kg) to low Earth orbit across a wide range of orbital inclinations from 38 to 120 degrees. Electron is also capable of delivering spacecraft to deep space and interplanetary destinations, a capability which we will demonstrate in 2021 with the launch of a NASA mission to the Moon in support of the agency\u2019s Artemis program. Electron is a two-stage launch vehicle with a third kick stage, standing at 18 meters tall, with a diameter of 1.2 meters and a lift-off mass of approximately 14,000 kg. Electron\u2019s design includes innovative use of electrical systems and advanced carbon-composites for its structures and propellant tanks. Carbon-composite construction decreases mass by as much as 40 percent relative to other materials, contributing to Electron\u2019s mass-to-orbit performance. Our in-house assembly of Electron\u2019s composite tanks and structures improves cost efficiency and supports high rates of production. Electron\u2019s kick stage enables satellites to be placed in circular orbit after launch, which is necessary for satellites to maintain consistent altitude and is capable of engine restarts to deliver multiple payloads to a range of orbits, meeting precise orbit insertion requirements, and deorbiting itself to avoid contributing to orbital debris, also known as space junk.\n\nElectron is propelled by a total of ten Rutherford engines that we manufacture at our headquarters in Long Beach, California. The Rutherford engine is a 5,600-lbf engine fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene fed by electric pumps and is based on a propulsion cycle that makes use of electric motors and high-performance lithium polymer batteries to drive liquid oxygen and kerosene fuel pumps. Electric pumps are lower complexity than the turbomachinery typically required for gas generator cycles, yet still achieve high efficiency. We believe our Rutherford engine is the first oxygen/hydrocarbon engine to use additive manufacturing for all primary components, including the regeneratively cooled thrust chamber, injector pumps and main valves.\n\nElectron is currently launched from our private launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand and, upon certification of our flight termination system software by NASA, we plan to begin launching Electron from our new launch complex at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island, Virginia. As of July 2021, Electron had successfully launched 18 times and deployed 105 satellites to orbit. We have also had two failed launches. Since our most recent failed launch in May 2021, we have completed an extensive internal fault tree analysis, implemented corrective actions and received authorization from the FAA to resume launches. Our next launch currently is expected to occur in October 2021.\n\nIn March 2021, we announced plans to develop our reusable-ready medium-capacity Neutron launch vehicle which will increase the payload capacity of our space launch vehicles to approximately 17,000 lbs (8,000 kg), for launches to low-Earth orbit and lighter payloads into higher orbits. Neutron will be tailored for commercial and U.S. government constellation launches and capable of human space flight and cargo and crew resupply to the International Space Station. Neutron will also provide a dedicated service to orbit for larger civil, defense and commercial payloads that need a level of schedule control and high-flight cadence not available on large and heavy lift rockets. Neutron is expected to have the capability of launching nearly all of the spacecraft that we expect to be launched through 2029, and we expect to be able to leverage Electron\u2019s flight heritage, various vehicle subsystems designs, launch complexes and ground station infrastructure.\n\nThe medium-lift Neutron will be a two-stage launch vehicle that stands 46 meters (150 feet) tall with a 5-meter (16.4 ft) diameter fairing and a lift capacity of up to 8,000 kg (8 metric tons) to low-Earth orbit, 2,000 kg to the Moon (2 metric tons), and 1,500 kg to Mars and Venus (1.5 metric tons). Neutron will feature a reusable first stage designed to land on an ocean platform, enabling a higher launch cadence and decreased launch costs for customers. Neutron launches are planned to take place from Virginia\u2019s Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport located at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. We aim to leverage existing launch pad and integration infrastructure at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, with the goal of lessening the incremental investments in a new pad and accelerating the timeline to first launch, expected in 2024.\n\n***Space Systems***\n\nOur space systems product and services offerings include the Photon family of spacecraft, a portfolio of market and technology leading satellite and other spacecraft components, spacecraft engineering and design services, and on-orbit constellation management services.\n\nThe Photon family of small spacecraft is configurable for a range of low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit, and interplanetary missions. Photon is a versatile platform that can be adapted to meet a broad range of our customers\u2019 requirements. Photon can operate as the upper stage of Electron (the kick stage) during launch, then with a simple command it will transition to an operational satellite on orbit, eliminating the parasitic mass of deployed spacecraft and enabling full use of the fairing volume for payloads. Photon can also fly on other launch vehicles, such as our recently announced in-development Neutron launch vehicle, and as a secondary payload on rockets developed under the National Security Space Launch program of the U.S. Space Force. Our Photon family of spacecraft enable us to offer an end-to-end mission solution encompassing launch, spacecraft, ground services, and mission operations to provide customers with streamlined access to orbit with Rocket Lab as a single mission partner.\n\nOur family of Photon spacecraft can be used to conduct space-related scientific research, collect imagery and other remote-sensing data about the Earth, carry out lunar and other deep space planetary missions, and to demonstrate new space technologies. Our family of Photon spacecraft can also be used in combination with Electron to deploy individual spacecraft in different orbital locations and complete constellations in a single mission. Our spacecraft are intended for commercial, defense and civil government customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, other U.S. government agencies, and governments worldwide. Our first Photon spacecraft was successfully launched and placed into service in August 2020 and a second operational Photon was successfully launched in March 2021. Photon has been selected by NASA in 2021 for the CAPSTONE mission, which is a pathfinder for the lunar Gateway initiative of the Artemis program, which involves a mini- space station NASA intends to use as a staging point for crewed lunar landings beginning as soon as 2024. Photon has also been selected for interplanetary missions to Mars and Venus.\n\n***Spacecraft Components***\n\nRocket Lab designs and manufactures a range of components for satellites and other spacecraft, including reaction wheels, star trackers, magnetic torque rods and batteries, and has additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions. Rocket Lab entered this market with our acquisition of leading spacecraft components manufacturer Sinclair Interplanetary, which brought incremental vertically-integrated capabilities for our own spacecraft, and also enabled Rocket Lab to deliver high-volume manufacturing of critical spacecraft components at scale prices to the broader spacecraft merchant market.\n\nReaction wheels are motor-driven flywheels used to store angular momentum on a spacecraft. Many spacecrafts use three or four reaction wheels to provide agile 3-axis pointing control. Some configurations use a single wheel, called a \u201c**momentum wheel**,\u201d for stable Earth-pointing control. All Rocket Lab reaction wheels incorporate an onboard digital processor with speed and torque control loops. We make a large number of different wheel sizes. Wheels are sized by their maximum angular momentum measured in Newton-meters (Nm). Bigger spacecraft require bigger wheels, but determination of the correct size of wheel for a particular spacecraft requires detailed engineering analysis.\n\nStar trackers are optical sensors that determines the spacecraft\u2019s pointing direction and rotation rate by looking at the stars. Our star trackers are fully integrated units, where one box includes the lens, detector, processor, and all of the power supply and support circuits. A catalog of more than two million possible star triangles is loaded before launch, allowing the processor to determine the direction from any single image.\n\nMagnetic torque rods are long bars of special alloy steel, wound with coils of fine copper wire. When a current is passed through the wire, it becomes an electromagnet which generates a twisting force against the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Magnetic torque rods are used in low Earth orbit to remove angular momentum from reaction wheels, avoiding the requirement to expend irreplaceable propellant.\n\nBatteries include both the high-capacity high-voltage batteries used to power the pumps in the Rutherford rocket engine used by Electron and other batteries used for small spacecraft.\n\n**Spacecraft Engineering and Design Services and On-Orbit Constellation Management Services**\n\nOur space systems engineering team works with customers to develop, design and manufacture full spacecraft solutions from low Earth orbit to interplanetary spacecraft. We also offer constellation management services where we perform command and control operations and leverage our ground station infrastructure and partnerships to deliver data to spacecraft constellation operator customers following launch.\n\n**Space Applications**\n\nOur in-house launch and space systems capabilities provide significant competitive advantages for us to begin providing our own data and services from orbit. By leveraging our Electron and Neutron launch vehicles, our Photon family of spacecraft, our private launch complex and through partnerships with global ground network service providers, as well as our own ground station network, we are able to provide a complete, end-to-end solution. Rocket Lab is uniquely positioned to deploy its own satellite constellations to meet growing demand for space-based connectivity, Earth observation and other services. The space applications market represents significant untapped potential for value-added services including data management and analytics to support end customer insights.\n\n**Sales and Business Development and Mission Management**\n\nWe sell our launch services and space systems solutions through a unified global business development team that cross-sells across both launch and space systems and leverages shared technical, proposal writing, mission project management and administrative resources. This team is based primarily in the United States and focuses on government customers, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, other U.S. government agencies, as well as major domestic and international commercial satellite operators and satellite bus manufacturers. The business development team works closely with our engineering teams to develop optimal solutions for our customers. Given the well-defined and consolidated nature of our customer base, we are able to adequately address our market with a lean and focused team. This team also leads customer engagement in the procurement process, assisting with documentation related to the request for information or request for proposal process, as well as detailed customer-specific product configuration.\n\nMany of our business development team members have previously worked for government agencies and large institutional space and technology companies. They have in-depth knowledge and understanding of the industry and can draw on a vast network of contacts to support business development. With 18 successful orbital missions, 105 satellites deployed and a growing number of Rocket Lab-built spacecraft components operating on orbit, our team has a high-level of insight into customer requirements and evolving industry trends, putting us in a strong position to ensure our products and services meet customer needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Engineering***\n\nWe have made significant investments in our engineering teams. Our team members have a broad range of expertise from a range of industries including; aerospace, automotive, and marine, and broader manufacturing and technology. Rocket Lab\u2019s high level of vertical integration means that these engineering teams design and provide manufacturing support for components, sub-systems, and assemblies across the full range of our launch vehicles, our Photon family of spacecraft, our satellite, and other spacecraft components and our spacecraft engineering and design services. They support the full product lifecycle from new product innovation to sustaining engineering, including payload lift capacity increases and other performance improvements, new product features such as booster reusability and cost reduction initiatives.\n\nOur engineering teams across New Zealand, the United States, and Canada address all key areas of launch vehicle build, payload integration, launch operations, ground segment communications, on orbit spacecraft operations management, and satellite and other spacecraft component design and manufacturing. Key areas of technical focus include composite structures, additive manufacturing, machining, avionics and power systems, propulsion assembly and test, spacecraft system design assembly and test, printed circuit-board design, optics integration, guidance and navigation, attitude direction and command and control, amongst other engineering focus areas.\n\nThese teams are supported by centralized planning and program management functions that guide significant projects across Rocket Lab for consistency and visibility. The company leverages sophisticated product lifecycle management software tools, computer-aided design systems and business processes to drive efficiency and better manage the entire product lifecycle, including design, source and build the products the enable our launch services and end-product deliveries.\n\n**Supply Chain**\n\nWe are highly vertically integrated, in that we design and manufacture many components and subsystems for our launch vehicles, Photon family of spacecraft, and satellite and other spacecraft components we sell into the merchant market. To support this level of vertical integration we have developed extensive supply chain operations and capabilities that are global in nature and enabled by sophisticated third-party enterprise resource planning systems and tools. These systems and tools are largely supported by an in-house team of enterprise information systems personnel.\n\nWe obtain raw materials, components, sub-systems and capital equipment, and other supplies from suppliers that we believe to be reputable and reliable. We have established and follow internal quality control processes to source suppliers, considering engineering validation, quality, cost, delivery and lead-time. We have a quality management team that is responsible for managing and ensuring that supplied components meet quality standards. While we largely source raw materials and other inputs and services from multiple sources, in some cases we also purchase various inputs and services from a sole source. In those sole source supplier situations, as we endeavor to diversify our supply chain, we manage this sole source risk through carrying increased buffer stock, particularly on long-lead items.\n\n**Manufacturing, Assembly and Launch Operations**\n\nRocket Lab conducts global operations in support of its research and development manufacturing, assembly and launch operations. We have our Rutherford engines and avionics manufacturing facilities in Long Beach, California, composite manufacturing, high-voltage battery systems, and launch vehicle integration and propulsion testing in Auckland, New Zealand and launch complexes in Mahia, New Zealand and Wallops Island, Virginia. We strive to instill a manufacturing culture of continuous improvement and leverage best practices in quality control and worker safety across our facilities and have achieved Category-1 certification by the NASA Launch Services Program. We possess differentiated in-house rapid prototyping capabilities to support both research and development initiatives and to accelerate time-to-market benefits for critical production ramps. These capabilities include computer numerical control machining stations, balancing machines and 3D printers and related expertise.\n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held three issued U.S. patents and had nine U.S. patent applications pending. Our U.S. issued patents expire between 2032 and 2040. As of December 31, 2020, we held six registered trademarks in the United States, including the Rocket Lab mark, and also held 36 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.",

        "selftext": "So I made 15 K in a stock I had invested in about 2 years ago.\n\nIt took about a year and a half wait to finally be worth something. I didn\u2019t want to risk it by keeping it running longer. \n\nI live in an inner city in for my experience the job opportunities here aren\u2019t that. In January I have finally decided to sell my stock to buy a car as it would make it easier to travel and commute to work. I don\u2019t mind taking the bus I actually like it. But as a girl it can get really shady. Plus I found a job In a high-end restaurant that would usually end At around 2 Am- way past the time the buses would stop operating. \n\nSo I said fuck it and sold off my stock to get a car. It is about $8000 in total. It was probably pretty stupid of me to buy a car that expensive but it was under my mom\u2018s advice. It was a car that had 65K miles on it and it was only 10 years old. The rest of the money I used used to buy new work tire. \n\nEverything was going great. Up until I realized The job I had applied for was taking advantage of me. I had originally applied as a waitress. Again it was a high-end restaurant and I\u2019m busy nights such as Valentine\u2019s Day I would witness my coworkers leaving at night with $400 in their pocket. I don\u2019t know why but my bosses in the owners kept me in the back maybe because I was the only person willing to dish wash whenever we were short staffed or didn\u2019t have a dishwasher. \nI\u2019m talking nights where I leave at 3 AM and then be expected to come back at 11 to be the only person prepping for two or three hours until the other hard house people came in.\n\n\nAll while making $12 an hour, for essentially doing all the dirty work no one else had the guts to do. I\u2019m not socially inept. I just happen to suffer from partial hearing loss which can at times make me awkward. Plus the girl who reversed shadowed me when I first was was a waitress for the first time talk to me in the same cadence and tone that the popular girls in high school would talk to the special ed kids. So I didn\u2019t get the word in. \n\nExpenses were piling up. My bosses kept telling me to wait to be a waitress. But I realize that they were just taking advantage of me. \n\nA week before I quit, 6 months into this job,   was rear ended I am Man in a company work truck that they didn\u2019t insure because they had a previous DUI. The car was total loss and I only had gotten back 6000 from my insurance company which i done had to use to pay off my medical bills from issues back in 2019. I had a bunch of ovarian issues that caused a slew of issues. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what to say other than y\u2019all be careful out there",

My analysis can be seen [here](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/NNDM/6vX1sQH9-Bull-Bear-Neutral-Scenario-Predictions-NNDM/). Overall, I am incredibly bullish on the company in the long run and believe it will 10x in the coming years due to the growth of the financials alone. Considering how low the stock price currently is, now would be a phenomenal time to enter and cash in on potentially MASSIVE returns (which is why I have been averaging down the past months).",

We deliver reliable launch services, spacecraft components, satellites and other spacecraft and on-orbit management solutions that make it faster, easier and more affordable to access space. We believe that space has defined some of humanity\u2019s greatest achievements and it continues to shape our future. We are motivated by the impact we can have on Earth by making it easier to get to space and to use it as a platform for innovation, exploration and infrastructure.\n\nUnprecedented commercial investment and government expenditures are driving rapid growth in the space economy. As one of only two commercial companies delivering regular access to orbit, our proven launch vehicle, spacecraft technology and global infrastructure uniquely position us to capture this growing market. Advances in technologies, materials and components have led to miniaturization of satellites and a significant reduction in cost, while at the same time the need for space applications such as communications, remote sensing, Earth observation, meteorology and navigation is increasing. We provide customers with frequent, reliable and cost-effective access to orbit for this new generation of small satellites with Electron, a fully carbon composite launch vehicle powered by 3D printed engines. Since our first Electron launch in 2017 through July 2021, we have delivered 105 satellites to space across 18 successful orbital missions for commercial and government customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and a number of domestic and international commercial spacecraft operators including Blacksky Holdings, Canon, Capella Space, Planet, OHB Group and Synspective. We have also had two failed launches, including our most recent launch on July 29, 2021. Since our most recent failed launch, we have completed an extensive internal fault tree analysis, implemented corrective actions and received authorization from the FAA to resume launches. Our next launch is currently expected to occur in October 2021. In 2020, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and established us as the fourth most frequent launcher globally.\n\nRocket Lab\u2019s frequent launch cadence has been enabled through innovative manufacturing techniques for Electron, including 3D printing and automation, but production is only part of the formula for frequent and reliable launches. Our launch infrastructure is a key part of our success. We currently operate a private launch complex located in Mahia, New Zealand, which we refer to as Launch Complex 1. This launch complex is supported by a bi-lateral treaty between the United States and New Zealand governments that enables us to use U.S. launch and spacecraft technology for launches at Launch Complex 1 that otherwise would not be permitted for launches from foreign soil. This treaty provides us with a competitive advantage over other companies launching rockets from outside the U.S. that do not have the benefit of such a treaty. Additionally, by operating our own private launch complex, we do not have to share the launch complex with other launch providers and, subject to obtaining required regulatory clearances for launches, have complete control over launch schedule and availability. Launch Complex 1 serves as our high-volume launch complex, capable of supporting up to 120 missions every year. We also have access to use a dedicated launch pad at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island, Virginia, which we refer to as Launch Complex 2. We have built out all of the physical infrastructure that we need in order to use this launch complex and, upon certification of our flight termination system software by NASA, we will be able to begin scheduling launches from this launch complex. Rocket Lab\u2019s operations, including this launch complex as part of our overall business, have received the designation of Essential Critical Infrastructure for National Security from the U.S. Department of Defense, and can support 24-hour rapid call-up capability for defense needs and urgent constellation replenishment. We expect to be able to launch up to 12 missions per year from Launch Complex 2 once it becomes operational.\n\nBuilding on our strong foundation with Electron, we are now developing our Neutron launch vehicle, which will be an advanced 8-ton payload class launch vehicle tailored for large constellation deployments, interplanetary missions and human spaceflight. We expect constellation missions to make up an increasing percentage of small satellites launched, yet there is currently no commercial medium lift class launch vehicle to meet this demand. Neutron will be tailored to meet demand from this growing market.\n\nFrom launch services, Rocket Lab has expanded into space systems, delivering spacecraft as a service from low Earth orbit constellations to deep space and interplanetary missions for government and commercial customers. Our space services business utilizes our launch services, our family of Photon spacecraft and partnerships with global ground network service providers, as well as our own ground station network to provide customers a complete solution that encompasses spacecraft build, launch and on-orbit operation following launch.\n\n**Our Competitive Strengths**\n\nOur competitive strengths include:\n\n**Flight Heritage \u2013   First Mover Advantage:** Electron is the first small launch   vehicle to establish frequent and reliable access to space with 18 successful   orbital missions through July 2021. Successfully reaching orbit not just   once, but repeatedly delivering mission success across more than three years   of launches demonstrates a mature launch vehicle, sophisticated team and   robust manufacturing infrastructure and processes. We believe this gives us a   significant competitive advantage ahead of potential new competitors to   secure higher-value missions from our customer.\n\n**Unique   Technologies and Capabilities:** We have innovated around key   launch vehicle and spacecraft features and capabilities, including:\n\n* An all carbon   composite orbital launch vehicle, delivering substantial mass-savings while   maintaining strong structural integrity\n* A 3D printed,   electric-pump fed rocket engine that delivers high-performance while removing   the complexity associated with traditional gas turbine engines\n* A unique kick   stage that delivers satellites to precise and individual orbits increasing   deployment flexibility and cost effectiveness for our customers. The kick   stage can also be utilized as a fully- featured satellite, enabling hosted   payload opportunities for our customers and for our own constellation   applications.\n\n**Deep Vertical Integration:** We   have extensive vertically integrated design and manufacturing capabilities,   having developed world-class engineering and manufacturing teams across the   United States, New Zealand and Canada. This allows us to manage and control   almost every aspect of design, manufacturing and launch operations, enabling   rapid prototyping and streamlined production to deliver product to orbit   faster.\n\n**Additive   Manufacturing Capabilities:** We believe we were the first company to   3D print an orbital rocket engine, and as of July 2021 have flight heritage   with 220 engines launched to space. We leverage our unique 3D printing   capabilities beyond engines, to enable ultra-rapid design and testing of new   flight hardware and dramatically shorten our time-to-market.\n\n**Integrated Design   and Test Capabilities:** We own and operate our own propulsion   test infrastructure, allowing us the capacity and flexibility to accelerate   time-to-market and ensure quality and a high rate of mission success.\n\n**Private Launch   Complex:**   Rocket Lab operates its private orbital launch complex, Launch Complex 1 in   Mahia, New Zealand. This launch complex can support up to 120 launches every   year, which is significantly more than the current annual total number of   launches from all U.S. spaceports combined. By operating our own private   launch complex, we have eliminated the availability issues commonly faced by   other launch providers competing for a limited number of slots on shared   launch complexes that they do not control.\n\n**A complete   end-to-end space solution**: Providing services and data from space   has traditionally meant relying on multiple suppliers and mission partners.   By manufacturing and launching our own rockets, producing and operating our   own spacecraft, operating our own launch complexes, creating our own   spacecraft components and, through our partnerships, as well as our ground   station network, securing access to a global ground station network \u2013 Rocket   Lab has the keys to space. Having successfully proven all aspects of   accessing and using space, we are well positioned to move into delivering   space applications using our own established products and infrastructure.\n\n**Customers**\n\n***Launch Services.*** As of July 2021, we have launched and deployed 105 satellites for our customers, which includes government customers, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA and other U.S. government agencies. We also provide launch services to major domestic and international commercial spacecraft operators. Our launch services have been used by more than 20 organizations. U.S. Government customers have accounted for approximately 36% of the revenues through June 30, 2021 with commercial, foreign governments and education customers accounting for the remaining approximately 64%.\n\n***Space Systems*****.** As of December 31, 2020, we have flight hardware and spacecraft that has flown on over 70 missions, many involving multiple spacecrafts per mission, including legacy missions enabled by Sinclair Interplanetary, which we acquired in April 2020.\n\n**Our Growth Strategy**\n\nWe are pursuing the following growth strategies:\n\n* Leverage our   market position as the first U.S. commercially operational dedicated small   launch provider with NASA Category 1 certification, 18 successful launches,   and 105 satellite deployed, to be entrusted with increasingly critical   payloads and rewarded with higher-valued launch services contracts.\n* Expand our   addressable launch market with the development of the Neutron launch vehicle,   which will enable significantly higher revenue per launch with its capability   to deploy larger spacecraft and greater numbers of spacecraft per launch as   compared to our Electron launch vehicle, and will also be capable of   supporting crewed flight and cargo resupply to the International Space   Station, which our Electron launch vehicle is not capable of supporting.\n* Apply world-class   manufacturing scaling and cost-reduction capabilities to the production of   our existing family of component subsystems for satellites and other   spacecraft to capture large constellation design win opportunities.\n* Expand our   portfolio of strategic components for satellites and other spacecraft by   commercializing solutions developed for our launch vehicles and family of   Photon spacecraft, including; avionics subsystems, radios, batteries, solar   panels and separation systems.\n* Leverage our   proven Photon spacecraft platform to provide streamlined hosted payload and   technology demonstration capabilities in low Earth orbit to commercial and   government customers without the need for customers to utilize a separately   designed and built third-party satellite bus to place the satellite in the   correct position.\n* Build upon   ongoing interplanetary Photon spacecraft development efforts as well as our   announced Neutron launch vehicle developments to expand our addressable   market for interplanetary scientific and commercial missions.\n* Leverage our cost   and frequency advantaged \u201caccess to space,\u201d enabled by our established launch   assets and proven capabilities, to further penetrate the available market for   on-orbit management of previously launched satellites, which we believe to be   over $900 million per year, in addition to expanding our own spacecraft   assets on orbit to deliver and monetize space data with end-customers.\n* Exploit our   in-house launch and space systems capabilities to provide data and services   to the market with our own satellites launched by our own rockets.\n\n**Product &amp; Services Overview**\n\nWe design and manufacture small and medium-class rockets, satellite spacecraft components, satellites and other spacecraft to support the space economy. Our launch services are used to place spacecraft into Earth orbit and escape trajectories, and utilize orbital launch vehicles that place payloads into a variety of planes/inclinations and altitude trajectories. Our satellite and other spacecraft components are the building blocks for spacecraft that are sold commercially, which includes reaction wheels, star trackers, magnetic torque rods and batteries with additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions. Our family of Photon spacecraft is configurable for a range of low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit and interplanetary missions.\n\n* **Launch Services**: We   currently provide reliable and responsive launch services on Electron for   small spacecraft up to 300 kg. We also have a Neutron launch vehicle in   development to provide efficient constellation launch services for payloads   up to 8,000 kg. Between these two launch vehicles, we expect to have the   capability of launching nearly all of the satellites that we expect to be   launched through 2029. We can support up to 120 launch opportunities every   year, from Launch Complex 1, which is our private launch complex in Mahia,   New Zealand, and, upon certification of our flight termination system   software by NASA, will be able to begin scheduling additional launches from   Launch Complex 2 at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island,   Virginia.\n* **Space Systems**: We   provide spacecraft solutions for government and commercial customers ranging   from complete spacecraft development, manufacture and operation in low Earth   orbit and deep space to selling individual spacecraft components for use by   customers in constructing their own spacecraft. With our space systems   solutions, customers no longer need to build their own spacecraft. They can   buy a launch, spacecraft, ground services and on-orbit management following   launch as a complete package, streamlining their path to orbit.\n\n  \n\n***Launch Services***\n\nWe design, manufacture and launch orbital rockets to deploy payloads to low Earth orbit and interplanetary destinations.\n\nElectron is our orbital small launch vehicle that was designed from the ground up to accommodate a high launch rate business model to meet the growing and dynamic needs of our customers for small launch services. Combining the use of innovative manufacturing technologies including 3D printing and automation, Electron is optimized for rapid and frequent launch and has established itself as one of the most prolific and reliable launch vehicles in the market. Since its maiden launch in 2017, Electron has become the leading small spacecraft launch vehicle delivering 105 satellites to orbit for government and commercial customers across 18 successful orbital missions through July 2021. In 2020, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and established Rocket Lab as the fourth most frequent launcher globally. Our launch services program has seen us develop many industry innovations, including 3D printed rocket engines, an electric-pump-fed rocket engine, fully carbon composite first stage fuel tanks, a private orbital launch complex, a rocket stage that converts into a spacecraft on orbit, and the ability to successfully recover a stage from space, providing a path to reusability.\n\nElectron provides tailored access to orbit for the high-growth small spacecraft market across dedicated and rideshare missions. It is capable of deploying satellites of up to 660 lbs (300 kg) to low Earth orbit across a wide range of orbital inclinations from 38 to 120 degrees. Electron is also capable of delivering spacecraft to deep space and interplanetary destinations, a capability which we will demonstrate in 2021 with the launch of a NASA mission to the Moon in support of the agency\u2019s Artemis program. Electron is a two-stage launch vehicle with a third kick stage, standing at 18 meters tall, with a diameter of 1.2 meters and a lift-off mass of approximately 14,000 kg. Electron\u2019s design includes innovative use of electrical systems and advanced carbon-composites for its structures and propellant tanks. Carbon-composite construction decreases mass by as much as 40 percent relative to other materials, contributing to Electron\u2019s mass-to-orbit performance. Our in-house assembly of Electron\u2019s composite tanks and structures improves cost efficiency and supports high rates of production. Electron\u2019s kick stage enables satellites to be placed in circular orbit after launch, which is necessary for satellites to maintain consistent altitude and is capable of engine restarts to deliver multiple payloads to a range of orbits, meeting precise orbit insertion requirements, and deorbiting itself to avoid contributing to orbital debris, also known as space junk.\n\nElectron is propelled by a total of ten Rutherford engines that we manufacture at our headquarters in Long Beach, California. The Rutherford engine is a 5,600-lbf engine fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene fed by electric pumps and is based on a propulsion cycle that makes use of electric motors and high-performance lithium polymer batteries to drive liquid oxygen and kerosene fuel pumps. Electric pumps are lower complexity than the turbomachinery typically required for gas generator cycles, yet still achieve high efficiency. We believe our Rutherford engine is the first oxygen/hydrocarbon engine to use additive manufacturing for all primary components, including the regeneratively cooled thrust chamber, injector pumps and main valves.\n\nElectron is currently launched from our private launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand and, upon certification of our flight termination system software by NASA, we plan to begin launching Electron from our new launch complex at NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island, Virginia. As of July 2021, Electron had successfully launched 18 times and deployed 105 satellites to orbit. We have also had two failed launches. Since our most recent failed launch in May 2021, we have completed an extensive internal fault tree analysis, implemented corrective actions and received authorization from the FAA to resume launches. Our next launch currently is expected to occur in October 2021.\n\nIn March 2021, we announced plans to develop our reusable-ready medium-capacity Neutron launch vehicle which will increase the payload capacity of our space launch vehicles to approximately 17,000 lbs (8,000 kg), for launches to low-Earth orbit and lighter payloads into higher orbits. Neutron will be tailored for commercial and U.S. government constellation launches and capable of human space flight and cargo and crew resupply to the International Space Station. Neutron will also provide a dedicated service to orbit for larger civil, defense and commercial payloads that need a level of schedule control and high-flight cadence not available on large and heavy lift rockets. Neutron is expected to have the capability of launching nearly all of the spacecraft that we expect to be launched through 2029, and we expect to be able to leverage Electron\u2019s flight heritage, various vehicle subsystems designs, launch complexes and ground station infrastructure.\n\nThe medium-lift Neutron will be a two-stage launch vehicle that stands 46 meters (150 feet) tall with a 5-meter (16.4 ft) diameter fairing and a lift capacity of up to 8,000 kg (8 metric tons) to low-Earth orbit, 2,000 kg to the Moon (2 metric tons), and 1,500 kg to Mars and Venus (1.5 metric tons). Neutron will feature a reusable first stage designed to land on an ocean platform, enabling a higher launch cadence and decreased launch costs for customers. Neutron launches are planned to take place from Virginia\u2019s Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport located at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. We aim to leverage existing launch pad and integration infrastructure at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, with the goal of lessening the incremental investments in a new pad and accelerating the timeline to first launch, expected in 2024. \n\n***Space Systems***\n\nOur space systems product and services offerings include the Photon family of spacecraft, a portfolio of market and technology leading satellite and other spacecraft components, spacecraft engineering and design services, and on-orbit constellation management services.\n\nThe Photon family of small spacecraft is configurable for a range of low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit, and interplanetary missions. Photon is a versatile platform that can be adapted to meet a broad range of our customers\u2019 requirements. Photon can operate as the upper stage of Electron (the kick stage) during launch, then with a simple command it will transition to an operational satellite on orbit, eliminating the parasitic mass of deployed spacecraft and enabling full use of the fairing volume for payloads. Photon can also fly on other launch vehicles, such as our recently announced in-development Neutron launch vehicle, and as a secondary payload on rockets developed under the National Security Space Launch program of the U.S. Space Force. Our Photon family of spacecraft enable us to offer an end-to-end mission solution encompassing launch, spacecraft, ground services, and mission operations to provide customers with streamlined access to orbit with Rocket Lab as a single mission partner.\n\nOur family of Photon spacecraft can be used to conduct space-related scientific research, collect imagery and other remote-sensing data about the Earth, carry out lunar and other deep space planetary missions, and to demonstrate new space technologies. Our family of Photon spacecraft can also be used in combination with Electron to deploy individual spacecraft in different orbital locations and complete constellations in a single mission. Our spacecraft are intended for commercial, defense and civil government customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, other U.S. government agencies, and governments worldwide. Our first Photon spacecraft was successfully launched and placed into service in August 2020 and a second operational Photon was successfully launched in March 2021. Photon has been selected by NASA in 2021 for the CAPSTONE mission, which is a pathfinder for the lunar Gateway initiative of the Artemis program, which involves a mini- space station NASA intends to use as a staging point for crewed lunar landings beginning as soon as 2024. Photon has also been selected for interplanetary missions to Mars and Venus.\n\n***Spacecraft Components***\n\nRocket Lab designs and manufactures a range of components for satellites and other spacecraft, including reaction wheels, star trackers, magnetic torque rods and batteries, and has additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions. Rocket Lab entered this market with our acquisition of leading spacecraft components manufacturer Sinclair Interplanetary, which brought incremental vertically-integrated capabilities for our own spacecraft, and also enabled Rocket Lab to deliver high-volume manufacturing of critical spacecraft components at scale prices to the broader spacecraft merchant market.\n\nReaction wheels are motor-driven flywheels used to store angular momentum on a spacecraft. Many spacecrafts use three or four reaction wheels to provide agile 3-axis pointing control. Some configurations use a single wheel, called a \u201c**momentum wheel**,\u201d for stable Earth-pointing control. All Rocket Lab reaction wheels incorporate an onboard digital processor with speed and torque control loops. We make a large number of different wheel sizes. Wheels are sized by their maximum angular momentum measured in Newton-meters (Nm). Bigger spacecraft require bigger wheels, but determination of the correct size of wheel for a particular spacecraft requires detailed engineering analysis.\n\nStar trackers are optical sensors that determines the spacecraft\u2019s pointing direction and rotation rate by looking at the stars. Our star trackers are fully integrated units, where one box includes the lens, detector, processor, and all of the power supply and support circuits. A catalog of more than two million possible star triangles is loaded before launch, allowing the processor to determine the direction from any single image.\n\nMagnetic torque rods are long bars of special alloy steel, wound with coils of fine copper wire. When a current is passed through the wire, it becomes an electromagnet which generates a twisting force against the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Magnetic torque rods are used in low Earth orbit to remove angular momentum from reaction wheels, avoiding the requirement to expend irreplaceable propellant.\n\nBatteries include both the high-capacity high-voltage batteries used to power the pumps in the Rutherford rocket engine used by Electron and other batteries used for small spacecraft.\n\n**Spacecraft Engineering and Design Services and On-Orbit Constellation Management Services**\n\nOur space systems engineering team works with customers to develop, design and manufacture full spacecraft solutions from low Earth orbit to interplanetary spacecraft. We also offer constellation management services where we perform command and control operations and leverage our ground station infrastructure and partnerships to deliver data to spacecraft constellation operator customers following launch.\n\n**Space Applications**\n\nOur in-house launch and space systems capabilities provide significant competitive advantages for us to begin providing our own data and services from orbit. By leveraging our Electron and Neutron launch vehicles, our Photon family of spacecraft, our private launch complex and through partnerships with global ground network service providers, as well as our own ground station network, we are able to provide a complete, end-to-end solution. Rocket Lab is uniquely positioned to deploy its own satellite constellations to meet growing demand for space-based connectivity, Earth observation and other services. The space applications market represents significant untapped potential for value-added services including data management and analytics to support end customer insights.\n\n**Sales and Business Development and Mission Management**\n\nWe sell our launch services and space systems solutions through a unified global business development team that cross-sells across both launch and space systems and leverages shared technical, proposal writing, mission project management and administrative resources. This team is based primarily in the United States and focuses on government customers, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, other U.S. government agencies, as well as major domestic and international commercial satellite operators and satellite bus manufacturers. The business development team works closely with our engineering teams to develop optimal solutions for our customers. Given the well-defined and consolidated nature of our customer base, we are able to adequately address our market with a lean and focused team. This team also leads customer engagement in the procurement process, assisting with documentation related to the request for information or request for proposal process, as well as detailed customer-specific product configuration.\n\nMany of our business development team members have previously worked for government agencies and large institutional space and technology companies. They have in-depth knowledge and understanding of the industry and can draw on a vast network of contacts to support business development. With 18 successful orbital missions, 105 satellites deployed and a growing number of Rocket Lab-built spacecraft components operating on orbit, our team has a high-level of insight into customer requirements and evolving industry trends, putting us in a strong position to ensure our products and services meet customer needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Engineering***\n\nWe have made significant investments in our engineering teams. Our team members have a broad range of expertise from a range of industries including; aerospace, automotive, and marine, and broader manufacturing and technology. Rocket Lab\u2019s high level of vertical integration means that these engineering teams design and provide manufacturing support for components, sub-systems, and assemblies across the full range of our launch vehicles, our Photon family of spacecraft, our satellite, and other spacecraft components and our spacecraft engineering and design services. They support the full product lifecycle from new product innovation to sustaining engineering, including payload lift capacity increases and other performance improvements, new product features such as booster reusability and cost reduction initiatives.\n\nOur engineering teams across New Zealand, the United States, and Canada address all key areas of launch vehicle build, payload integration, launch operations, ground segment communications, on orbit spacecraft operations management, and satellite and other spacecraft component design and manufacturing. Key areas of technical focus include composite structures, additive manufacturing, machining, avionics and power systems, propulsion assembly and test, spacecraft system design assembly and test, printed circuit-board design, optics integration, guidance and navigation, attitude direction and command and control, amongst other engineering focus areas.\n\nThese teams are supported by centralized planning and program management functions that guide significant projects across Rocket Lab for consistency and visibility. The company leverages sophisticated product lifecycle management software tools, computer-aided design systems and business processes to drive efficiency and better manage the entire product lifecycle, including design, source and build the products the enable our launch services and end-product deliveries.\n\n**Supply Chain**\n\nWe are highly vertically integrated, in that we design and manufacture many components and subsystems for our launch vehicles, Photon family of spacecraft, and satellite and other spacecraft components we sell into the merchant market. To support this level of vertical integration we have developed extensive supply chain operations and capabilities that are global in nature and enabled by sophisticated third-party enterprise resource planning systems and tools. These systems and tools are largely supported by an in-house team of enterprise information systems personnel.\n\nWe obtain raw materials, components, sub-systems and capital equipment, and other supplies from suppliers that we believe to be reputable and reliable. We have established and follow internal quality control processes to source suppliers, considering engineering validation, quality, cost, delivery and lead-time. We have a quality management team that is responsible for managing and ensuring that supplied components meet quality standards. While we largely source raw materials and other inputs and services from multiple sources, in some cases we also purchase various inputs and services from a sole source. In those sole source supplier situations, as we endeavor to diversify our supply chain, we manage this sole source risk through carrying increased buffer stock, particularly on long-lead items.\n\n**Manufacturing, Assembly and Launch Operations**\n\nRocket Lab conducts global operations in support of its research and development manufacturing, assembly and launch operations. We have our Rutherford engines and avionics manufacturing facilities in Long Beach, California, composite manufacturing, high-voltage battery systems, and launch vehicle integration and propulsion testing in Auckland, New Zealand and launch complexes in Mahia, New Zealand and Wallops Island, Virginia. We strive to instill a manufacturing culture of continuous improvement and leverage best practices in quality control and worker safety across our facilities and have achieved Category-1 certification by the NASA Launch Services Program. We possess differentiated in-house rapid prototyping capabilities to support both research and development initiatives and to accelerate time-to-market benefits for critical production ramps. These capabilities include computer numerical control machining stations, balancing machines and 3D printers and related expertise.\n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held three issued U.S. patents and had nine U.S. patent applications pending. Our U.S. issued patents expire between 2032 and 2040. As of December 31, 2020, we held six registered trademarks in the United States, including the Rocket Lab mark, and also held 36 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.",

        "selftext": "Dear Mod(s), \n\nI know this is a risky play but I'm submitting a request for a flair change of my choice. You can wait till later this month, but please consider...\ud83e\ude82Double Birds\ud83e\ude82...thank you. *see explanation at the end*\n\nOk on to the Double Down. I'm back with this three ape flair to tell you to consider starting a position in Rocket Lab(RKLB). Do some due diligence yourselves, but I'll give you an interesting exercise. Look at the chart, see that it's hit a high of +$21 and has since pulled back 40%. Look what day that latest low was. Then check my past comments to see if I made an interesting observation(I said it around 12:30pm if you're that curious).\n\nIt's a holiday so I'm going to keep this short, there's plenty to see in my comments. Some sobering facts and some wild speculation. And yeah...I might be a little hooked.\n\nSo recently New Zealand has eased its covid restrictions and Rocket Lab plans on getting back to launching. **November 11th-24th** is their next launch window. The way those work is they keep a broad window, but try to launch on the earliest day with the best weather conditions. They also have a second launch planned shortly after, this will be their first attempt at such a fast cadence. Squeezed in their is a quarterly report on the **15th**. This quarter they were in lockdown so you bears might want to sit at the card table with me. I still believe they will spin positive news from a recent US Space Force contract to pay for about an 1/8 of the cost of their next rocket they're designing. Also acquisition which bolsters the company's Space Systems capabilities. So it's hard to see how this will go.\n\nSome analysis. The volume has been incredibly low this week, and the price has still trended up slowly. An increase in volume will push this price like last time, but I'm not sure which way. I choose up. Daily RSI may be driving the decisions of the institutions holding this stock, currently it's a few points above 50...sorry I didn't post this sooner. Don't everyone enter the capsule at once, this week may still have some slight dips.\n\nDisclosure: I have a combination of shares and warrants that are  a little north of 10,000. I have a few dozen November  and December calls as well($15)....[It's a Sunday, you have time to research](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/)\n\n*The reason I like \ud83e\ude82Double Birds\ud83e\ude82 is because of this cautious risk taker named Joseph \"Red\" Kittenger.  He sort of symbolizes my current tolerance in the market. I just came across a video of his famous high altitude jump in 1960. I've read and watched a lot on the guy over the years, but this is the first time I saw something I never saw before. It happens at the end of [this](https://youtu.be/Qw8OJJQ_hgk) video. Other versions of this video cut out this part at the end. You'll notice the guy helping him out of his equipment flash Red the double birds before giving him a friendly slap on the cheek. That's one of those \"picture worth a million words\" moments*\n\nHappy Halloween \ud83c\udf83",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, October 7th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-oct-7.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow set to jump as optimism builds for a debt celling deal\n\n&gt; * Dow futures rose 300 points Thursday as Democratic senators signaled they were receptive to a debt ceiling offer from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell that would allow an emergency increase into December. Optimism about a possible deal swung Wall Street from sharp early Wednesday losses to modest gains at the close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. All three benchmarks were tracking Thursday for three-session winning streaks after October started off with sharp back-and-forth losses and gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Bond yields steady ahead of jobs data Thursday and Friday\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield was steady Thursday and remained above 1.5% ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s weekly look at initial jobless claims. Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits of 345,000 for the week ended Oct. 2. That would represent a decline from the prior week\u2019s 362,000 new claims. The government issues its September employment report Friday. ADP\u2019s look at private sector hiring trends last month, released Wednesday, came in stronger than expected.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. McConnell wants to give Dems time to act alone on debt ceiling\n\n&gt; * McConnell late Wednesday said his debt ceiling offer would give Democrats time to use their majorities on Capitol Hill to craft a bill to raise the borrowing limit on their own without Republican votes. The deadline to take action on the debt limit and avoid a U.S. credit default is Oct. 18. If Democrats accept McConnell\u2019s offer, lawmakers will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Biden to tout Covid vaccine mandates for large companies\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden on Thursday is set to visit Chicago to meet with United Airlines\u2019 CEO and local Democratic leaders as he touts his decision to impose Covid vaccine mandates on employees of large firms. Biden last month ordered all federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated, with few exceptions. For private employers with 100 or more workers, he proposed requiring employees to be vaccinated or tested weekly.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Vo59jFh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GJeD64S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/jOXOlTL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/tJQWMi2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aubwMW2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/OzxnSxg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/HWJrQ2Q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/neRXcjH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zUrPe1n.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ObyqJeV.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TWyaNal.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/zVn77eO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4leusp2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vX61Ler.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/tEvAL0v.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-conagra-tilray-levi-twitter-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Conagra Brands (CAG)** \u2013 The company behind food brands like Healthy Choice, Hunt\u2019s and Hebrew National earned an adjusted 50 cents per share for its latest quarter, 1 cent above estimates, while revenue also came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, October 7th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-oct-7.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow set to jump as optimism builds for a debt celling deal\n\n&gt; * Dow futures rose 300 points Thursday as Democratic senators signaled they were receptive to a debt ceiling offer from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell that would allow an emergency increase into December. Optimism about a possible deal swung Wall Street from sharp early Wednesday losses to modest gains at the close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. All three benchmarks were tracking Thursday for three-session winning streaks after October started off with sharp back-and-forth losses and gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Bond yields steady ahead of jobs data Thursday and Friday\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield was steady Thursday and remained above 1.5% ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s weekly look at initial jobless claims. Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits of 345,000 for the week ended Oct. 2. That would represent a decline from the prior week\u2019s 362,000 new claims. The government issues its September employment report Friday. ADP\u2019s look at private sector hiring trends last month, released Wednesday, came in stronger than expected.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. McConnell wants to give Dems time to act alone on debt ceiling\n\n&gt; * McConnell late Wednesday said his debt ceiling offer would give Democrats time to use their majorities on Capitol Hill to craft a bill to raise the borrowing limit on their own without Republican votes. The deadline to take action on the debt limit and avoid a U.S. credit default is Oct. 18. If Democrats accept McConnell\u2019s offer, lawmakers will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Biden to tout Covid vaccine mandates for large companies\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden on Thursday is set to visit Chicago to meet with United Airlines\u2019 CEO and local Democratic leaders as he touts his decision to impose Covid vaccine mandates on employees of large firms. Biden last month ordered all federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated, with few exceptions. For private employers with 100 or more workers, he proposed requiring employees to be vaccinated or tested weekly.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. George Soros\u2019 fund owns \u2018some\u2019 bitcoin, CEO of the fund confirms\n\n&gt; * Soros Fund Management, the asset management company founded by billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, has revealed it owns the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The family office owns \u201csome coins \u2026 but not a lot,\u201d Dawn Fitzpatrick, CEO and chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management, said in an interview at a Bloomberg event this week. While lower Thursday, bitcoin has staged a comeback in recent days, trading above $54,000.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Vo59jFh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GJeD64S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/jOXOlTL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/tJQWMi2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aubwMW2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/OzxnSxg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/HWJrQ2Q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/neRXcjH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zUrPe1n.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ObyqJeV.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TWyaNal.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/zVn77eO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4leusp2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vX61Ler.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/tEvAL0v.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* TLRY\n* MRNA\n* BABA\n* NRXP\n* NURO\n* CCXI\n* XLM.X\n* BNTX\n* MNKD\n* NIO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-conagra-tilray-levi-twitter-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Conagra Brands (CAG)** \u2013 The company behind food brands like Healthy Choice, Hunt\u2019s and Hebrew National earned an adjusted 50 cents per share for its latest quarter, 1 cent above estimates, while revenue also came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts.

Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits of 345,000 for the week ended Oct. 2. That would represent a decline from the prior week\u2019s 362,000 new claims. The government issues its September employment report Friday. ADP\u2019s look at private sector hiring trends last month, released Wednesday, came in stronger than expected.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. McConnell wants to give Dems time to act alone on debt ceiling\n\n&gt; * McConnell late Wednesday said his debt ceiling offer would give Democrats time to use their majorities on Capitol Hill to craft a bill to raise the borrowing limit on their own without Republican votes. The deadline to take action on the debt limit and avoid a U.S. credit default is Oct. 18. If Democrats accept McConnell\u2019s offer, lawmakers will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Biden to tout Covid vaccine mandates for large companies\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden on Thursday is set to visit Chicago to meet with United Airlines\u2019 CEO and local Democratic leaders as he touts his decision to impose Covid vaccine mandates on employees of large firms. Biden last month ordered all federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated, with few exceptions. For private employers with 100 or more workers, he proposed requiring employees to be vaccinated or tested weekly.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Vo59jFh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GJeD64S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/jOXOlTL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/tJQWMi2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aubwMW2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/OzxnSxg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/HWJrQ2Q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/neRXcjH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zUrPe1n.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ObyqJeV.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TWyaNal.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/zVn77eO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4leusp2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vX61Ler.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/tEvAL0v.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-conagra-tilray-levi-twitter-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Conagra Brands (CAG)** \u2013 The company behind food brands like Healthy Choice, Hunt\u2019s and Hebrew National earned an adjusted 50 cents per share for its latest quarter, 1 cent above estimates, while revenue also came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts.

Dow set to jump as optimism builds for a debt celling deal\n\n&gt; * Dow futures rose 300 points Thursday as Democratic senators signaled they were receptive to a debt ceiling offer from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell that would allow an emergency increase into December. Optimism about a possible deal swung Wall Street from sharp early Wednesday losses to modest gains at the close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. All three benchmarks were tracking Thursday for three-session winning streaks after October started off with sharp back-and-forth losses and gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2.

Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits of 345,000 for the week ended Oct. 2. That would represent a decline from the prior week\u2019s 362,000 new claims.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, October 7th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-oct-7.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow set to jump as optimism builds for a debt celling deal\n\n&gt; * Dow futures rose 300 points Thursday as Democratic senators signaled they were receptive to a debt ceiling offer from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell that would allow an emergency increase into December. Optimism about a possible deal swung Wall Street from sharp early Wednesday losses to modest gains at the close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. All three benchmarks were tracking Thursday for three-session winning streaks after October started off with sharp back-and-forth losses and gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Bond yields steady ahead of jobs data Thursday and Friday\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield was steady Thursday and remained above 1.5% ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s weekly look at initial jobless claims. Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits of 345,000 for the week ended Oct. 2. That would represent a decline from the prior week\u2019s 362,000 new claims. The government issues its September employment report Friday. ADP\u2019s look at private sector hiring trends last month, released Wednesday, came in stronger than expected.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. McConnell wants to give Dems time to act alone on debt ceiling\n\n&gt; * McConnell late Wednesday said his debt ceiling offer would give Democrats time to use their majorities on Capitol Hill to craft a bill to raise the borrowing limit on their own without Republican votes. The deadline to take action on the debt limit and avoid a U.S. credit default is Oct. 18. If Democrats accept McConnell\u2019s offer, lawmakers will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Biden to tout Covid vaccine mandates for large companies\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden on Thursday is set to visit Chicago to meet with United Airlines\u2019 CEO and local Democratic leaders as he touts his decision to impose Covid vaccine mandates on employees of large firms. Biden last month ordered all federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated, with few exceptions. For private employers with 100 or more workers, he proposed requiring employees to be vaccinated or tested weekly.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Vo59jFh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GJeD64S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/jOXOlTL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/tJQWMi2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aubwMW2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/OzxnSxg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/HWJrQ2Q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/neRXcjH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zUrPe1n.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ObyqJeV.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TWyaNal.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/zVn77eO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4leusp2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vX61Ler.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/tEvAL0v.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-conagra-tilray-levi-twitter-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Conagra Brands (CAG)** \u2013 The company behind food brands like Healthy Choice, Hunt\u2019s and Hebrew National earned an adjusted 50 cents per share for its latest quarter, 1 cent above estimates, while revenue also came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, October 7th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-oct-7.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow set to jump as optimism builds for a debt celling deal\n\n&gt; * Dow futures rose 300 points Thursday as Democratic senators signaled they were receptive to a debt ceiling offer from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell that would allow an emergency increase into December. Optimism about a possible deal swung Wall Street from sharp early Wednesday losses to modest gains at the close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. All three benchmarks were tracking Thursday for three-session winning streaks after October started off with sharp back-and-forth losses and gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Bond yields steady ahead of jobs data Thursday and Friday\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield was steady Thursday and remained above 1.5% ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s weekly look at initial jobless claims. Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits of 345,000 for the week ended Oct. 2. That would represent a decline from the prior week\u2019s 362,000 new claims. The government issues its September employment report Friday. ADP\u2019s look at private sector hiring trends last month, released Wednesday, came in stronger than expected.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. McConnell wants to give Dems time to act alone on debt ceiling\n\n&gt; * McConnell late Wednesday said his debt ceiling offer would give Democrats time to use their majorities on Capitol Hill to craft a bill to raise the borrowing limit on their own without Republican votes. The deadline to take action on the debt limit and avoid a U.S. credit default is Oct. 18. If Democrats accept McConnell\u2019s offer, lawmakers will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Biden to tout Covid vaccine mandates for large companies\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden on Thursday is set to visit Chicago to meet with United Airlines\u2019 CEO and local Democratic leaders as he touts his decision to impose Covid vaccine mandates on employees of large firms. Biden last month ordered all federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated, with few exceptions. For private employers with 100 or more workers, he proposed requiring employees to be vaccinated or tested weekly.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Vo59jFh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GJeD64S.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/jOXOlTL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/tJQWMi2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aubwMW2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/OzxnSxg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/HWJrQ2Q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/neRXcjH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zUrPe1n.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ObyqJeV.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TWyaNal.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/zVn77eO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4leusp2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vX61Ler.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/tEvAL0v.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-conagra-tilray-levi-twitter-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Conagra Brands (CAG)** \u2013 The company behind food brands like Healthy Choice, Hunt\u2019s and Hebrew National earned an adjusted 50 cents per share for its latest quarter, 1 cent above estimates, while revenue also came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts.
