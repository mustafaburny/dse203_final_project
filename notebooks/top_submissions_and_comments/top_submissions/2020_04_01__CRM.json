Fucked by Amazon. \n\nWalmart workers: Unwilling to form a union due because they don't want to get their fellow employees fired. Fucked by Walmart.\n\nHome Depot Cashier: Trying to get 25 cc signup every day so Home Depot can extract $25 in interest per month per cc sign up. Fucked by Home Depot.\n\nSalesforce programmer: Thinks he's doing good in live with his fat 250k salary. Doesn't realize his real value to salesforce is 25 million. Fucked by salesforce.\n\nEvery time I go over to /r/investing I see people saying \"better buy it now because it's going up, I believe in the American company.\"\n\nI've worked at a lot of companies. Some are better than others. Some treat their employees and customers right. They are the exception, and all will eventually turn into shitty companies, fucking over their employees for a buck. \n\nBut I can't blame companies, or the employers who run these companies. It's the system. It's designed to give the highest stock price to the shittiest companies that extract the most out of the employees and customers. Aka, the companies that figure out how to manipulate their employees the most. Amazon has reached god tier at that, now they are a \"tech company\" because they sell more \"books etc.\" than anybody. Best at fucking employees = Best valuation multiplier. \n\nIt's why America is turning into a shit hole. Need proof? Just look at the country with the most confirmed COVID-19 cases. \"But china wha wha wasn't telling the truth about their cccchina virus cases.\" Yeah... and we aren't under-counting im America too? America has reached peak fuck-up. Seriously, what has corporate America brought to the table in the last 30 years? The internet? Invented by the government. Facebook? It's just a fucking creepy web app. Google? Decent, but wtf is up with their we can now do evil shit. Apple? Okay, a little good stuff to come out of them, then Steve Jobs died and their biggest innovation is a cum drop in your ear. And now corporate America Execs is pissed that regular worker bees aren't excited to go die for their bottom line. \n\nAnyway, I've worked A LOT in corporate America. I've seen the shit they do and the way they operate. I can't bring myself to buy stock in corporate America (aside from a few companies temporarily).

        "selftext": "Hi Guys,\n\nAfter many fails in recent weeks with day trading trying to be smarter than the market and trying to time it - lesson learned. Speculation is not for me. Back to regular investing. \n\nI currently build a portfolio with:\n\nJNJ - for long term its a good stock overall. ER looking ok, involved in COVID cure, good future outlook. \n\nMicrosoft - leading software for work, gaining with systems for work from home. Azure Cloud looks like one of the market favorites. \n\nSAP (xetra) - its either Workday or SAP. I think SAP will continue its growth in Europe. Pandemic should help with moving to newer software for companies. Next week ER coming in. Good perspectives\n\nPHG - also before ER, the last contract for respirators looks good. One of the biggest medical devices providers currently. Huge on eu market. \n\nSalesforce - also a CRM like sap but different usage. Golden standard for many software solutions. Should also gain from companies moving online. Especiallh that it heavily supports working from home\n\nAll obove stocks are meant to be kept for a long time. All as per my analisys undervalued currently. Nothing is pandemic proof, but I see the above as stocks not going to be heavily affected with corrections or with a good perspective to rebound.\n\nI have two stocks I'm holding with the thought they might tumble so I have them as riskier assets. Ready to cut profits.\n\nNetflix - I think ER will be great for Q1. Might decline afterwards, but for now looks like a growth. Overpriced for sure. \n\nTesla - holding big hopes for their battery technology. Also the world wont stop moving to EV because of COVID. I think its overpriced, but with a good outlook for growth. Stop loss set though for cutting profits. \n\nOn my watch list to swap in case Netflix or Tesla will go down:\n\nBiogen / Inseego / Citrix / Pfizer / 3M\n\nAny recommendations?",

        "selftext": "Hey guys! Earnings season is up. I have tried a premium selling strategy that has worked for me pretty well for at least more than an year. The strategy is a simple put credit spread. And you do it on the companies that have a history of beating revenues, companies that have a strong management, etc. Sure, these companies can also take a dip if they miss their estimates but they tend to come back up after sometime. Examples for such companies might be FAANG+Microsoft. To protect my downside, I go out in the 45 DTE monthly, give up some premium collected and go far out to 2X the expected move. It gives me a little more room to the downside and enough time to recoup losses if the trade goes against me. \n\nI have made a list of such companies.

I am diving in trying to better organize this business model among publicly traded companies.

Those that offer horizontally integrated solutions, such as Salesforce or vertically integrated solutions such as Veeva Systems. \n\nBackground on SaaS subtypes: \n\nHorizontally-architected SaaS applications serve specific functions to enterprises across industries. They can include software for enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), compliance, HR, and cybersecurity.\n\nVertically architected applications, on the other hand, offer broader services that cater to specific industries. Companies in this space tend to be earlier on in their lifecycles and could consist of those that develop healthcare-oriented applications designed specifically for doctors, education platforms built for colleges and universities, or property management software that serves the housing industry.\n\nWhat are some of the companies that you feel will have the advantage for their respective product(s) or within their respective verticals?",

In 90 days the banks call them to collect the money or start foreclosure. This is one of the numerous machiavelic actions from he powers that be. As long as a lender is willing to defer payments, they don't have to mark the mortgages as being in default. Basically they are delaying the crash the most they can.
