The discussion comes from a user who sends me 2 links, respectively\n\n Black Rock Fund Advisor [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001006249](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001006249)\n\n Black Rock Inc [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001364742](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001364742)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI answered pragmatically indicating 2 links of response (I know I was wrong to paste only 2 links without explaining why but I thought that those who understood my post, would understand immediately)\n\nBlack Rock Fund Advisors [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=Gamestop&amp;ciks=0001006249&amp;entityName=BlackRock%2520Fund%2520Advisors%2520(CIK%25200001006249)](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=Gamestop&amp;ciks=0001006249&amp;entityName=BlackRock%2520Fund%2520Advisors%2520(CIK%25200001006249))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlack Rock Inc\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=Gamestop&amp;ciks=0001364742&amp;entityName=BlackRock%2520Inc.%2520(BLK)%2520(CIK%25200001364742)](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=Gamestop&amp;ciks=0001364742&amp;entityName=BlackRock%2520Inc.%2520(BLK)%2520(CIK%25200001364742))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell now let's read the comment that disputes my thread:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtzq228jw7t61.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4208ab78e36d1541bb5585b0b96311bd65aa001\n\n1 - \"You directly linked to a position of BR-FA ownership in GME, and now it is useless? Come on dude, do better\"\n\nThe reason I pasted the 2 links, as a response to the post was to show that there are no updated positions as of 3/31/2021 from Black Rock Fund Advisors. There are no updates since 2017!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2- \"That 13F-HR is the most recent holdings report. Can you show me where BR-FA sold?\"\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. You can see that just after that date of the most recent 13F-HR (Filed 2017-02-10), Black Rock Fund Advisors has not submitted any more 13F-HR forms to note their positions. You can check it out for yourself:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&amp;ciks=0001006249&amp;entityName=BlackRock%2520Fund%2520Advisors%2520(CIK%25200001006249)&amp;startdt=2016-02-01&amp;enddt=2020-02-01](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&amp;ciks=0001006249&amp;entityName=BlackRock%2520Fund%2520Advisors%2520(CIK%25200001006249)&amp;startdt=2016-02-01&amp;enddt=2020-02-01)\n\nIn lieu of submitting the 13F-HR, Black Rock Fund Advisor has begun submitting a 13F-NT form. What's different? Just open the Form to find out:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1006249/000108636417000052/xslForm13F\\_X01/primary\\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1006249/000108636417000052/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a0jc3tg8x7t61.png?width=1143&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3af16dbf8637a309375cdcf97fb906dcf68ed12d\n\nYou can tell right away what is written there:\n\n13F NOTICE. (Check here if no holdings reported are in this report, and all holdings are reported by other reporting manager(s).)\n\nand\n\nList of Other Managers Reporting for this Manager:\n\nIf there are no entries in this list, omit this section.\n\n\t\tForm 13F File Number Name\n\n\t028-12019 BlackRock Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook who is taking all the trouble to post the positions of their subsidiaries, but it is BLACK ROCK INC!!!!!!!\n\nWith this 13F- NT Black Rock Fund Advisor is basically saying: from today on, my daddy Black Rock Inc will take charge of everything I have! \n\nFrom here on Black Rock Fund Advisor presented only 13F-NT form (and bought only 4-5 stocks to date). \n\nBut let's see what was happening to Black Rock Inc in the meantime....\n\nThese are the positions of BlackRock Inc on 2017-02-10 taken from 13F-HR:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/va928flhx7t61.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f353b179d95bb30af976defb7fd2ab53f9bc0b15\n\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001364742/000108636417000005/xslForm13F\\_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001364742/000108636417000005/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml)\n\nWhat do you notice? Black Rock Inc had very few GME shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut let's analyze the next 13F-HR submitted by Black Rock Inc on 2017-05-12:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8wprt8kx7t61.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9582010b2ef6a34535c4180c3019a183a3257b01\n\nSoruce: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F\\_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml)\n\nBut it's magic!!!! Black Rock Inc owns as many as 14 positions!!! But how is that possible!!!! Oh my god!!! Burn the witch!!!!\n\n \n\nBut let's analyze the front page of this Form 13F-HR from 2017-05-12:\n\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F\\_X01/primary\\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tyv74c1y7t61.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0301098b781f539ee346bc173cb559751890b15\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's analyze the most important passages:\n\n13F COMBINATION REPORT. (Check here if a portion of the holdings for this reporting manager are reported in this report and a portion are reported by other reporting manager(s).)\n\nand\n\nProvide a numbered list of the name(s) and Form 13F file number(s) of all institutional investment managers with respect to which this report is filed, other than the manager filing this report.\n\nIf there are no entries in this list, state \"NONE\" and omit the column headings and list entries.\n\n[Look who is on the list, but it is indeed BLACK ROCK FUND ADVISOR!!!](https://preview.redd.it/4a8h3z6nx7t61.png?width=1408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c29fb4eb43a2117bd7732eed42c953b2f764285)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that I have shown you how from 2017-05-12 onwards Black Rock Inc has taken over the position of all their subsidiaries. The evolutions of those GME positions over time you can check for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's come to the other point made by the user \n\n\"Also, in your Fidelity sale filing, pay attention to section 7. They moved the securities to another company.\n\n\"Item 7. Identification and Classification of the Subsidiary Which Acquired the Security Being Reported on By the Parent Holding Company.\n\nSee attached Exhibit A.\"\n\nHere he is referring to an old post that came out at the time of the Fidelity GME sale posted on the GME forum. I have already replied to this kind of comment and I paste one of my answers:\n\nI've already been shown the thread you mean ( you can find it in the comments on my post on s u p e r s t o n k ). The author of the post is simply wrong because:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 - There is no reference whatsoever to a transfer of shares\n\n2- But let's say for sure that the author is right, where is the new SEC filing? Why on bloomberg terminal has disappeared fidelity from January 29 onwards?\n\n3- If there had been a real transfer there would be SEC filings with different C    I      K's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to add that after reading what I have written here, it should be clearer why Fidelity has SOLD and not moved shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to conclude by saying that after posting my GME counter DD, I received many positive comments that understood what I was talking about but also many others that did not understand. It's okay to not understand some things, I didn't understand them when I started either. But I get annoyed by those who try to counter what I have written with really meaningless arguments that only show that they have not understood anything about the subject and have little knowledge on the subject. This is why I sometimes respond badly.",

        "selftext": "WWE (yes, that WWE) is a company that has been on my watch list since 2018 when I heard the CEO on CNBC.  The stock hit $96 shortly after, currently at $57.  What intrigued me at the time was that it was the number 2 most watched YouTube channel in the world due to the popularity of fake wrestling in India.\n\nI started building a position not too long ago because of three letters: NFT.\n\n* This is a huge hidden asset for the company that hasn't been reflected in the share price yet.  If they can capitalize on this, the stock will go through the roof.  Name a more epic video library than the one owned by Vincent Kennedy McMahon...\n* Do you know how much pervs would pay NFTs of Sable, Trish Stratus, and Stacey Keibler?\n\nOther Factors:\n\n* 24% short float..\n* They announce earnings after hours tomorrow, which I think will be a beat\n* WWE was deemed an \"essential\" business in Florida last year and was allowed to continue operating.  I'm sure Vince pulled some strings to make it happen.  WWE was still running, while other majors sports were not.  Due to the fact they were still running, they were still paid from their TV deal - which accounts for a large portion of their revenue (GENIUS).  Moral of the story: Vince doesn't lose.\n* Only $719.96M debt with $593.M cash - Market Cap $4.35B, so decent financial shape.  Forward P/E is reasonable, even pays a small Dividend.  This makes it eligible for dividends funds and etfs.\n* WWE is very cost conscious (no problem cutting roster)\n* BlackRock owns 9.36% of the company (do you know how good of a pitch the PM had to make for BR to invest in WWE?)\n* Solid reopening play\n* MEMES\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a professional investors, please don't listen to me - I am high as a kite right now.  BUT, I have found some under the radar companies (see post history) that have hit it out of the park.",
