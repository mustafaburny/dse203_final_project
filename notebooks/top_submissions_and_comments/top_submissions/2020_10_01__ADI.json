TheStreet score\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):\n\n*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n# 2. Zacks Rank\n\nIt is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):\n\n*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy*\n\n*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500's +10.6% .*\n\n# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation\n\nWe're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):\n\n*\"A\" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company\u2019s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a \"****Strong Buy****\".*\n\n*\"B\" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company\u2019s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered the equivalent of a \"****Buy****\".*\n\n# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price\n\nIt is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price\n\nSimilar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.\n\n# 6. Piotroski F-Score\n\nThe Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski\u2019s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).\n\n# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk\n\nMoody\u2019s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company\u2019s liabilities.\n\nThe value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)\n\n# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.\n\nMore detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):\n\n*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*\n\n*A low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish case for it.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the reading.

        "selftext": "1) What is Synaptics?\n\nFor almost 35 years, Synaptics has been focused on how people interact with devices. The company has created technology for touchscreens, touchpads, and fingerprint readers, and in recent years has focused on displays and touchscreens used in mobile phones. Synaptics makes parts used in Apple (AAPL) iPhones, Google Home speakers, and automotive touchscreens, among other applications.\n\nSynaptics\u2019 fortunes flagged in recent years, hurt by a drifting corporate mission and growing competition from Asia. Revenue in the June 2020 fiscal year was $1.33 billion, about 10% below the year-earlier level, marking the third straight year of declining revenue. Non-GAAP net income was $5.95 a share, up from $4 in fiscal 2019, reversing four consecutive years of declining profits.\n\n\n2) Who is Michael Hurlston?\n\nThis savior became SYNA\u2019s CEO about a year ago. When Michael Hurlston became CEO of Synaptics a year ago, the chip seller was a \u201cbag of parts,\u201d he says. \u201cJob No. 1 was to make the most out of each part of the portfolio.\u201d\n\nHurlston, 53, has done that, and more, chopping costs, shedding weak operations, making smart acquisitions, and burnishing the financial outlook of the San Jose, Calif.\u2013based company, which makes components used in human-machine interface applications. So far, investors like what they see: Synaptics\u2019 stock (ticker: SYNA) has rallied almost 150% in the past 12 months, reversing the prior four years\u2019 losses. More gains could lie ahead, as Hurlston and his team continue to restructure and grow the business.\n\nHurlston seems a good choice to move things forward. Most recently he was CEO of Finisar, an optical-networking component company that he sold to II-VI (pronounced \u201ctwo six\u201d) for $3.2 billion within a year of his arrival. Before that, he was senior vice president for mobile, wireless, and connectivity products at Broadcom. More on that in a moment.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived here, the company was undermanaged,\u201d Hurlston said in a Zoom interview from his office. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t a lot of rigor around anything we did\u2014no regular engineering reviews, or budget reviews, or general tracking of progress.\u201d\n\nHurlston restructured the product portfolio, selling a business that makes integrated touch and display chips for LCD phones to a Chinese private-equity firm. Most high-end phones now use OLED displays, with LCDs used primarily in lower-end devices, he noted. Competition was fierce, and margins were ebbing.\n\nTwo acquisitions then followed, both closing in July. Synaptics bought DisplayLink, a Palo Alto\u2013based company with a lock on the market for components used in universal docking stations, for $305 million in cash. \u201cThey\u2019re the only company that has been able to figure this out,\u201d Hurlston said.\n\nThe transaction was immediately accretive to earnings.\n\nSynaptics also spent $250 million for Broadcom\u2019s wireless Internet of Things business, which includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS technologies. Hurlston knew that business intimately: He used to run it. \u201cWe felt like there were a lot of places where we needed wireless assets,\u201d he said, citing video and audio products and wireless docking stations. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal that only we could have done. My old team was involved, and some of them came over here.\u201d\n\nHe sees applications in wearables, surveillance cameras, and video set-top boxes.\n\n\n3) Valuation?\n\nAt a recent $78~/share, Synaptics trades for just over two times estimated revenue and less than 13 times expected profit for the June-2021 fiscal year. Competitors, such as Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), and Microchip Technology (MC HP ), fetch five to 10 times current-year revenue, suggesting Synaptics is underappreciated in every sense of the word.\n\nFurthermore, when SYNA beat their numbers in the last earnings call (and raised Q1 guidance), the stock jumped significantly and briefly touched 52 week high ($90~/share) before the stock retreated along with the market over the last 3 months. Fundamentally, nothing has changed about this company\u2019s future prospects.

The result: Quarterly operating expenses fell to about $80 million from $110 million, and head count dropped to 1,200 from 1,700.\n\nMeanwhile, Synaptics\u2019 gross profit margins have risen in the past year to nearly 50% from under 40%. The company is configured, he says, to grow revenue in the 4% to 6% range, with profits rising faster as margins expand. Analysts expect Synaptics to earn $6.49 a share this year on revenue of $1.3 billion. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh thinks that earnings could top $8 a share in fiscal 2022.

        "selftext": "Synaptics is scheduled to report on November 5th (Thursday). It is an undervalued stock, currently around $78/share. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1) What is Synaptics?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor almost 35 years, Synaptics has been focused on how people interact with devices. The company has created technology for touchscreens, touchpads, and fingerprint readers, and in recent years has focused on displays and touchscreens used in mobile phones. Synaptics makes parts used in Apple (AAPL) iPhones, Google Home speakers, and automotive touchscreens, among other applications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSynaptics\u2019 fortunes flagged in recent years, hurt by a drifting corporate mission and growing competition from Asia. Revenue in the June 2020 fiscal year was $1.33 billion, about 10% below the year-earlier level, marking the third straight year of declining revenue. Non-GAAP net income was $5.95 a share, up from $4 in fiscal 2019, reversing four consecutive years of declining profits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2) Who is Michael Hurlston?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis savior became SYNA\u2019s CEO about a year ago. When Michael Hurlston became CEO of Synaptics a year ago, the chip seller was a \u201cbag of parts,\u201d he says. \u201cJob No. 1 was to make the most out of each part of the portfolio.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHurlston, 53, has done that, and more, chopping costs, shedding weak operations, making smart acquisitions, and burnishing the financial outlook of the San Jose, Calif.\u2013based company, which makes components used in human-machine interface applications. So far, investors like what they see: Synaptics\u2019 stock has rallied almost 150% in the past 12 months, reversing the prior four years\u2019 losses. More gains could lie ahead, as Hurlston and his team continue to restructure and grow the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHurlston seems a good choice to move things forward. Most recently he was CEO of Finisar, an optical-networking component company that he sold to II-VI for $3.2 billion within a year of his arrival. Before that, he was senior vice president for mobile, wireless, and connectivity products at Broadcom. More on that in a moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived here, the company was undermanaged,\u201d Hurlston said in a Zoom interview from his office. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t a lot of rigor around anything we did\u2014no regular engineering reviews, or budget reviews, or general tracking of progress.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHurlston restructured the product portfolio, selling a business that makes integrated touch and display chips for LCD phones to a Chinese private-equity firm. Most high-end phones now use OLED displays, with LCDs used primarily in lower-end devices, he noted. Competition was fierce, and margins were ebbing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo acquisitions then followed, both closing in July. Synaptics bought DisplayLink, a Palo Alto\u2013based company with a lock on the market for components used in universal docking stations, for $305 million in cash. \u201cThey\u2019re the only company that has been able to figure this out,\u201d Hurlston said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe transaction was immediately accretive to earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSynaptics also spent $250 million for Broadcom\u2019s wireless Internet of Things business, which includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS technologies. Hurlston knew that business intimately: He used to run it. \u201cWe felt like there were a lot of places where we needed wireless assets,\u201d he said, citing video and audio products and wireless docking stations. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal that only we could have done. My old team was involved, and some of them came over here.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe sees applications in wearables, surveillance cameras, and video set-top boxes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3) Valuation?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt a recent $78\\~/share, Synaptics trades for just over two times estimated revenue and less than 13 times expected profit for the June-2021 fiscal year. Competitors, such as Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), and Microchip Technology (MC HP ), fetch five to 10 times current-year revenue, suggesting Synaptics is underappreciated in every sense of the word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, when SYNA beat their numbers in the last earnings call (and raised Q1 guidance), the stock jumped significantly and briefly touched 52 week high ($90\\~/share) before the stock retreated along with the market over the last 3 months. Fundamentally, nothing has changed about this company\u2019s future prospects. They purchased IoT portfolio from Broadcom (AVGO) and they are focusing on high margin segments and once again, this stock is ripe for another beat when they report on Nov 5th. It is not out of the question that the stock will continue to march over the next 12 months and if you missed out on AMD/NVDA and other semiconductor play, this is the stock that you have been looking for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, per Michael Hurlston who has a track record of turning around companies like Finisar, Synaptics had become a \u201c$1 billion revenue company in the body of a $2 billion revenue company,\u201d with an inefficient structure. For example, its PC business had a core design center in Taiwan\u2019s capital city of Taipei, and offices in Armenia; Hyderabad, India; and the U.S. He closed all but the Taipei office, located near PC design operations for customers HP Inc. and Dell. \u201cI did that kind of thing across the business,\u201d he said. The result: Quarterly operating expenses fell to about $80 million from $110 million, and head count dropped to 1,200 from 1,700.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, Synaptics\u2019 gross profit margins have risen in the past year to nearly 50% from under 40%.

TheStreet score\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):\n\n*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n# 2. Zacks Rank\n\nIt is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):\n\n*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy*\n\n*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500's +10.6% .*\n\n# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation\n\nWe're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):\n\n*\"A\" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company\u2019s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a \"****Strong Buy****\".*\n\n*\"B\" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company\u2019s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered the equivalent of a \"****Buy****\".*\n\n# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price\n\nIt is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price\n\nSimilar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.\n\n# 6. Piotroski F-Score\n\nThe Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski\u2019s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).\n\n# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk\n\nMoody\u2019s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company\u2019s liabilities.\n\nThe value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)\n\n# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.\n\nMore detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):\n\n*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*\n\n*A low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish case for it.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the reading.
