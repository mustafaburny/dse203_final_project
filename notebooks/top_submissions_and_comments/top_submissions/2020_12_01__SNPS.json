        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

        "selftext": "I've been dollar cost averaging in M1 Finance since October 28, 2019. I contributed $2000 for tax year 2019 and $6000 (max) for tax year 2020. I have current positions in the following: \n\nTTD, TSLA, FVRR, CRWD, PYPL, NFLX, SNPS, PINS, HUBS, TWLO \n\nMy last change, I took a little off the top with TWLO as I thought it was going to tank...it did not and it kept going. I wanted to spread some love to PYPL, NFLX, SNPS and PINS. I should have let it run, but oh wellz. \n\nWhat I'd like to do is hopefully have 40% annualized return so I can get $1,000,000 in a 10 year timeline. I'm not interested in going index funds (I will advise folks who are in their 20s to do that.) \n\nI am think of liquidating everything to keep my double-up and go into the following M1 pies: \n\n**Financial Pie** 25%\n\n**Consumer Cyclical Pie** 25%\n\n**Communication Services Pie** 25%\n\n**Technology Pie** 25%\n\n**\\*** **Financial Pie** \n\nLMND 50%\n\nPYPL 50%\n\n\\* **Consumer Cyclical Pie**\n\nAMZN 50%\n\nTSLA 50%\n\n\\* **Communication Services Pie**\n\nDIS 20%\n\nFVRR 20%\n\nPINS 20%\n\nTWLO 20%\n\nZM 20%\n\n\\* **Technology Pie**\n\nCRWD 17%\n\nHUBS 17%\n\nSHOP 17%\n\nTTD 17%\n\nADSK 16%\n\nOKTA 16%\n\n\\--------\n\nShould I start from scratch with the above? If I can get 40% or more of annualized returns with what I've done I'd be very happy. Once I get a million, I will then turn into a dividend investor and live off yields for the rest of my life. That's my goal anyway. I welcome any advice or being pointed in the right direction.",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

        "selftext": "# The Metric\n\nI recently had an idea for a metric to be used to find hot stocks. I call the metric \"Price Elasticity\" and it is comprised of two numbers: upturn elasticity and downturn elasticity.\n\n* Upturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market up days\n* Downturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market down days\n\nUsing these numbers and a few additional basic requirements (like positive EPS and at least 31 days of trading history), my screener found 99 stocks out of about 5700 searched that have good to exceptional price elasticities. (the list of these stocks is linked below and also [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing))\n\n# What makes for good price elasticity numbers?\n\nI made two classifications for stocks with good price elasticity data.\n\n1. **Irrational** \\- Upturn elasticity &gt; 1, Downturn elasticity &lt; 0\n2. **Responsible** \\- Upturn elasticity &gt; 1, 0 &lt; Downturn elasticity &lt; 1\n\nWith any stock I want an upturn elasticity &gt; 1, meaning that the stock tends to move higher than the market when the market goes up. The \"Irrational\" classification gets its name because if a stock's downturn elasticity is negative this means the stock, on average, moves up when the market goes down. So a stock that moves higher than the market when the market goes up and also moves up when the market goes down is classified as \"Irrational\". These stocks tend to have less trading history and are very volatile.\n\nThen there are \"Responsible\" stocks which like Irrational stocks move higher than the market when the market goes up. Unlike Irrational stocks though, Responsible stocks move lower when the market moves lower. The reason I still consider them good is because their downturn elasticity is &lt;1 and &gt;0, meaning that, while they do move down with the market, they move down to a lesser degree.\n\nSome popular stocks picked up by the screener include: AMD, ADSK, ETSY, NFLX, NVDA, SHOP and TSLA. Many of the other stocks have lower market caps and could be interesting value / growth plays given they too made the cut.\n\n# Link to the 99 stocks found:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea if there is merit to my Price Elasticity metric (or if it has already been \"invented\") but it was a fun project and the screener found some interesting stocks I would have never discovered otherwise. The validity of the metric is entirely based on the assumption that past trends indicate future performance, and for those looking to beat the market the trends of these 99 stocks should be very appealing. I made the screener using Python3 and TD Ameritrade's API. Of the stocks in that list I am currently holding AMD, CAMT, EPAM, and NLOK.",

        "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI have been lurking on here for quite some time now and, going into 2021, I figured I'd start a thread to ask some of my questions for 2021. Maybe I will see them answered, or read suggestions / find inspiration.\n\nI started investing about three months ago and am currently invested in Vanguard All World, SAP (buying after the dip has worked out well), ICLN, Nvidia, AMD. I intend to hold all of them long-term with a hopeful profit of over 5%. Nvidia has a bit more room to grow, I hope, given their sales numbers, different tech and ARM acqusition, and I am also hoping for incredible sales numbers of AMD. \n\n I also hold GME because I am an absolute sheep idiot who bought into the hype high; I will probably sell low but am waiting for Jan 11. In the next few days, I want to buy a bit of Microsoft for 2021. Overall, I am looking for a relatively \"safe\" return of at least 5 - 10%, ideally a bit more of course. All my stock choices, however, are very tech-oriented. That is because it's the field in which I know most about the companies and their numbers, and also because they've been running well.\n\nHowever, I am very new and none of this of course means that these companies will run well in 2021. If we start seeing a return to normalcy in mid 2021, what are stocks that really benefit from that return to \"normalcy\"? I figured Salesforce could be an option because of its dip and them also probably benefiting from overall economic upturn, just like SAP. But that, again, would be tech. I read JPM and on this subreddit a lot, what would be the reasoning here? People are also mentioning Disney: is that because of Disney+ or because of reopening theme parks? \n\nSo, as you can see, I am open for suggestions. It'd be cool if you could help me out a bit! Thank you in advance. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot invest in ARK ETFs, as none of my three European brokers offer these funds, and I am not willing to open a fourth broker account.",

        "selftext": "I'll start. My biggest winners were AMZN +61% ,  TTWO +57% , AMD +56% , TSM +51% , and NVDA +43%.\n\nBiggest lovers were RKT -22% and BABA -13%. BABA hurt the worst. I had very high hopes for that stock. I played a few meme stocks towards the end of the year. Had mixed results. Otherwise all bluechips and etfs.\n\nOverall portfolios up 30% so I had a great year. My goal is to maintain a modest 12% growth next year. Anyone want to share their winners and lovers feel free",
