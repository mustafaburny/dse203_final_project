        "selftext": "Just some ramblings from a 59 year old investor. Been through this in 87 and 2008 and it's the same every time. The world as we know it is ending, the rules for investing have changed, the paradigm has shifted, etc.... and we're all F'd. Yesterday the volume was huge and everything was getting kicked to the curb, in all categories, even gold and crypto. That's the definition of panic. Throwing out the babies with the bathwater. I was sitting on cash but putting it to work now. Started buying in at -15% and have been cost average buying every 5% pts down. I'm about 2/3's done. Bought heavily at the close yesterday and wanted to puke the whole time and my inner dialogue was telling me what a moron I am. Yesterday had all the symptoms of capitulation when we were down 27% peak to trough, but I think we'll end up down 30-35% all totaled before this is over, so there will be plenty of buy opportunities over the next few weeks. From there we may bounce around in a short lived bear market that traders will like. Not quite the existential financial crisis of 2008 but close. Loading up on MSFT, DIS, CSCO, AAPL, BAC, CVS, SBUX, MA, VZ, T, MU, STX, NKE etc... and plan to hold for 10+ year timeline. When this is over, interest rates will be at zero and people have to put their money somewhere for any kind of yield. If you got caught in this downdraft and you're at the point now where the pain is kicking your ass and you're tempted to sell... I gave in and did that in 2008 and when I reverse engineer if I had just done nothing and just shut my computer, I would have doubled my money in the following 5-7 years. Remember, nearly everyone you see commenting on CNBC and every article you read from the so called experts, all have a position to protect and every word they speak is in service of protecting that position/gameplan.",
