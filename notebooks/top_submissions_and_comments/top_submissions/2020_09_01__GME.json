        "selftext": "**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\n* When I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn\u2019t take very long to see [comments]( https://i.imgur.com/lndA70O.png) [like](https://i.imgur.com/Ec4z1fx.png) [these](https://i.imgur.com/6WoeXUS.png), yet here we [are](https://i.imgur.com/NpANVzR.png). What\u2019s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wsb thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week. \n* Its no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software \u2013 under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.\n\n**II. CONSOLES**\n\n* Just to start things off, you have to remember we\u2019re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop\u2019s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically [spiked](https://i.imgur.com/LOehh3E.png).\n\n**III. POST CONSOLE CYCLE**\n\n* At this point, the focus turns to what happens once the hype dies down. Digital will continue to erode upon physical, but the key factor here is that physical is not actually dying off. [Its not](https://i.imgur.com/kmVPF39.png) [going to](https://i.imgur.com/rfRRGC9.png) zero. **The biggest reason physical is sequentially a lower percentage of the market is because the total market size is increasing.** Digital is shooting off while physical is largely stagnant. Note that physical games admittedly have their strengths. Not only are they structurally cheaper because you can resell them, they also have clear definitions of ownership and the collectability factor where you *need* to have a physical copy you can hold. In fact, [two thirds](https://www.limelight.com/resources/white-paper/state-of-online-gaming-2019/) of console video game players prefer physical vs digital.\n* While physical is here to stay, albeit at a weaker level, that isn\u2019t enough to turn the tides for GameStop. You see, GameStop knows digital is the trend and here to stay, they are not fighting it, **they are moving along the secular shift**. GameStop sells [digital games](https://i.imgur.com/RZJGjFE.png). GameStop is set to release a mobile app combining Game Informer and a online storefront by [month end](https://i.imgur.com/rdXejYc.png). They are doubling down on their online store with +500% ecommerce growth in [Q1]( http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results) and +800% growth in [Q2](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-second-quarter-results-and-strong-progress). Expanding into numerous other [categories](https://i.imgur.com/QSkZEAw.png). Nearly 70% of their online orders were fulfilled on the same [day](https://i.imgur.com/NK8lkqD.png) leveraging their wide network of stores, of which they are pruning the excess. Also, Game prices are set to [increase $10](https://technosports.co.in/2020/09/19/sony-confirms-that-ps5-games-will-cost-up-to-69-99/). \n* GameStop\u2019s Loyalty Program accounts for over 55M [users](http://news.gamestop.com/fact-sheet-0). They intend on leveraging this network though a [company branded credit card](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-now-taking-pre-orders-sony-playstationr5-and-sony) with spending rewards to grab market share and retain customers. Furthermore, a digital revenue sharing model continues to [grow](https://i.imgur.com/V94FWJC.png) as publishers understand the value of GameStop as a customer acquisition service and that keeping the company afloat is better for sales and the general video game industry. (*[See the fall of Toys R us and its impact on Mattel/Hasbro](https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-toy-category-still-hasnt-recovered-from-the-death-of-toys-r-us/571701/); turns out the manufacturers really needed ToysRUs*)\n\n**VI. BALANCE SHEET**\n\n* But wait, their financials must be shit right? They have to be losing money. How much longer can they last? \n* Well it turns out their books are rock solid. They offered their creditors a new set of terms to push back debt for 2 years, 50% of them [took it](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer). They have eliminated all excess goodwill impairments. They are in a [$300M net cash position](https://i.imgur.com/HhfHaIT.png) with significantly reduced inventory (which explains the sharp reduction in Q1/2 sales) and massively cut SG&amp;A by 28% in preparation for the console cycle. [FCF KING](https://i.imgur.com/LYyrrUm.png)\n* Many believe the days of their strong margins are long gone, but in fact its only beginning. You have to remember, digital is only outpacing NEW physical games. [Retro games](https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2019/02/01/retro-consoles-video-game-sales-nostalgia/) are a [huge untapped market](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/talking_point_how_much_is_your_video_game_collection_really_worth_to_you) where GameStop can replicate their past success, and it is a category digital can never penetrate. [Jesus wtf.](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nes/little-samson) GameStop is looking into [these already](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/retro-gaming/pre-owned)\n\n**V. MAJOR BACKING**\n\n* In fact, their ecommerce prospects are so promising, Ryan Cohen bought a [10% stake](https://investorplace.com/2020/08/gamestop-news-sends-gme-stock-soaring/). This guy took on Amazon and [won](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#7cdf60865579). [Jefferies](https://i.imgur.com/Duyxu1i.png) and [Talsey](https://i.imgur.com/K169L1N.png), wall street firms, came out with strong buy ratings citing company prospects. [Michael Burry](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/michael-burry-top-portfolio-holdings-massive-bet-alphabet-google-scion-2020-8-1029517864#) still holds a 5% stake. This guy took on Wall Street and won. [Half their creditors](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer) ($200M worth) believe in GameStop\u2019s prospects. Why would they defer their debt unless they believed the company will be in a paying position by 2023?\n\n**VI. THE SHORTS**\n\n* But here is the real kicker. GameStop\u2019s short float. 120% has never been seen before. The short theory was that GameStop would not make it to the new console cycle and the shorters would collect their tendies. But GameStop made it. Current short fees are like 60% and from some figures we can draw on, we estimate that around 70% of the shorts got in [under $7](https://i.imgur.com/wRaMbLx.png), GameStop is currently nearing $10. **70% of the shorts are underwater.** Even if you don\u2019t believe that any of their initiatives will work you have to admit that the company will be able to continue operating for another two years off the new console hype alone. When the stock hits roughly $15, we can expect to see several margin calls trigger a fucking massive short squeeze. For reference, [Blue Apron](https://i.imgur.com/6EqU417.png), [Volkswagen](https://i.imgur.com/S3DHn3j.gif).\n\n**VII. CONCLUSION**\n\n* Just the fact GME got to the new console cycle must be making the shorts cry. Add on that they\u2019ve been making serious progress towards online and mobile presence, aligning themselves with industry trends, operating in a growing market, potential monopoly in the untapped retro market, solid financials, beginning their new upward cyclic cycle; you have the makings of a powerful ecommerce storefront just leaning into their growth period. Even post console hype, they should be able to leverage their branded credit card to retain a huge number of customers and bite off huge market share off other retailers. Lastly, remember that despite the trend towards digital, its in the gaming industry's best interest to keep GameStop going strong. The likelihood of additional revenue sharing agreements are fairly high.\n* For comparison GameStop has a P/S ratio 0.11. Chewy has a P/S ratio of 3.6. If GME begins to grow their revenue from this point its valuation will begin to normalize. Even a P/S of 0.2 would mean a stock price of ~$16, 0.4 would mean $32. The company is going to ride the console hype and likely trigger more than a few margin calls along the way. Everything management has been doing is to ride the new cycle into a fluid ecommerce business model, and everything I'm seeing suggests its going to work. \n\n[Tl;dr](https://i.redd.it/bxn2mf4bzoj41.jpg)\n\n10c 9/25 to play XBOX prerelease\n\n10c 10/2 to play Mobile App/Stimulus \n\n10c 11/20 to play Console Release Date\n\n10c 4/16 to play Holiday Earnings/short squeeze\n\n***most text references are from GameStop's Q2 transcript which you can find [here.](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/09/10/gamestop-gme-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)",

Sherman has been selling non-performing assets and have reduced the liabilities by 10% as well, trying to weather the virus event as much as possible for a brick and mortar business. He has reduced their net loss from 816 million a year to 554 a year.

The current fee for borrowing GME stock to short is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Absurdly high fees](https://preview.redd.it/iisl2vvuibp51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b864e5e7ab39b88b3cd825817ae15729c374a802)\n\n  \n\nOn 9/22/2020 GME appeared on the **SEC Threshold list.** What is this and why is it important?\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp)\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nA threshold list is a list of securities **that failed to settle** in the previous five trading days.\n\nThey are published by various exchanges in accordance with SEC regulations.\n\nThese settlement failures may be **indicative of naked short selling**, although they may also be caused by benign factors, such as administrative errors.\n\nWhat is naked short selling? \n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp)\n\nIllegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. Despite being made illegal after 2008 financial crisis naked shorting continues due to certain loopholes. \n\nOn 9/24/2020 the **Uptick Rule was triggered and comes into effect for GME on 9/25/2020.** \n\n**Understanding the Uptick Rule**\n\nThe Uptick Rule prevents sellers from accelerating the downward momentum of a securities price already in sharp decline. By entering a short-sale order with a price above the current bid, a short seller ensures that an order is filled on an uptick. The uptick rule prevents MM and short sellers from essentially doing this. \n\n  \n\n**Potential Catalysts:**\n\nShare buybacks\n\n[The last time they bought shares back was in October 2019 and it resulted in a 30&amp;#37; spike in a month.](https://preview.redd.it/exdgc2pajbp51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e2022f97a1e2b3121bdf433fc81c2026a8e1a7c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OCT 2019 Spike](https://preview.redd.it/42sschyfjbp51.png?width=197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6588395574b74d52de511932d9bd964600a5330b)\n\n  \n\n**Ryan Cohen:**\n\nMr. Cohen had previously been CEO of Chewy, which he took from the ground up to the largest online retailer for pet goods. He knows how to get a company profitable and then sell it at a huge profit.\n\nHe's had absolutely nothing to do for 2 years and his other 2 biggest investments before disclosing his shares in GME are in Apple and Wells Fargo, both of which are too big for him to buy outright, but GME only has a marketcap of 654 or so million, so he's in luck. He can buy the whole thing and take it private if he wants to. My personal opinion is that he wants to become CEO. \n\n**Michael Burry:**\n\nMr. Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, could decide to buy shares to force the squeeze and then his options and share are worth hundreds of millions. He has enough capital to do this by himself if he wanted. \n\n[https://cheaperthanguru.com/portfolio/michael-burry?order=value](https://cheaperthanguru.com/portfolio/michael-burry?order=value)\n\nBurry's Portfolio is here.

Wait for the short squeeze to happen soon, 50$ is highly probable. \n\nFor those of you retards who don't know what short squeeze means: normally if you want to short a stock you borrow it (for a fee) and sell to buy back at lower price and make bank. But what happens if the price goes up against you? You not only have to pay the borrow fee as time passes, you also can get margin called and have to buy back the shares at higher prices. Which drives price higher. Which makes more shorters be margin called and buy back shared. Rinse and repeat and watch the price fly to the fucking moon\n\nI believe this is the last change to hop in on the dip. GME is down today to sub-10 levels, but is rising back again as I write it so anyone who wants a golden ticket to the fucking moon - come on in.\n\nPositions: GME 12c / sell 10p",

        "selftext": "I have been long GME in one position or another for quite a while and I see a lot of people trying to figure out if the rally is over. I am still in most of my positions and I am a believer that this thing still has quite a ways to pop to the upside. This is less of DD about GME's rise so far and more focused on the prospect of further short squeezing \n\nTwice a month short floats are reported (the 1st and 15th of the month) and are published a few days later. Yesterday the GME short interest from the September 15th report was released and the numbers are very encouraging that there is much short squeeze left to be had.\n\n[The Short float percentage was 136&amp;#37; on Sept 15th, this means for every one real share there are 1.3 \\\\\"paper shares\\\\\" that are sold short, this is a crazy short float!](https://preview.redd.it/2uz4qehdhcp51.png?width=417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a16f7c3f10ae90a1de26d0ae65ac656dda62540a)\n\nIt's important to remember that this is data that is 10 days old and the closing price on the 15th was $7.09 compared to currently trading around $9.75. The Bears would argue that this \\~37% move to the upside was the entire short squeeze, but while there may have been some short covering along that move from $7 to $9, I believe that this thing is still stretched on the short side and there is still substantial upside opportunity.\n\n[Short float is continuing to rise regardless of price action](https://preview.redd.it/x36bzuclhcp51.png?width=1370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d21faacffe8cee2ae0114d6b535996bc2cc78f6)\n\nHigh short interest is not a new concept for GME, but it is important to look at the behavior of the bears relative to the price action leading up to this price move. Looking back at the short float from the end of July we can attempt to gain some insight into the mentality of the short sellers. In the first half of August as the price shot up more than 65% the overall short float rose by 2.2%, then again in the back half of August the short float rose by an additional 3.9% despite a 26% decline in price.\n\nThis means that the bears appear to be operating under the assumption that GME is going to crash below $4 and ultimately go to 0. They see a rising price as an opportunity to short it at a higher price and they are not taking gains off the table when the stock pulls back as it did in the back half of August. This means that there is still a lot of overconfidence and greed on the short side of the GME trade, both things that point to a potentially massive short squeeze.\n\nNow let look at that latest short float update from the 15th of September that was just released yesterday. In first half of September the share price rose by 17%, and the short float sky rocketed an additional 15%! This means that as the stock rose above $7 a share the short float rose to an astounding 136%! For those that don't know, this means that every single share of GameStop stock has been borrowed to be sold short and a third of them have been borrowed to be short a second time this is the exact conditions we want to see for a good long and hard short squeeze!\n\n[SLB Rate represents the annual interest that Bears are paying to borrow shares](https://preview.redd.it/t5d6g0sqhcp51.png?width=1657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f7dc15308e3da6532f5ffcfbd48c97b2dbb2f44)\n\nLooking at the stock borrowing prices as a proxy for short volume over the last 10 days, we can see that while the borrowing rates did drop between the 17th and the 23rd they have stabilized and are rising again. This means that while there was some short covering that pushed the stock temporarily up to $11, I believe that there is still a massive short interest open in GME and as the console sales + holiday season roll on there is much potential for positive surprises that will trigger a violent move to the upside that will lead to the real forced buying that comes with a true short squeeze.\n\nPositions:\n\n\\+3k shares\n\nApr 21 10c\n\nJan 22 12C\n\ntldr: Bears are exhibiting greedy behavior and there is a huge potential for WAY more of a short squeeze still",

        "selftext": "Hello, retards! Today we're going to learn about short squeezes. Shorts are gay bears who borrow stock to sell it, under the mistaken impression that stocks can go down. There are two ways that short sellers lose money. The first is the simple and obvious one. If the stock goes up, the retard who shorted it might have to buy it back at a higher price than he sold it, incurring a loss. The second way is the borrow rate. Obviously brokers and banks only let people like us trade so they can steal our money. One way they steal our money is by having the audacity to charge interest on borrowed shares.\n\nNow, the key here is that as more shares are shorted and it's harder to borrow new shares to sell short, the *borrow rate rises*. It can rise very, very quickly. Since we're all poor and have no access to real data, we'll use iborrowdesk.com to get a sense of the borrow rates. While the rate on iborrow might not be accurate for all market participants and brokers, it should go up and down with the average borrow rate across the market.\n\nGamestop is showing as a 39% borrow rate, with 15,000 shares available to short.\n\nVirgin Galactic is showing at a 3% borrow rate, with hundreds of thousands of shares available to short.\n\nWhat this tells us is that the gay bears are paying very little money to short Virgin Virgin, but are paying out the fucking nose to short Chad Gamestop. As the share price of both stocks rise, the short sellers of Gamestop will be taking a *considerably* heavier loss, especially if the borrow rate stays elevated.\n\nPositions:\n\nGME shares because I have no fucking idea what options will do if this time bomb goes off.

        "selftext": "Alright the Friday before Labor Day I took big hit in the market correction and have been bleeding ever since. Mind you Im new to trading. I've been looking on here and a few other subs (all over the web really) and was taking direct advice and quickly learned - stop that shit.  There's a lot of just \"fun\" on here or whatever and I need no filler, no nonsense news/ tips/ hints. So after learning and adjusting from my loss/es I've learned a few things and this is kind of where I'm at mentally:\n\n* I have to stop panicking and leaving good positions when they go slightly against me and let them play out- if I did proper DD.\n* Because I have a small account I have to look for trades that will at least play out positively for at least one trading day because I can't exit positions intraday freely as if I'm day trading.\n* Stick to quality, reputable companies.\n* I will say even though Im against just following whats posted here this sub does have a knack for mentioning stocks that will move big and keeping a constant flow of key news whether it's breaking last minute news or an event a few weeks out so I'm learning to stay tuned in but play the moments based on my own thoughts.\n\nAnd that's about it, I don't really know technical analysis and I think that's killing me. I researched MACD, RSI, SMA/ EMA &amp; Bollinger Bands but they're not on RH as futures like on Webull or ToS so I don't use them much. I've been entering stocks late in the pump/moon and catching the ride down, I also lost big playing earnings for either GME or SWBI. I still think earnings are good opportunities I just don't know how to read the situations properly.\n\nAlso should I stick with Robinhood or switch brokers. I like it just wish the charting had more features and the 9:30 -10:00 time area were better with filling orders.\n\nThat's where I'm at mentally. I think I should take 4- 6 weeks off based off my losses and just learn  and take another stab at it. I was starting to make money but the Labor Day correction shook things up for me.\n\nAny advice, any books I should read, series' I should watch... I'm open to it all, I'm serious about trying to succeed in the market so I'm not giving up but I've lost enough that I'm getting more realistic and learning to respect the ups and downs of the market. I gotta really come up with a game plan to do this.\n\nCurrent plays for me right now:\n\nKODK $14.5c 09/25\n\nLAC $12.5c 10/16",

The same geniuses throwing money at [companies with no revenue](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA), [colors](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL), and [companies whose competitors are giving out their products for free](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM). I'm going to tell you why everyone is buying it and why /u/DeepFuckingValue is going to be a multi-millionaire soon.\n\n## Short squeeze\n**GME is one of the most shorted stocks**: 55M of 65M shares are short, including [&gt;100% of float](https://www.highshortinterest.com/). Based on average volume, it would take the over 15 days for all shorts to cover. More than half the shorts entered under $7 and are now taking losses. **A price spike from good news could trigger a [short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze) and force shorts to cover at higher and higher prices**. If only there were good news...\n\n## Enter Ryan Cohen\nIn 2011, Ryan started competing with Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Costco to sell a commodity. Despite [historic failures by predecessors](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/dotcom-pets-dot-com.asp), he thought he could prevail by focusing on customer service. He ended up selling [his company](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHWY) for $3B, and now it is worth $27B. Since then, Ryan has been very selective about investments, saying no to [99.9% of opportunities](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#63e0b2d25579) and investing only in AAPL, WFC, and... GME?!?\n\n**Last Friday, Ryan filed a [13D](http://news.gamestop.com/node/18181/html) indicating he bought a 9% stake in GME.** The [updated filing](https://newsfilter.io/a/6b966651795e12f76f45b301d8227a7f) shows that he bought 415K shares yesterday, including 100K at $6.726, and now owns a 9.6% stake. He might continue buying, but we won't know until after Q2 earnings next Wednesday. Since the filing, GME is up ~40% and [short borrowing costs have increased from 3.9% to 8.5%](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME).\n\nBut why would he get into GameStop? People are as fanatical about games as they are about pets. He doesn't have to build a company from scratch - he can take the Chewy focus on customer service and Chewify GameStop. He is also joined by James Symancyk, former CEO of PetSmart, who is on the boards of both PetSmart and GameStop.\n\n**Ryan's additional changes the whole trajectory of the company**, no longer with terminal value 0. Don't forget GameStop owns [ThinkGeek](https://www.gamestop.com/toys-collectibles/thinkgeek) and has been shifting into toys and collectibles. But even within games there is an upcoming catalyst...\n\n## New console cycle\nNew hardware is not very profitable for Gamestop, but resales are. A new console cycle means that people will get rid of old consoles via trade-ins, which Gamestop can then sell a healthy margins.\n\nRyan Cohen is long GME, Michael Burry is long CME, and even [the guy who bashes GameStop on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf1Wt2HEllOSeQzKz2-GNDA) is [long GME](https://stocktwits.com/message/240323066). GME is still trading below book value. Get in while you can.\n\n$20C 01/15/2021",

        "selftext": "After a few days of research I\u2019ve come up with more information on the workings of this. If any information is in accurate or misunderstood on my part feel free to to correct me; I am by no means an expert. \n\nAs I have come to understand, a security will make the list after failing to deliver shares for a position. Time starts ticking day one, and at day T+3 it makes the list if the dollar value of the position meets the threshold established by the SEC. This is most often associated with opening short positions, as the shares for the short position must be borrowed to be sold. \n\nHOWEVER from what I\u2019ve managed to gather; the position is allowed to be opened and it becomes the brokers responsibility to then find shares to borrow after the fact. They do not need to be available at the time of the order being opened. This is where a stock making the list comes into play. After 13 days however, any positions opened that still have not had shares located to fulfill the brokers obligation MUST be closed, and the must be bought from from the open market. \n\nNow as I originally started my research into this to make my decision for GME, I will use that as an example. They made the list the 22nd. That would make the original date of failure to deliver the 16th. So if my understanding is correct, and it may not be 100%, the 29th would start the forced closing of all positions which have not had sufficient amounts of shares located for borrow. \n\nAside from my original purpose of researching this, it seems this list would be a powerful tool to find possible squeeze candidates. Critique and further in depth explanation welcome. This is not financial advice, flame away whatever I don\u2019t give a fuck. Happy hunting autismo\u2019s",

VALE is a mining company based in Brazil that is supposedly the world's largest iron and nickel ore producer.  Metals are supposedly on the up, so yay or whatever.  I'm sure you all remember [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iuk3h0/wanna_play_tsla_but_no_money_vale/) by our current resident persona non grata u/ExtraEgg.  IMO it was pretty solid DD up until the conspiracy theories involving Elon sending coded messages through his tweets, and one would think that EVs needing nickel for batteries would have a positive effect on the largest nickel miner in the world, but something nefarious is going on, and it may have something to do with us, the retail trader and WSB.\n\nThe MMs and dark pools know more than we do, that's a given with just about anything.  They typically play us like a fiddle and feast on our ignorance and stupidity.  Some have admitted to doing so, as referenced by the article a couple weeks ago highlighting Wall Street poring over WSB to find out what we were piling into so they could make money off us.  This may be such a play, and I'm convinced it was designed to take the shirts off the backs of retail traders from the get-go.\n\nSo real quick about dark pools:  they're exactly what they sound like.  Large funds that are allowed to make big block trades without screwing with price action.  They should be illegal, but like most aspects of the market, they were designed to manage their risk and fuck us over at the same time.\n\n[So here's what the dark pools have been doing with VALE.](https://i.imgur.com/YTsSJPu.png)  This is all action from today, 9/29.  These are big fucking blocks of shares being bought, obviously by dark pools, because if you didn't notice, Vale got nominal price action early today and then shat itself as usual.  This is what people are pointing to when they say there is big buy volume going on in VALE.  But there's another type of volume spiking, and it's what really gets the Twitter pumpers frothing at the mouth.\n\nThese are the insane call volumes that people have been shouting about, this was today:\n\n[31k contracts of VALE 15c 1/15/21 for $272k](https://i.imgur.com/S0ZaqSQ.png)\n\n[15k contracts of VALE 15c 3/19/21 for $225k](https://i.imgur.com/m7FXtui.png)\n\n[2.2k contracts of VALE 12c 1/21/22 for $243k](https://i.imgur.com/6bwbQjB.png)\n\nObviously those are big numbers, and people have been shouting about them for over a week and they're still being bought, but I haven't seen much mention of the puts:\n\n[31k contracts of VALE 15p 1/15/21 for $14.53 million fucking dollars American](https://i.imgur.com/Zb8zc25.png)\n\n[15k contracts of VALE 15p 3/19/21 for $7.55m](https://i.imgur.com/6CDkfMB.png)\n\n[5k contracts of VALE 10p 1/21/22 for $1.04m](https://i.imgur.com/dDZBmcM.png)\n\nHonestly I didn't have to make an entire post to say the insane call option volume is simply a hedge, but I need to work through this because it's so belligerent it's making my head spin.  What about the insane share blocks being bought?  As u/gege12345572 [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j272rv/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_september_30_2020/g745agi/), it's possible that they're intent on selling us as many calls as they can since our call volume the last couple weeks has been insane and some, like my retarded self, have been steadily averaging down as recently as Friday.  It could also be another part of the hedge.  This whole thing could be some elaborate stage play where insiders have information on the CEO of VALE diddling kiddos or something and cash out big on the puts, then ride it back up when nickel rises in value.  I don't fucking know, but they're buying HUGE amounts of deep ITM puts and OTM calls stretching all the way to 2022.  Make of that what you will.\n\nMy advice: get out if you're still in.  Unless you're already max pain like I am.  Then godspeed, you lunatics.  The calls are so fucking cheap for leaps that if you're a gambling addict or believe the hedge isn't really a hedge but an actual play, then go ahead.  But this is sinister, my dudes.  These guys know what's up and we just don't.  The end, bye bye.",

Lets dive in.\n\nNobody should buy this stock. Its terrible. Going to zero! Im shorting! Big debt, negative EPS. Dont get caught holding the GME bag.\n\nHowever,\n\nThere is a *RISK* the share price could *DOUBLE* before going to zero as the new console cycle will bring lots of FCF to the stores.  We now know that physical game disks will still be in high demand as the digital only console specs are much weaker and have restricted backwards compatibility compared to the disk version console. This will give GME a big boost to revenue when it comes to trade-ins, where their profit margins are highest.\n\n\\- They have heavily reduced their SG&amp;A, closing unprofitable stores, restructured debt so they can continue without worry until 2023 if they cant manage to turn things around. Their y/y comps from 2020 -&gt; 2021 should show a huge improvement which the market has not priced in.\n\n\\- Recently the chewy founder has taken a 10% stake in GME as they look to transform themselves into an e-commerce business model, launching a new app and possibly turning stores into semi-fulfillment centers/ in store gaming hubs in the near future.\n\n\\- The management team has done stock buybacks to reduce outstanding shares from &gt;100M to 65million making the SP more volatile to the upside if MC improves.\n\n\\- If GME was to have a market cap of 1Billion which is still quite low (prior console cycle saw GME mrkt cap at +$4b) the share price would need to be $15.\n\n\\- Short interest is &gt;100%, so a potential short squeeze would bring us huge *LOSSES*\n\nDont let the MM's know that the SP could *DOUBLE* in the medium term. They might use that info against our *retail short position*\n\nOk *RETAILS*, here is our position\n\nBuy puts of any strike at least 2 months out or just short sell.

A couple of big brains said the upcoming consoles are going to save this bankrupt company with targets at $8 and $10 but I am here to shine a light on this run up. First off even with extensive video game sales this company is not appreciating to last years levels. It is already destined to bankrupt so even with a good holiday season what are they going to be able to invest in to protect them from the ebb of the console cycle? Even with strong sales they will probably still lose money at peak revenue! \n\nSecond there has been a ton of weird activity at the $15 price target. I would bet this scheme is a plot to pump money into this company to make returns on way OTM options contracts and then to crash it so that they expire worthless. Maybe this is GameStop's new business model?\n\nTLDR: Don't fall for the curtain tricks of the elite MMs behind this GME run up. Trust me instead.",

        "selftext": "GameStop **GME** has been going downhill for the past several years due to the digital market for video games. No longer am I forced to bring my fifty discs back to my local GameStop and have them offer me a used bedpan and a spit in the face. Now I can just buy the game online and download it without having to deal with the 400lb McLady neckbeard who works at GameStop during the day and WSB moderates at night.\n\nHowever, GameStop recently had an uptick and you autists are probably wondering why. Well I'll give you my DD written on a shit stained napkin.  \n\n\n*So* there is this guy called Ryan Cohen. This is the man who founded **Chewy.com** **CHWY** an online dog food retailer. Now right after making his $600 million dollars off of $BECKY moms who don't know where the local PetSmart is. This man randomly decided to buy a large stake of **GME**  and starts spouting about his plans to turn it into the next **Amazon AMZN**. ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000699/rc13da2-091820.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000699/rc13da2-091820.htm))\n\n([https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/22/gamestop-rises-sharply-on-disclosure-of-talks-with/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/22/gamestop-rises-sharply-on-disclosure-of-talks-with/))\n\n([https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-stock-price-chewy-investor-plans-amazon-rival-ecommerce-2020-9](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-stock-price-chewy-investor-plans-amazon-rival-ecommerce-2020-9))\n\nThis is the majority reason GameStop had a large spike.\n\nI've been to **GME** once in the last five years and there was a homeless man eating a corndog behind the counter and I wasn't sure if he worked there or not. Gay bears stop reading now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the Bulls are dead, the bulls market has ended? I think not. Together we are strong and we hold more power than the boys on Wall St. Always remember when the chips are down the autists have an extra surge of strength. This is commonly referred to as tard strength, this is us.  \n\n\nNow lets get to the actual fucking **DD** now that the foreplay is over with. **\\~\\~START HERE IF YOUR ON THE SPECTRUM\\~\\~**  \n\n\n**GME** has had a rough time over the last five years, with thousands of brick and mortar stores closing and people realizing that digital is the new storage medium of choice for games. However, this year is different. People are stuck inside due to the pandemic, buying more games online and having them shipped to them, remember Chads don't understand complex digital stores and prefer their CDs.   \n\n\nUS Furry Association founder **Ryan Cohen** has a chance to breath life back into this decrepit soul. The last major console war and sale was in Q4 of 2013. Seven years ago. This console upgrade cycle will be the largest since the Xbox One and PS4 came out. Already most major retailers are struggling to accept preordered and they are flying off the shelves. This is free money for **GME.**  \n\n\nIn 2013 Q3 **GME** had a revenue of $2.11 billion. The following Q4 2013 had a revenue of  $3.68 billion. This trend stays true every year there is a major increase in next gen console sales. In Q3 2020 **GME** had a revenue of  $1.09 billion, with the prior year Q3 2019 being  $ 1.44 billion . This is within the standard deviation of change, and this is during a pandemic! If the trend stays true revenue is poised to be an increase from Q3 to Q4.\n\n  \n\n\n[GME 2013](https://preview.redd.it/l1v9g8n8p5p51.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdb51bb40e47850b4fdbc4f24b570849e37c39eb)\n\nNow while this doesn't sound like amazing news and more like autistic general knowledge, that's true. But this combined with the other news may mean something else entirely.   \n\n\n**Ryan Cohen** has connections with many intuitional investors and has just bought a sizeable controlling portion of **GME**. Now many would wonder why someone would waste money on **GME**, the reason is something most autists on Wall St. look over. **CASH BALANCES.** **GME** is ***RICH*** in cash right now. With the majority of the stock market on massive discount and people looking for jobs their $700 million dollar balance of cash holdings is very enticing. **Cohen** has said he wants to turn **GME** into the next **Amazon AMZN.** With the closing of brick and mortar stores and the huge cash balance this leaves **GME** poised for growth. This combined with recent growth and the upcoming console sales will help push **GME** into being a household name again.   \n\n\n([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/cash-on-hand](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/cash-on-hand))  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](xesim8okp5p51 \"GME Cash Balance\n\")\n\n**TLDR: GameStop converting to dog food production under the management of a furry. Will go to the moon because CHADS want their new consoles.**  \n\n\nNews:  \n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454637/ps5-playstation5-preorder-restock-gamestop-date](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454637/ps5-playstation5-preorder-restock-gamestop-date)",

        "selftext": " **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, Sept 22, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily before rising in another very volatile session, with traders weighing uncertainty around the presidential election, a worsening coronavirus situation in Europe, and concerns that fiscal stimulus will not come in near-term.  The Nasdaq outperformed, rose 1.86% as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) increased. The S&amp;P finished 1.02% and the Dow finished the day 0.5% up.\n\nThe coronavirus situation in Europe has greatly worsened, with experts and politicians warning that a second-wave is around the corner. On September 12, French authorities reported 10,000 COVID-19 cases in one day for the first time since the pandemic began. Since then, daily cases have soared to more than 13,000. Several \"red zones\", cities considered high risk, have seen clampdowns. There is much talk of a second national lockdown in the UK, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcing that there will be further restrictive measures aimed at containing another major outbreak, as the number of cases swells and top scientists warn that the death rate could grow exponentially. On Monday, the UK reported 4,368 new cases. In Spain, parts of the capital Madrid, saw new lockdown measures enforced on Monday. More than 850,000 residents face restrictions on travel and the size of gatherings, according to Al Jazeera. The EU CDC reported that in Spain, there were 300 cases of COVID-19 per every 100,000 people as the capital of Madrid saw new lockdown measures being enforced.\n\nProspects of more fiscal stimulus passing before the November election have dimmed, with Congress unable to come to a consensus. Today, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee. They said that the Fed and Treasury can only go \u2018so far so fast\u2019 and cannot replace targeted aid from Congress. \u201cThe recovery will go faster if we have both tools \\[from the Fed and Congress\\] continuing to work together,\" Powell said. Both Powell and Mnuchin credited the Cares Act for helping the economy recover at the height of the pandemic but have once again stressed to Congressional lawmakers the importance of targeted, fiscal aid in helping families and small businesses through these tough times.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Raymond James from $110 to $120 OUTPERFORM. The stock finished 1.57% up.\n* ACN Accenture, currently at $233. Stock finished the day 1.29% up.\n   * Piper Sandler Raised Target $206 to $229 NEUTRAL\n   * Wedbush raised target from $240 to $255 OUTPERFORM\n* Amazon (AMZN) target raised bySanford C. Bernstein upgraded from MARKET PERFORM to OUTPERFORM price target of $3,400. Stock finished the day \n* Carvana (CVNA) ran 30.61% after the company projected a \u201crecord Q3\u201d and was upgraded to a BUY rating by Goldman Sachs (GS)\n* Carvana (CVNA) was upgraded by Goldman Sachs $GS from $178 to $205, and NEUTRAL to BUY.  Q3 guidance was updated on the positive side and the stock took off. Finished 30% up for the day.\n* (CZR) Caesars Entertainment, Deutsche Bank raised its target from $50 to $65 at BUY\n* (FB) Facebook had Oppenheimer raise target from $270 to $300 OUTPERFORM\n* (NKE) Nike had Robert W. Baird raise target from $95 to $115 and from POSITIVE to NEUTRAL.\n* (NKE) Nike after the bell reported better than expected Q1 sales and EPS of $0.95 up from $0.86 YoY. The stock was up 3.1% for regular session and already more than 8% after hours.\n* (NFLX) Netflix had JP Morgan set Target $625 at BUY. that is about 20% higher than ATH, very bullish.\n* Today is (TSLA) Tesla Battery Day. Stay tuned for potential price moving announcements.\n* (GME) Gamestop surges on announcement that Cohen, Chewy\u2019s founder, revealed an almost 10% stake in the company and his intention to become involved and compete with Amazon on the videogame space, just as he did pets with (CHWY) Chewy.\n* (SFIX) Stitch Fix reported worse than expected results, a loss of $0.44 vs expectation of a loss of $0.14. Shares were up 8% for the day, and now 14% down after hours.",

        "selftext": "What a difference a week makes. As [I wrote previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/idxxe2/a_lot_of_gamma_expiring_today_will_volatility/) how a lot of gamma was set to roll off after August expiration and it looks like that's partially responsible for some of the bigger moves in the market this past week. I also [wrote](https://www.optionseye.com/draftkings-dkng-earnings-preview/) about how a lot of that upside skew we were seeing in big tech names and story stocks had the options market all out of whack. I attributed it to retail flow (YOLO) crowd and it turns out Softbank was in on that game. Wild stuff. That was partially responsible for some of those blow-off tops we saw in names like TSLA.\n\nAs far as what's next, options are back to pricing in wild swings across the market and that may mean looking at some of the earnings moves a little differently. How much are the expected moves in the earnings stocks (below) this week pricing their earnings, and how much is pricing big market moves. My guess is options are now overpricing earnings moves themselves, so the market is the bigger driver for now. Let me know if anything missing you want to see of have any questions below.

Thus, in the event of a very bullish news, we would suddenly see a surge of buyers which could trigger one of the greatest short squeezes to have ever existed lasting near 18 days for brokers to make all of their margin calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[5-year Bearish Momentum](https://preview.redd.it/ejxk7qy5rsk51.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dec5d194ea82de79f61f55ca4b86473fe559d73)\n\nGME was trading near $60 5 years ago, but the only path it saw from there on forth was downwards. However, we've seen a 50% growth in the past 3 days and held up pretty strong today despite all the market push-backs. This was one solid uptick due to a famous entrepreneur revealing that he was still hoarding GME stocks and going as far as upping the ante through the purchase of an additional 400k shares. \n\nNow, consider the event of an earnings beat-down on Sept 9 at the closing bell. \n\nNeed I say more?\n\n**How I would play this** \\- buy up large amounts of shares and hold them until post earnings (but don't throw your entire portfolio into shares. Leave around 5%\\~10% as you'll need them to purchase calls). This will keep the demand healthy and of course more people will buy in due to the hype/stock and the potential short squeeze. Don't expect a short squeeze before earnings because likely, there will not be much action from here. Calls aren't even worth it for the run-up due to the high IV on Sept/Oct calls so your returns from your run-up (if it actually does have one) might be marginal than actually buying shares. Finally, on Sept 9 before ER release, throw the 5%\\~10% that you had reserved into October calls. \n\nThis strategy, in my opinion, is the most conservatively-aggressive, optimally risk hedging approach that would allow you to partake in what could be a max tendie reaping while also, limiting your losses if the short squeeze does not happen.",

        "selftext": "GameStop **GME** has been going downhill for the past several years due to the digital market for video games. No longer am I forced to bring my fifty discs back to my local GameStop and have them offer me a used bedpan and a spit in the face. Now I can just buy the game online and download it without having to deal with the 400lb McLady neckbeard who works at GameStop during the day and WSB moderates at night.  \n\n\nHowever, GameStop recently had an uptick and you autists are probably wondering why. Well I'll give you my DD written on a shit stained napkin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*So* there is this guy called Ryan Cohen. This is the man who founded **Chewy.com** **CHWY** an online dog food retailer. Now right after making his $600 million dollars off of $BECKY moms who don't know where the local PetSmart is. This man randomly decided to buy a large stake of **GME**  and starts spouting about his plans to turn it into the next **Amazon AMZN**. ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000699/rc13da2-091820.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000699/rc13da2-091820.htm))\n\n([https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/22/gamestop-rises-sharply-on-disclosure-of-talks-with/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/22/gamestop-rises-sharply-on-disclosure-of-talks-with/))\n\n([https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-stock-price-chewy-investor-plans-amazon-rival-ecommerce-2020-9](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-stock-price-chewy-investor-plans-amazon-rival-ecommerce-2020-9))\n\nThis is the majority reason GameStop had a large spike.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow lets get to the actual fucking **DD** now that the foreplay is over with. **\\~\\~START HERE IF YOUR ON THE SPECTRUM\\~\\~**\n\nThe last major console upgrade was in Q4 of 2013. This was the Xbox One and PS4 console war, very similar to the console battle going on currently. In this year there was a similar uptick around September, followed by downward movement prior to October/November. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME 2013](https://preview.redd.it/i3z24va5g5p51.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c47f7495505707e91e9bdc0882957dc5132dc0)\n\nDuring this Q4 2013 **GME** had a reported revenue of  3.68 billion. With a prior Q3 2013 revenue of  2.11  Billion. This was a 18.8% increase to the prior year, with no new consoles announced. Now in comparison we have this year Q3 2020 slated with $1.09 billion in revenue. While there are many causations for this decrease in revenue some of the main include: old infrastructure, dying market share, and sweaty neckbeards dying off due to Covid. The greatest reason is due to the pandemic closing down their in person stores, their bread and butter.\n\n**Now** **GME** has had a rough go over the last five years. Closing thousands of brick and mortar stores. Now this looks awful to any investor, and even you autists have probably stayed away from it. *However*, there is a bonus to closing all these stores. **GME** has become ***Cash Rich***. **GME** has over $700 *million* in cash holdings. ([https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/12/gamestop-is-cash-rich-but-growth-poor/#:\\~:text=Financial%20wins&amp;text=GameStop%20counts%20over%20%24700%20million,above%20its%20current%20market%20capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/12/gamestop-is-cash-rich-but-growth-poor/#:~:text=Financial%20wins&amp;text=GameStop%20counts%20over%20%24700%20million,above%20its%20current%20market%20capitalization).).\n\n  \nIn addition to this $700 million in cash holdings past trends of **GME** revenue during console war years show the company is essentially given free money by Xbox and PlayStation. People have to buy their refrigerators and routers from someone and since all the major retailers have been selling out so quick in preorders that their sites have been struggling to keep up. ([https://www.tomshardware.com/news/xbox-series-x-name-confusion-amazon](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/xbox-series-x-name-confusion-amazon)). It's going to be a green quarter for **GME**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow then this combined **Ryan Cohen** (remember him? the furry guy) taking a large interest in **GME** can spell for a revival of the household classic game company. With the amount of funds that Cohen can bring in with investors and the amount of cash rich holdings **GME** already has, and the decreasing amount of brick and mortar sales. This leaves **GME** poised to become a competitor to **Amazon** **AMZN** and other online game market places. With the amount of money and know how under Cohen's management I can see an update to the **GME** web store coming in the future and a change in their business model, moving more towards competing with other online retailers and completely dissolving their physical properties. With the upcoming console sales they will see a rise in revenue and stock valuation and this combined with the other news has a good chance of pushing **GME** back into the online retailer space.  \n\n\n**TLDR: GameStop is going to turn into a dog food retailer and turn physical locations into Pet Salons. Also the stock will rocket to the moon because console sales will make the neckbeards and chads come together.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNews:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2020/09/24/what-time-gamestop-getting-new-stock-for-ps5--pre-orders-heres-when/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2020/09/24/what-time-gamestop-getting-new-stock-for-ps5--pre-orders-heres-when/)",

        "selftext": "What's up people of stocks, some of you may have seen my unusual options activity posts in other option's trading sub-reddits. I've decided to put together a little summary for the week that details some trending tickers, option activity, and some setups for next week ( + reasoning for the setup). Mods if this isn't allowed, I won't post again. Here we go:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Upcoming Earnings\n\nMicron (MU) Earnings are coming up this week. The semi-conductor company has been consistently beating earnings and has seen some growth throughout the pandemic as more companies become increasingly tech-focused with work-from-home orders. Here\u2019s a snapshot of their most recent earnings and performance moves day-after the report. \n\n[https://imgur.com/stDsUEx](https://imgur.com/stDsUEx)\n\n**What to look for**\n\nBy proxy, companies that will see some related movements to MU\u2019s earnings are: AMD, INTC, and NVDA. A good showing from MU will also mean good things for other semi-conductor companies.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at MU\u2019s average options\u2019 Implied Volatility (IV) over the last month. We can see that typical IV is in the 40-45% range. When the stock price dropped early September during the crash, we saw IV get up to the 60\u2019s. IV has begun to dip back into the 40\u2019s meaning there is not a huge move expected off the earnings report. (Stock price is gold vs IV blue line). \n\n[https://imgur.com/87nthwQ](https://imgur.com/87nthwQ)\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nWe have some important economic data coming out this week. Here\u2019s the outlook:\n\nTuesday 10am: Consumer Confidence\n\nWednesday 8:30am: GDP Q2, Pending Home Sales\n\nThursday 8:30am: Jobless claims\n\nFriday 8:30am: Unemployment Rate\n\n**Full Calendar of Important Events w/ Forecasts (via Bloomberg):** \n\n[https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC](https://imgur.com/1XEHPyC)\n\n# Trending Stocks\n\nMost Mentioned Tickers + Sentiment from Friday \n\n[https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO](https://imgur.com/jTw7JiO)\n\n# This week\u2019s trend gainers and losers\n\n**Losing Hype:** TSLA, VALE, NKLA, MSFT, WMT, AAPL\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB](https://imgur.com/0wdvTJB)\n\n**Gaining Hype:** BA, VXX, ZM, AAL, UPS, PTON, MU\n\n[https://imgur.com/hpakS2h](https://imgur.com/hpakS2h)\n\n\\*AAPL was losing hype on the weekly trend, but up on the daily trend Thursday &amp; Friday from a good performance.  \n\n# Consolidating Tickers\n\nThese tickers are ones that have once been a \u201cmeme\u201d, but have since settled down, and perhaps a good entry point if your technicals are right, it aligns with your strategy, and want to avoid FOMO-ing into hot stocks. \n\n[https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a](https://imgur.com/5YsYE1a)\n\n# The classic tale of doing the inverse of WSB\n\nToday we\u2019ll take a look at VALE, a stock that was almost never mentioned a single time in the last month on r/WallStreetBets until September 18th. At that point, the stock had risen 10% in the week before and VALE was then seen all over the comment section of the sub. Comment volume for VALE jumped to 10% of total comment volume on the sub-reddit at which point many WSB members initiated positions. Within the next several trading days the stock tanked 15% leaving WSB holding the bag (yet again). For more details on this, please read \u201cHow not to FOMO into trades\u201d. \n\n[https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B](https://imgur.com/oZ7xY0B)\n\n**Swaggy DD (due diligence) released this week - GME (Gamestop)** \n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\nWhen I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn\u2019t take very long to see comments like these, yet here we are. What\u2019s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wallstreetbets thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week.\n\nIts no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software \u2013 under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.\n\n**II. CONSOLES**\n\nJust to start things off, you have to remember we\u2019re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop\u2019s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically spiked.\n\n[Click here to continue reading the DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/)\n\n# Swaggy Play &amp; Trade Idea - JPM\n\nWhat's up everyone, market has been choppy as FK and almost un-tradeable the last several weeks. Still, not much has changed fundamentally over the last 3-4 weeks and here we are with a 10-20% haircut on stocks depending which tickers you follow. I've been sitting on my hands for a while, but entered a trade today. Keep in mind this is not advice on what or how to trade, simply posting my trade here and if you want to discuss some opinions, lets do it.\n\nWhy JPM? It has been in a fairly tight channel over the last 3-4 months, staying in the range of $90-100. I entered this exact play back in July when the stock dropped to similar levels to where it is currently at right now, and closed at max profit back then. \n\n[Check out the full play details (reasoning + risks)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/izmt2r/swaggyplay_trade_idea_jpm/)\n\n# Unusual Option Activity\n\nSome big volume in option flow was spotted this week in some names: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, and WRTC.\n\n**ADBE \u2013 Adobe**\n\nADBE saw a massive call block come through on Friday. 5,000 January 2021 CALLs at the $420 strike (10% ITM). Total position size was $40 million. ADBE was about 10-15% off the recent highs and has bounced multiple times off the $470 level. IF this sell-off is truly over, we might see a good bounce in tech and some of these block purchases seem to be positioning for it. \n\n[Read Full Post: Weekly Option Flow Summary, Week of Sept 20-2020: AAPL, ADBE, C, CLDR, ORCL, PBR, WRTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/j0rev4/unusual_option_flow_summary_for_the_week_aapl/)\n\n**What\u2019s on the watchlist this week**\n\nStill looking for a bounce in tech. Here are some stocks I either like and have a position or I\u2019m looking for entry points on (stock price + Implied Volatility charts)\n\n**AAPL - Apple**  \n\nAAPL is currently near a short-term low. Does it have room to go down more? Sure, but I think when you dig below the current levels you will be finding more buyers as we get closer to $100. IMO a good entry point for a long-term hold. IV is also moderately high for options. They are set to report earnings by end of October and also have catalyst of rumored 5g iPhone release.\n\n**AMD - Advanced Micro Devices**  \n\nAMD has shown some strength at the $78 level of support through these last few weeks of downside pressure. AMD also reports towards the end of October, but will have some volatility into MU (Micron Technology) earnings next week. IV is pretty high right now for AMD to buy calls. A more efficient play might be to sell CSP (cash-secured put), credit PUT spreads, or purchase shares.\n\n**DOCU - Docusign**  \n\nA second-wave covid-play I\u2019m looking at is DOCU. DOCU just reported earnings that weren\u2019t accepted well by Wall Street. The stock has dropped nearly 30% since it\u2019s peak of $290 not long ago. You can also see the IV has dropped significantly after earnings. Average IV was as high as 140% pre-earnings and is now sitting around 55%. IMO this is a fundamentally strong company with solid branding. If you\u2019ve ever needed to sign important documents online, chances are you\u2019ve used Docusign before and it is quickly becoming a household name. I like this play for a long-term hold and also as we get into the fall months as a covid play.",

        "selftext": " **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, Sept 22, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily before rising in another very volatile session, with traders weighing uncertainty around the presidential election, a worsening coronavirus situation in Europe, and concerns that fiscal stimulus will not come in near-term.  The Nasdaq outperformed, rose 1.86% as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) increased. The S&amp;P finished 1.02% and the Dow finished the day 0.5% up.\n\nThe coronavirus situation in Europe has greatly worsened, with experts and politicians warning that a second-wave is around the corner. On September 12, French authorities reported 10,000 COVID-19 cases in one day for the first time since the pandemic began. Since then, daily cases have soared to more than 13,000. Several \"red zones\", cities considered high risk, have seen clampdowns. There is much talk of a second national lockdown in the UK, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcing that there will be further restrictive measures aimed at containing another major outbreak, as the number of cases swells and top scientists warn that the death rate could grow exponentially. On Monday, the UK reported 4,368 new cases. In Spain, parts of the capital Madrid, saw new lockdown measures enforced on Monday. More than 850,000 residents face restrictions on travel and the size of gatherings, according to Al Jazeera. The EU CDC reported that in Spain, there were 300 cases of COVID-19 per every 100,000 people as the capital of Madrid saw new lockdown measures being enforced.\n\nProspects of more fiscal stimulus passing before the November election have dimmed, with Congress unable to come to a consensus. Today, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee. They said that the Fed and Treasury can only go \u2018so far so fast\u2019 and cannot replace targeted aid from Congress. \u201cThe recovery will go faster if we have both tools \\[from the Fed and Congress\\] continuing to work together,\" Powell said. Both Powell and Mnuchin credited the Cares Act for helping the economy recover at the height of the pandemic but have once again stressed to Congressional lawmakers the importance of targeted, fiscal aid in helping families and small businesses through these tough times.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Raymond James from $110 to $120 OUTPERFORM. The stock finished 1.57% up.\n* ACN Accenture, currently at $233. Stock finished the day 1.29% up.\n   * Piper Sandler Raised Target $206 to $229 NEUTRAL\n   * Wedbush raised target from $240 to $255 OUTPERFORM\n* Amazon (AMZN) target raised bySanford C. Bernstein upgraded from MARKET PERFORM to OUTPERFORM price target of $3,400. Stock finished the day \n* Carvana (CVNA) ran 30.61% after the company projected a \u201crecord Q3\u201d and was upgraded to a BUY rating by Goldman Sachs (GS)\n* Carvana (CVNA) was upgraded by Goldman Sachs $GS from $178 to $205, and NEUTRAL to BUY.  Q3 guidance was updated on the positive side and the stock took off. Finished 30% up for the day.\n* (CZR) Caesars Entertainment, Deutsche Bank raised its target from $50 to $65 at BUY\n* (FB) Facebook had Oppenheimer raise target from $270 to $300 OUTPERFORM\n* (NKE) Nike had Robert W. Baird raise target from $95 to $115 and from POSITIVE to NEUTRAL.\n* (NKE) Nike after the bell reported better than expected Q1 sales and EPS of $0.95 up from $0.86 YoY. The stock was up 3.1% for regular session and already more than 8% after hours.\n* (NFLX) Netflix had JP Morgan set Target $625 at BUY. that is about 20% higher than ATH, very bullish.\n* Today is (TSLA) Tesla Battery Day. Stay tuned for potential price moving announcements.\n* (GME) Gamestop surges on announcement that Cohen, Chewy\u2019s founder, revealed an almost 10% stake in the company and his intention to become involved and compete with Amazon on the videogame space, just as he did pets with (CHWY) Chewy.\n* (SFIX) Stitch Fix reported worse than expected results, a loss of $0.44 vs expectation of a loss of $0.14. Shares were up 8% for the day, and now 14% down after hours.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 7th, 2020.\n\n# **The stock market shakeout is likely not over yet, even with Friday\u2019s comeback  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/the-stock-market-shakeout-is-likely-not-over-yet-even-with-fridays-comeback.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The tech wreck is probably not over, despite Friday\u2019s market comeback.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect the shakeout in stocks to continue after the long Labor Day weekend, especially in technology names and the Nasdaq, areas of the market that notched the sharpest gains.\n*****\n&gt; After August\u2019s 7% gain in the S&amp;P 500, stocks started September strong, and then just as quickly rolled over. The Nasdaq lost 5% Thursday and was down sharply Friday but pared losses to decline 1.5%. The S&amp;P 500 was down about 2.3% for the week, even after a 3.5% loss Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is a good wake-up call and a reminder that there are risks out there,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cIn August, we did take a little bit off the table.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Analysts expect the week ahead to be busy, with holidays ending and more market pros back at their desks. There is some economic data, most importantly Friday\u2019s consumer price index. The reading on consumer inflation is expected to show little change in core inflation with forecasts for a gain of just 0.2% in August, or 1.6% year over year.\n*****\n&gt; # Froth blowing off\n&gt; The stock sell-off came as market pros were becoming increasingly wary of froth in the market, particularly in tech and momentum names. On Friday, it was revealed that SoftBank was behind billions in large options bets on individual tech stocks, like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla. News reports said the trades were made over the past month, and SoftBank had been building unusually large positions in call options, or those that bet the prices of underlying stocks would rise.\n*****\n&gt; One analyst said the fact that SoftBank was \u201cgunning the market\u201d makes him worry that there is more selling to come in Nasdaq names. As SoftBank bought call options, the sellers had to buy stocks, conceivably driving up prices in a trading feedback loop.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a trip to the casino,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cIf they\u2019re supposed to be an investment company taking a long-term horizon, then trying to juice your short-term return through options, you\u2019ve turned into a hedge fund.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan strategists said they expect the market to recover gradually, but there are still presidential election uncertainties looming in the next couple of months.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe significant reduction in previously extreme long positions in Nasdaq by momentum traders should allow the equity market to recover over the coming weeks, as happened after the June 11th correction,\u201d noted JPMorgan analysts. \u201cBut a repeat of the strong gains seen during July and August is less likely over the next two months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there could be more selling in the tech and internet companies, or those that were viewed did well as workers stayed home and the economy was shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s not the start of a big lasting correction, but a forewarning the next couple of weeks and months are going to be choppy. I think it\u2019s going to be a sideways kind of market,\u201d Grohowski said. He added the market could be choppy in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re a little more cautious, not to mention the market is trading at 23 times our earnings estimates for 2021,\u201d said Grohowski. He said the fact there is about $4.5 trillion in money market funds is a bullish signm since that money could find its way into the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the S&amp;P 500 could dip to its 200-day moving average, or 3,092, before rebounding, which would be about a 15% move in total.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think the sell-off is over. Nasdaq is up 83%s since March 23, the S&amp;P is up 63%,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/34qCxpv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/1u5feMS.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WfvTGox.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/sDw87zF7/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bUFp72p.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cgvDyfD.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SJ4plDu.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g1WP8F6.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/GtFbRTWy/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NcrK823.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NkAezup.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/D3X10mF.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Caps Best Day After Labor Day\n\n&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.16% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last eight years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last three years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market\u2019s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 42.9% of the time with an average gain of 0.13%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/1422a049f2b0dbca39b1543c5cff0a42/172c7870552d9912-60/s500x750/ff92c03e01c3e886a523a64381a9c44745538da2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big August: Bullish or Bearish?\n\n&gt; Big August 2020 logged the 4th biggest August percent gain for the S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and the 6th biggest since 1930. But, is this bullish or bearish for the market in the coming months? Hopefully the table below provides some perspective by comparing the previous Top 20 S&amp;P 500 Augusts since 1949 to July, September, Q4 and the succeeding \u201cBest Six Months\u201d November-April.\n\n&gt; Subsequent Septembers were down 15 of 20 years for an average loss of -1.0% (median loss of -0.7%). Q4 is positive with gains in 13 of the 20 years for an average gain of 1.0% (median gain of 3.0%). The following Best Six Months are more bullish, up 16 of the 20 years with an average gain of 7.6% (median gain of 8.5%).\n\n&gt; Looking at just the 7 years that were preceded by big Julys shows some improvement for September but Q4s are worse, containing the largest Q4 losses. Back-to-back big Julys and big Augusts were followed by improved Best Six Months results, up in all 7 instances with a higher average and median gain and the top gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7bd7299f2e7714adc709577da928964e/bd54fb998db4a9e1-46/s1280x1920/3363ff03bfc2dead6e88b387771b6bbad2aafece.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Analyzing the Jobs Report\n\n&gt; The jobs market remains strong, as the August nonfarm payrolls came in at a solid 1.37 million jobs created, right in line with expectations. This was the fourth consecutive month of gains, up 10.6 million over this time frame. In March and April more than 22 million jobs were lost, so we still aren\u2019t quite to half of the jobs recovered though.\n\n&gt; This was the second consecutive month there was a very weak ADP private payrolls number ahead of the monthly jobs report, adding to the worries, but the actual nonfarm payroll number was once again quite solid. Don\u2019t forget, just yesterday we saw initial jobless claims come in at 881,000, the lowest number since the week ending March 14, another improving employment number.\n\n&gt; The big surprise in today\u2019s report though was the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, from 10.2% last month and an expected 9.8%. This was the lowest unemployment rate since 4.4% in March.\n\n&gt; \u201cThis was an impressive report and once again showed the economy remained quite resilient,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut 8% unemployment is 8% unemployment, so let\u2019s not get too excited, but we\u2019ll still take this improving trend in the employment picture.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, even though more than 10 million jobs have been created in the past four months, the sad truth is we are still quite a long way from recovering all the jobs lost due to the pandemic. In fact, looking at previous cycles, it has taken years for all of the lost jobs to come back and this time doesn\u2019t appear any different.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; One thing to consider is could this solid number make it harder for Washington to agree on the next stimulus plan? We are watching this closely, but with the two sides still close to a trillion dollars apart, today\u2019s report will likely do little to help the two sides come to a quick resolution.\n\n&gt; Last, don\u2019t forget that stocks gained more than 60% in less than six months, so some weakness would be perfectly normal. In fact, looking at the two previous strongest starts to a bull market ever (\u201982 and \u201909) both saw some weakness right around now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 Charts To Watch If You Are Bullish\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index just closed the door on its best August since 1986, making new all-time highs along the way, while also closing up five months in a row.\n\n&gt; First things first, make no mistake about it; this is a new bull market. That of course doesn\u2019t mean it will last years like previous bull markets, but a nearly 57% gain in 5 months is what we\u2019d classify as a bull market.\n\n&gt; Here are all the bull markets going back to the Great Depression and where this one ranks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Now let\u2019s dig into the 5 month win streak. It is quite rare for stocks to gain from April through August, as the summer months tend to be somewhat tricky. Yet, we found there were six other years that saw these 5 months all close higher and the rest of the year was higher five times, with some solid returns in there. In fact, the only year that was lower the rest of the year was 2018, mainly due to the Fed policy mistake in December 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhat might surprise many investors is 5 month win streaks are actually incredibly bullish going forward,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, a year after a 5 month win streak has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher 25 of the past 26 times.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained more than 35% during this 5 month win streak, the most ever. Yet, the future gains after 5 month win streaks is very impressive, higher 25 out of 26 times a year later. An object in motion tends to stay in motion and this sure seems to be the case here.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year\n\n&gt; What a month August has been so far, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 7%, for the best August since 1984. Not to be outdone, this is the first time in history August saw two separate 6-day (or more) win streaks. Last, with one day to go, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16 days so far this month, for the most since 16 in April 2019. Meanwhile, it is the most up days for any August since 2003.\n\n&gt; \u201cWell, 2020 has laughed at many of these things, but be aware September is indeed the worst month of the year on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut what caught our attention was both September and October have a negative return during election years, with October the worst month of the year. Could investors get election jitters again in 2020?\u201d\n\n&gt; As show in the LPL Chart of the Day, September tends to be a weak month. In fact, it is the weakest month on average since 1950.

        "selftext": "Hey there friends. I know we all have different risk tolerance and my new strategy is definitely riskier but it is working pretty well this week. \n\nMy previous strategy was getting into blue chip ATM or slightly OTM calls with at least 60-90 days to expiration. My reasoning for this was to lower risk and also because of the recent bull market it worked pretty well for a while. \n\nHowever these past few weeks I got totally screwed on some long AAPL calls and sold for a major loss. I repositioned into some AAPL  January 2021 $110c and $115c but had some money left over so I have done 3 day trades this week on smaller companies expecting obvious growth. \n\nI did a day trade on DFS, GME, and DKNG. All 3 of these I set a stop loss of 15% right after, and tried to pull out at a reasonable profit (10-30%). \n\nI like to say I got lucky but I did some pretty quick research on all of these by browsing stock subreddits and then Googling around. A mix of both luck and following sentiment.  \n\nOn all three of those trades I made a decent profit of 10-30%. I missed out on the full potential by selling \"early\" as well as only putting a few hundred dollars on each (max was DFS $880 &gt; $1,000), but a profit is a profit. On those three day trades I'm up $200. \n\nI'm considering waiting for the next very likely short play when my daytrades reset, and doing the same thing with a lot more money. I have about $2k I can put on the line at this point, so I figure if I do another play on a likely upswing like DKNG with the goal of entering and exiting for quick profit, it coule be an okay strategy for making money. \n\nI know this is like trying to predict the future, and I can get burned, but with the 15% stop loss the most I'm risking would be $300 on a $2k play. \n\nIn all my other strategies Ive tried, I end up holding longer and sometimes I miss out on a good profit because I'm holding in hopes for a bigger profit and sometimes it's just a slow bleed like AAPL. A quick day trade seems like the least mentally taxing anyway. \n\nThoughts?",
