I used trading 212\u2019s PIE features which allows me to make my own say mini ETF. I made one using space stocks I knew as well as researching online and ARK\u2019s space ETF.\n\nI\u2019ve listed below the stocks I\u2019m in and what % and so far I\u2019ve been given 15% returns on my investment which i can\u2019t complain about. I was wondering if anyone has feedback on Space stocks to add/remove or adjusting my % per stock. I personally really believe this collection will be very valuable in 10+ years \n\nVirgin Galactic - 10%\nLockheed Martin - 10%\nIridium communications - 10%\nTrimble - 10%\nAerojet Rocketdybe 10%\nMaxar Technologies - 9%\nNorthrop Grumman - 9%\nL3 harris - 8%\nThales - 6%\nBoeing - 5%\nAirbus - 4%\nTeradyne - 3.5%\nDassault systems 3.3%\nRaven industries 2.2%",
