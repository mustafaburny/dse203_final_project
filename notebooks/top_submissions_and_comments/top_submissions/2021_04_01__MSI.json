        "selftext": "The user u/rivaaal posted blackberry patent sale potential based on discounted cash flow using current patent rev. The user doesn\u2019t understand that blackberry hasn\u2019t monetized all their patents, they are in process and so potentially it could be $1bil rev a year. Ceo said they plan to sell majority of their portfolio. Meaning about 25k patents. In past when Motorola aol Kodak sold their patents it fetched about 10bil for less than 10k patents. Blackberry patents are critical in messaging and wireless networking. Currently about 2k companies infringe on these patents that blackberry hasn\u2019t approached, including google and apple. \n\nMy DD based on historical sales of patents and importance of them to messaging leads me to a number that\u2019s between $10-15 billion. \n\nMy final number is about $12 billion for patents. They will sell 25k patents. \n\nPotential buyer is Facebook or google or apple.",
