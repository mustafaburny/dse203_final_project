        "selftext": "First off. Am I going to blindly believe my analysis because I'm bag holding these calls? Yes. Yes I am. \n\nThere's something I've noticed during the last few months as it applies to squeezes/non fundamental price actions in the positive variety. Obviously one is consolidating volume. But almost every single movement was preceded a day or two by a lower than average short volume ratio.\n\nSome tickers I cannot mention, but let's say there was BIG movement in some. At er moment I can't think of another, and my SPiRiT won't let me say the last. But also known ones like CLOV, NEGG, and WKHS. For instance CLOV was riding in the 30s-40s until it dropped to 18 just a couple days before its peak. WKHS went from the 60s to 38 with just two days preceding its peak. And NEGG dropped by half the day before it took off. Are there large price movements that don't have this trend? Yes. So take this with a grain of salt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SDC Short Volume Ratio.](https://preview.redd.it/rv8kt6v0sbp71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93ddd68a65e2465a471aaf02aabf994f6f492eb4)\n\nBefore SDC's run from $5.15 to a high of $7.42 the short volume ratio dropped off. We have a similar setup yesterday and today, where the short volume dropped off again.\n\nTo compare to the latest \"squeeze\" stock, here is one that shows the same below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[at ter moment I cannot say which one this is.](https://preview.redd.it/5ji7kufttbp71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10e853179b6842e49864d98edc352b03161f8abf)\n\nThis stock had two big moves, in which the day preceding the upwards movements had a lower than average short volume ratio. \n\nI'm currently at work, but on my laptop at home I have these same charts for NEGG and CLOV, I'll post them when I get home. \n\nMy thought process is **one**, they know covering is about to start. So why short it now, when you can short it at it's peak. Both making bank, as well as killing the momentum by stop loss hunting. **Two**, it's just too risky to short, or no more shorts to use.\n\nThere is currently plenty of shares to short with, which they did not use on this red day. My belief, there's about to be a pop and they are waiting.\n\nThey could also be waiting to see some price action from hedging calls. I am not an expert on anything, let alone options. There are a crap ton of $6.50 - $8 calls. This ramp up would be the perfect time to short. Especially if your buds at the MM's tell you no one exercised, or when they are done hedging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SDC Calls](https://preview.redd.it/j1jmew5gvbp71.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e476126e83e370d673a762d3c8fc947a6c755605)\n\nTL;DR: Some of the most recent \"squeezes\" were preceded by the same short volume ratio phenomenon that SDC is currently experiencing  \n\nHolding, ehem, retardedly holding, 200 x 9/24 7c, 250 x 10/1 12c, 50 x 10/1 8c, 200 x 10/8 10c, 200 x 10/15 10c, 200 x 10/15 8c",
