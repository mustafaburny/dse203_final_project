        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I\u2019m calling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What\u2019s the good news over the weekend? That they\u2019re going to pass this bill? That\u2019s already in the price.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dk1sp8x.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWQf6mH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wFeS0Wl.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaOFyrX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSJc4XK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Uu8KEZz.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NAgyg9J.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QWK8jnB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LJgR6Qi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3ihOUVn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LM2t3xD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0OcCxG9.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Bottom\n\n&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. \u201cNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 20th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoOzzG6Qk28))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.22.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=744D8neX74s))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday. Here is your stock market news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Wednesday, March 25th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-25-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I\u2019m calling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What\u2019s the good news over the weekend? That they\u2019re going to pass this bill? That\u2019s already in the price.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dk1sp8x.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWQf6mH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wFeS0Wl.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaOFyrX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSJc4XK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Uu8KEZz.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NAgyg9J.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QWK8jnB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LJgR6Qi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3ihOUVn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LM2t3xD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0OcCxG9.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Bottom\n\n&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. \u201cNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I\u2019m calling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What\u2019s the good news over the weekend? That they\u2019re going to pass this bill? That\u2019s already in the price.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dk1sp8x.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWQf6mH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wFeS0Wl.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaOFyrX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSJc4XK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Uu8KEZz.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NAgyg9J.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QWK8jnB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LJgR6Qi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3ihOUVn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LM2t3xD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0OcCxG9.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Bottom\n\n&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. \u201cNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s.

Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I\u2019m calling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What\u2019s the good news over the weekend? That they\u2019re going to pass this bill? That\u2019s already in the price.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dk1sp8x.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWQf6mH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wFeS0Wl.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaOFyrX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSJc4XK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Uu8KEZz.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NAgyg9J.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QWK8jnB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LJgR6Qi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3ihOUVn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LM2t3xD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0OcCxG9.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Bottom\n\n&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. \u201cNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

Here is your stock market news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Wednesday, March 25th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-25-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.

The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday\u2019s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats\u2019 $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at months,\u201d the president said.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said.

Here is your stock market news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, March 24th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-24-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures hit their 5% \u201climit up\u201d levels Tuesday as top Senate and White House officials neared a $2 trillion deal to rescue the economy from the coronavirus crisis. The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday\u2019s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats\u2019 $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at months,\u201d the president said.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said. The carriers and the White House have made no final decisions.Demand for air travel has plummeted as many states have issued formal stay-at-home orders or just encouraged people not to leave their homes. Social-distancing has become the new way of life as the world grapples with containing the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cfaAWsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kH00D11.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/SjUA7ht.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($INFO $LX $AEYE $NEOG $TNP $CMCM $VTSI $YJ $QIWI $ECOR $EH $DMAC $PANL $FENG $CANG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XJRjXat.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/OOVZiVo.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/joftHtT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/irtsavz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/AIITRE6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/RlkMxl6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/trFFJU3.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/MxOAol4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BgKOWeP.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* NVAX\n* ZM\n* NFLX\n* PENN\n* NUGT\n* MAIN\n* IVR\n* SCPH\n* NKE\n* BDTX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-chevron-twitter-amazon-mondelez-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Chevron (CVX)** \u2013 Chevron plans to cut capital spending plans for 2020 by 20%, and will suspend its share buyback program.

Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.
