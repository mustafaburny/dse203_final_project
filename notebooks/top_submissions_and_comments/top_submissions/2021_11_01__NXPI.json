If the goal is to strengthen American supply chain, wouldn't Intel be a key part of the plan? Or are these lower technology chips that's not part of Intel's key roadmap?\n\nAlso, what do you guys think of these other companies that's not often mentioned here like STMSTMicroelectronics, Renasas, On Semi, NXP, and Infineon? Are they good investments? Is GFS now a buy?",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 12, 2021**\n\nStocks advanced firmly on Friday, with market participants continuing to balance better-than-expected corporate earnings amid rising inflation. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.75% higher, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.05%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) broke a three day losing streak to finish 0.51% higher. \n\nAs of Friday\u2019s close, the SPY closed the week 0.4% lower following volatility after the release of the October Consumer Price Index. However, after five consecutive weeks of gains, the market remains marginally below previous all-time highs. The QQQ closed the week 0.91% lower, while the DIA closed the week 0.97% lower.\n\nthe Labor Department released the monthly Consumer Price Index, which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September\u2019s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. \n\nThe staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. \n\nWhile a rise in inflation was expected, the pace of the increase surprised to the upside. If the pace of increase is not moderated soon, it carries meaningful implications for corporations, consumers, and the Federal Reserve. As input costs rise, companies will pass the increase in cost to consumers to preserve their bottom line, who will be forced to pay the higher prices. The Fed would then be forced to step in and rise interest rates, which will makes the cost to borrow money more expensive, which means people and companies will likely spend less, leading to a fall in demand for goods and services. A rise in interest rates would particularly hurt high P/E tech stocks that have been flying in the last two years, as these companies rely on borrowing to fund their aggressive expansion.\n\nStill, the Federal Reserve and many economists have reaffirmed that the inflationary pressures are transitory, caused by pandemic-era disruptions in global trade and will eventually ease, albeit while likely settling at a higher level than had been present before the pandemic. \n\nGabriela Santos, Global Market Strategist at JP Morgan, said \u201cInflation should moderate. We\u2019re talking about settling at 2%, 2.5% over the course of the next 12 months. So we're still talking about real wage gains, and that's extremely supportive, certainly of people's livelihoods, but also of consumption and hence the economy overall. We do expect a big re-acceleration in growth starting this quarter and throughout next year, \\[and\\] 5% average growth just over the next three quarters. So we would characterize this not as stagflation, but as reflation. And that difference is, reflation is actually quite good for earnings growth and quite good for the stock market, especially cyclical sectors.\" So far, expectations are that the Fed will step in sometime mid-2022 to raise interest rates.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Rivian (RIVN), which is backed by Ford and Amazon,  continue to be on absolute fire. The company, which is expected to lose $1.28 billion on no more than $1 million in revenue this quarter, now has a market cap of more than $100 billion. For perspective, they are now the fourth largest automaker in the world by market cap. I\u2019m not a stickler for valuation, but this is absolute insanity and unsustainable. The company has not started production and is already priced to perfection, which they are bound to hit a snag with. I don\u2019t think this price is sustainable. \n* The University of Michigan\u2019s closely monitored Consumer Sentiment survey showed the consumer sentiment index decreased to 66.8 from 71.7 in October, missing estimates of 72.5. Waning confidence reflects \u201c an escalating inflation rate and the growing belief among consumers that no effective policies have yet been developed to reduce the damage from surging inflation,\u201d Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement.\n* A Snap (SNAP) investor sued the social media company alleging it downplayed how Apple\u2019s (AAPL) change in privacy would affect revenue. Remember, the stock plummeted 25% after an earnings miss, citing Apple\u2019s changes as hampering ad revenue. \n* After more than a decade of explosive growth, China's Singles' Day, the world's biggest online shopping fest, is losing its gloss and bracing for more modest growth in coming years, hurt by a slower economy and tighter regulatory scrutiny. Alibaba (BABA) said on Friday its sales - or gross merchandise value (GMV) - during the 11 day event grew 8.5%, the slowest rate ever and the first time it came under double-digits growth. \n* The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it rejected an exchange-traded fund from VanEck that would have tracked Bitc\u2026 spot prices directly. This would have stood in contrast to the ProShares ETF (BITO), which was approved and which only tracks futures rather than prices directly.  \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Affirm (AFRM) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $140 to $185 at Overweight. Stock currently around $149\n* Equifax (EFX) target raised by Needham &amp; Co from $295 to $335 at Buy. Stock currently around $280\n* Nice (NICE) with two target raises. Stock currently around $312\n   * Citigroup from $328 to $364 at Outperform\n   * Royal Bank of Canada from $325 to $368 at Outperform\n* NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) target raised by KeyCorp from $250 to $255 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # 2. Social Metaverse Investing\n\nYou know, before formally introducing this writing, I have to admit that there is a particular challenge when it comes to writing this book and that is modifying for correct predictions or fundamental market shifts. This statement existed in the financial technology chapter but makes more sense to move up  here in the technology introduction where we discuss the evolution of social media. That is because the subject of conversation for the next few years will be the metaverse or the third iteration of the internet. This subject of conversation was essentially referenced in this chapter but the information is far more clear now and requires this final edit or revision. So let's begin.\n\nIt likely makes sense to discuss and break down what a social network really is since it is something that has significantly changed human behavior. I like to invest in what I frame as intent-based social media and this is likely a function of my age and relationship with the internet. An intent-based social media platform is a network where the user is likely to use the application as a tool before considering entertainment. In short, social media exists on a spectrum ranging from intention to entertainment. One could see how a platform like TikTok is geared toward entertainment, while a platform like Pinterest is designed for intention. In this spectrum, we find many others in the middle like YouTube, Twitter, or Reddit.\n\nThis spectrum is critical to understand because it governs what kind of algorithms are used to drive the platform. In the case of entertainment-based media, like Instagram or TikTok, the platform seeks to understand the user so that it can fetch content that will entertain them. Entertainment is a highly subjective endeavor which forces the platforms to depend on algorithms to connect users and content. It is the open field form. On the other side, the intent-based platform serves a designed function and relationship with the content creator. For example, we visit Pinterest to create useful ideas, allowing content-creators to focus on the context of the platform. Google indexes websites so that users can portal into a library of website owners and services. Reddit curates loyal communities to drive its information and space.\n\nThe critical element of this spectrum is the complex conversations that drive privacy and security on platforms. Social media is how we interface with the internet and it is what we refer to as the second iteration of the internet. To briefly shift the tone of this conversation, the entertainment platform suffer from misinformation and propaganda driven campaigns. This is a natural consequence of relying on algorithms that depend on short and effective messaging and may ultimately affect intent-based platforms that orbit closer to entertainment, like Reddit or Youtube. They are called Influencers after all. The conversations surrounding privacy ultimately discuss these worst-case scenarios, so they're important to be mindful of historically and forward-looking.\n\nWith this issue highlighted, I would like to admit that one of my prediction about Facebook was correct. It will exist in social media forever, due to most applications using Facebook's software development ecosystems to create websites and applications on any device. This is similar to how Oracle will essentially exist forever as part of the computing world due to its widespread demand for system maintenance and improvements. This is set in stone and Facebook's drive for the metaverse ultimately points to how the leadership behind Facebook understands that social media is a forum that ebbs and flows with the population over time. So let's explore the thinking behind the leading social media platform and why it knows how to navigate and pivot its product over the years and how it lead to Roblox becoming Facebook's primary competitor for the next decade by examining Pinterest so that we can understand what social media truly is as a first generation investor.\n\nA social media platform is a forum. A forum is a place, meeting, or medium where ideas and views on a particular issue can be exchanged. Each forum accomplishes this in its own unique way.  Twitter is fundamentally used to search for what someone is saying, while Pinterest is used to search for ideas. Pinterest is a particularly interesting case due to hundreds of millions of women adopting the platform and achieving what Google+ had failed to accomplish - a social media platform that harnesses the power of search. I believe this is also an interesting examination of how influential women are to the market. One can question if Apple or Google would be as successful as they are without the seismic changes that the American workforce has adapted.\n\nThis spectrum distinction continues be important when investing in internet forums like Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat because an investor would not want to mistake the differences between companies like Home Depot or Walmart. Both organizations exist in the retailing space, but the nature of the business, its incentives, and its customers are worlds apart. So is Pinterest a social media platform, search service, or both? With this in mind, we might begin to see why Facebook implementing a hashtag, Instagram implementation stories, or TikTok implementing streams may be irrelevant when understanding the full potential of a service like Snapchat or Twitter and the wisdoms the drive its growth in the market. Before ever investing in a company you need to discover and completely understand the incentives that drive the customers to return to the product. Without that, you are ultimately gambling in the market and driving through a fog hoping that things will turn out well.\n\nWhat drives a social networking site is a user\u2019s incentive to search or discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is best served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.\n\nThe forum may take on a different medium. Google is used to answer information, Facebook allows us to connect, while online gaming satisfies our needs for adventure. When you examine the nature of a forum and a user\u2019s incentive to participate in that forum, you\u2019ll come to understand why a applications like Twitter, Pinterest, or online games like Roblox are a force of nature. These forums engage and fulfill our very real needs and demands as social beings. It will also help you understand why companies like Facebook would endeavor in metaverse products like virtual reality games and other forms of social media.\n\nPinterest is closer to the adoption of applications like YouTube or Reddit, where users aren't necessarily sharing their profiles with friends and use the applications to search for information that they find meaningful to them. This is what is known as \u201cpersonal media\u201d rather than typical \u201csocial media\u201d. This is a characteristic that I believe grants a media platform a longer product lifespan. It will also be quite relevant when it comes to conversations about how users interact with the metaverse. Clearly, there will be users that enjoy the extroverted elements of it, while introverted users may prefer the personal media aspects of it. What I try to imagine is that the Instagram \"mall\" may be a more social space than the Pinterest \"mall\" in the metaverse.\n\nThe network-effect that built Pinterest has mostly been driven by women across all social-economic statuses, resulting in profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in is word-of-mouth adoption, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine rather than an application to connect with friends or family. As a result, Pinterest\u2019s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests, which we will touch on shortly.  This has long-term positive consequences for product advertisers regardless of culture - which is exactly why Pinterest is performing remarkably well with international user adoption. Most American customers have already been effectively registered, where nearly 100 million American women are monthly active users.  \n\nThese customers are voluntarily searching for ads. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest\u2019s customers are in a high willingness to engage with things that result in action. In other words, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start, plan, and consume something in the near future. Customers do not need to be influenced into a product when the customer is coming onto the application with completely different expectations and incentives to search and shop. This is effectively a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they\u2019re getting top \"real estate\" advertisements. With a simple search, you\u2019re welcomed to a rich library of consumable ideas for health, gifts, beauty, travelling, home developments, and millions of other regularly marketed products that influence the home.\n\nPinterest users have an incredibly high willingness to engage as a function of using the platform as a power tool. This willingness to engage inevitably translates into a willingness to pay. Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content to discover random nuggets of entertainment. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy outside of Pinterest so that the customer develops a positive relationship with the tool. That is fundamentally different from Facebook\u2019s connect-everything approach to social-networking. It is less wasteful and more effective.\n\nYou may wonder why Pinterest essentially dominates the Google Images real estate when searching for images. This is a pretty complicated question to answer since the search engine optimization market is relatively new. As a rule of thumb, try to imagine that Google Search is more or less \"the web\", where website links are the lifeblood to Google search. A good link is extremely valuable to Google.\n\nDue to this relationship, it is in Google's interest to attempt to create a system that best serves their customer by offering the best, fastest, and most well-rounded results. This means that the most utilized or most well-developed websites are often the top results in a Google search.  This partially explains why searching for \"Lebron James\" today will result in search results by websites like Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, and other supersites.  Similarly, searching for \"Vegan food near me\" will produce results by organizations like Yelp and Doordash.\n\nThere are many other reasons of course, but this is a rough rule of thumb; the more well-developed a website is, the more likely that it will dominate web search results. As the web progresses, the definition of well-developed changes. An example of this is that Google begins to rank and prefer websites that implement privacy, page-load speed, and other important internet accessibility practices. This benefits organizations like Pinterest who develop tools like in-app browsers and support integration with applications like Zoom, Etsy, Shopify, and other large-scale platforms.\n\nWhy is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor and global leader of the internet. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet\u2019s development to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately the access to information, which is as statistically scarce as the access to clean water and sanitation around the globe. In this regard, Google and Facebook compete rather aggressively.\n\nI totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life and scale as one of the most valuable internet properties similar to how Roblox breeched the family household and maintained relevancy over the years. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest and things like Roblox are a reliable and effective advertising space.\n\nI use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I regularly seek to delete it. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest, I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. And Facebook is pivoting itself to exist in such a way that it is impossible to delete. That, to me, is incredible.",
