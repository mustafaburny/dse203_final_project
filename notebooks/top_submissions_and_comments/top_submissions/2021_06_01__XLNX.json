        "selftext": "Hello everyone, \n\nI believe that $AMD is on the verge of experiencing a catalyst that will push the stock to a new ATH. As many of us know $AMD has been trading sideways and down for the past year (with some noise) since last October. I feel fairly certain that that is about to change.\n\nLast October $AMD announced a merger with $XLNX. The two giant companies have been working it out since that time. Recently, both companies share holders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger. \n\nTo summarize what this merger means to $AMD we're talking about increased revenue, increased profit margin, better synergy and heading towards better products. The number 1 thing $AMD is going to get out of this? A better shot at taking down $INTC for the cloud market. A company with a market cap of roughly 225 billion compared to $AMD's 100 billion. So this is a David vs Goliath moment.\n\nThere's plenty of articles written out there on how this changes the financials and prospects for $AMD but I know you guys aren't going to read it if I re-write it here. To put it simply: This is a big deal. If you felt bad about missing $NVDA's stocksplit run, this is the potential chance of catching the 'next' big chip manf. movement.\n\nSo why am I writing this now instead of last October? Well, it's because things changed last week. We know who the customer is now: $GOOG.\n\nThat's right. A 1.67T company is taping $AMD over intel to help support their cloud.\n\nProof: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm\\_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm\\_medium=feed&amp;utm\\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article)\n\nSo we know they picked up $XLNX. Now we know they are teeing up for $GOOG. This is freaking huge. Not to mention they also acquired business from $TSLA, another 600B+ company. \n\nProof: [https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/](https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/)\n\nSo, let's list them out...\n\nCatalysts:\n\n1. $XLNX Merger\n2. $TSLA contract\n3. $GOOG partnership\n\nThis is clearly a big picture strategy on $AMD's part to push $INTC's weakening cloud business straight into the grave and take it's spot. I believe if $AMD is succcessful they will eventually reach a valuation closer to 200-300 billion dollars within the next 1-2 years. That's a 200-300$ share price. \n\nSo what am I suggesting?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I believe that post merger the fair value of $AMD is closer to 120-160 a share\n2. Without the merger $AMD has a value of about 120 a share                                                             \n(due to new contracts and overall market conditions. Just look at $NVDA's recent 50% run. Staying neck to neck as a competitor puts them at 120. But they have new business to justify it instead of black magic stock splits)\n\nIs there TA to support this? You bet there is. I use 2D time frames to wash out noise. I made some small crayon circles to give the picture some scope. You can use a 1W time frame and the analysis is the same. The stock's slow moving averages have begun to move higher and are approaching a cross, moving the stock towards positive. In simple terms: Gaining share value on average, every 2 days. And that rate is growing. The OBV is increasing meaning that **someone** 'aka Wall Street' is secretly scooping up shares and holding onto them. They are doing all of this while keeping the stock suppressed well below it's ATH. I believe they are intentionally gathering as much as they can before the catalysts combine and create a giant bull run. This is a long term run that could make a lot of people rich. The moment when $AMD sprints after $INTC and $NVDA. We all know as gamers and redditors that $AMD has become much much stronger and better in recent years. It's been amazing to watch their progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$AMD 2D time Frame](https://preview.redd.it/ueoex1s30q671.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cae96daec77945f519f2c1a112456ec06399e2b3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere on the 1 week you can see the faintest flicker of bullish life. This is due to the recent contract developments and the quickly approaching date of the merger. As I wrote above, **the catalyst is incoming**.\n\n[1 week time frame](https://preview.redd.it/9f80a7ur0q671.jpg?width=2440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31722579984b09e8fa30bcf913e22b2d41a96c5c)\n\nSo. When is the merger? I am sure you want some dates and some juicy possible plays. Here you go...\n\nWe've got 3 approvals that have to happen. \n\n1. EU - Believed to have no problems and will probably be approved end of June, end of July at the latest.\n2. UK - July 6th Deadline. Also rumored to have 0 problems\n3. CCP - This one there's no rumored date, but CCP supposedly has no issues as well.\n\nWhat is Wall Street doing? They are both shorting the stock while sweeping July calls as well as 2 year leaps. Take a look at July:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou've got 19498 calls purchased for July 16th at a 90$ strike. That sure sounds like Wall Street betting on it hitting 90$... after something happens. But we know what that is. It's the merger. \n\n[Unusual Option Chain July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/s3ez29jl2q671.jpg?width=942&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae8892e1f6a9a53eef3d2dc7a56f57c5a60926be)\n\nHow is this unusual? Take a look at the week prior:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[You could sum this up and it's barely even the volume for the 90$ strike on July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/53uatc9r2q671.jpg?width=944&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42bc7cd9650553fe2f3f34107f10c29c8a5e7ad6)\n\nSo how to interpret this? Well, I read this as Wall Street ***knowing*** what's about to happen. I believe they know the status of the merger, and approximately how far it's going to take the stock. I believe we're looking at $AMD pushing above 90$ by Mid July. This is a potential 10 bagger. Especially with them trying to push down $AMD's price today, now is a good opportunity to get in.\n\nSo what's the play? The easiest one is the 7/16/21 90$ strike. Go alongside wall Street and when you're happy with the profit--sell it. The merger could be announced any day so buying to at least that date is wise (IMO -- but I am just a degenerate not a financial expert). \n\nBuying longer could potentially let you capture more of the run if things play out the way I think it will. You could also take advantage of the current low to grab leaps and sit back and watch how this story unfolds over the next 2 years. Either way, there's real potential here in something most people are considering dead in the water.\n\nI am currently holding 119 contracts. A large portion are for the 7/16/21 90$. So yes, my money is on this play and continues to be what I pursue. This is my YOLO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy recommendations: Buy shares, Buy calls for mid july. Buy leaps. If you buy shares wait for the catalyst to occur. When it reaches an apex, start selling $CCs because the IV is going to grow. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I am not a financial expert. I am just a retail stock trader. I love to do TA as a hobby. I truly believe that $AMD is being suppressed as Wall Street 'fattens' their positions. You know what I say? Fuck 'em. They think they are hiding what they are doing but I definitely see it. They are preparing and we can too. And, if we're right, we can make more than them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck out there. I hope you enjoyed my DD. I don't post DD often on WSB, but I hope y'all enjoyed the read. You guys are great and I love you all.",

        "selftext": "AMD's latest financial reports blew all estimates out of the water... and their latest guidance for 50% growth (up from 37%) is conservative. Here is why:\n\nFUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT\n\nIn a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.\n\nAs  confirmed by both TESLA and AMD recently, the latest Model X and S will  bring AMD silicon (GPU &amp; APU). This is HUGE, because this feature  will eventually trickle down as an optional to the Model 3 and rest of  the Tesla fleet. Why is this important? Just listen to Elon Musk drool  over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)\n\nBut that IS NOT ALL, as Valve will be launching a new portable handheld. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)\n\nIn essence PS4, PS5, XBOX X &amp; S and Valve are all going FULL AMD.\n\nWho do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?\n\nENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it.\n\nThis  is also HUGE as entertainment software will be tailored to AMD's  processing pipeline. Unreal Engine 5 is the perfect example, which  ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).\n\n[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - Nvidia RTX3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/eruzko9mwy471.jpg?width=1289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcbb478a1bcc940bd8c564b5d6b6ace551aa401)\n\n(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)\n\nUnreal  Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing a thing of the past.  This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination,  making it available for non-RTX hardware.\n\nIn  addition, enthusiasts are really pumped with AMD's latest presentation  at Computex, where they presented Fidelity FX SuperResolution. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K.  And the kicker is that this solution will be available to ALL.\n\nIntel's  Raja Koduri (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already  confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FX SR (as per his twitter  post days ago): [https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSo yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING.\n\nBut on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.\n\nIt has made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading in the low $70's.\n\nJust imagine that AMD is trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B\n\nNvidia is trading at a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).\n\nBut when you look at the financials, the differences shrink.\n\nOn Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.\n\nHow does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? It just doesn't.\n\nIf AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \\* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.\n\nAt $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STLL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).\n\nThink about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.\n\nThe reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.\n\nThe Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!\n\nTo summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.\n\nThe new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony.\n\nJust imagine Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property. Fuel the rockets!!!\n\nREMEMBER: In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!\n\nThe MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!\n\nMARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!\n\n..... ALL ABOARD!!!!",

Dr. Lisa Su is still thumbs up!\n\nRecent events provide a **HIGH degree of certainty** that AMD\u2019s **MISSION will be successful**.\n\nNamely:\n\n**1- AMD Genoa (Zen 4) to have 128 cores (256 threads) winning the DATACENTER (INTEL admits)**\n\nAMD was already taking market share from Intel in the datacenter, but the latest leak (from the reputable Jim of AdoredTV / **HE's BACK!!!**) has Intel\u2019s own internal presentations **admitting AMD will EXTEND the LEAD** in the Datacenter (screenshot below).\n\n[Leak from the reputable Jim of AdoredTV - The Scottish king is BACK!!!](https://preview.redd.it/aajw3pq5bw571.jpg?width=1299&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3bcd4f06a39c9bdae4c233fe7fb2e2c1ee81d1a)\n\nWatch his latest video analysis here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNs432VgxmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNs432VgxmQ)\n\nHis confirmation tweet here: [https://twitter.com/AdoredTV/status/1405161144843739148](https://twitter.com/AdoredTV/status/1405161144843739148)\n\nIn  essence, one should expect that if core count is going up for Zen 4  (from 64 to 128), at the VERY least, consumer chips will go from 16 to  24. Furthermore, Threadripper **Zen 4 will be a BEAST**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2- AMD 6900XTX LC (liquid cooled) spotted.**\n\nAMD already achieved the #1 World RECORD in FireStrike last month, breaking 3300MHz in a 6900XT.\n\n[https://www.techpowerup.com/282216/radeon-rx-6900-xt-overclocked-to-3321mhz-breaks-firestrike-world-record](https://www.techpowerup.com/282216/radeon-rx-6900-xt-overclocked-to-3321mhz-breaks-firestrike-world-record)\n\nHowever,  that is NOT their BEST chip. Thanks to better bins, there\u2019s the 6900  XTX which is liquid cooled, with faster memory, higher clock speeds and higher TDP. **A MONSTER!!!**\n\n[Latest super bin model spotted 6900XTX... a RECORD BREAKER for sure!!!](https://preview.redd.it/74prhnfabw571.jpg?width=1154&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02bc05241e25485be5db87fa98c24ed94ce5a290)\n\nThis new model is expected to **BREAK ALL GPU** **WORLD RECORDS** once again.\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xtx-reappears-in-a-custom-pc-as-rx-6900-xt-lc](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xtx-reappears-in-a-custom-pc-as-rx-6900-xt-lc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3- AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution to launch with 44 game developers.**\n\nLatest leak from Vegeta (@Broly\\_X1) published by videocardz.com has AMD launching FX SR on 7 games **next Tuesday**,  with 12 games coming SOON and 44 game studios CONFIRMING to support  AMD's FX Super Resolution (Capcom, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Warner  Bros., Valve, etc.).\n\nThis is **AMAZING** news.\n\nIn essence, ADOPTION is **already a SUCCESS**. Software developers will push AMD FX SR to GPUs, APUs, Consoles and mobile phones (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S22).\n\n[44 developers already backing AMD FX Super Resolution!!!](https://preview.redd.it/lufh7pwfbw571.png?width=1309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af3cb2219e4ca6071d681d04fc24db0633db79a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4- Xilinx acquisition update: UK regulator to respond within 3 weeks.**\n\nThe  Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of the UK is planned to provide  a phase 1 decision on July 6th in connection to AMD\u2019s acquisition of  Xilinx.\n\n[https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/advanced-micro-devices-inc-slash-xilinx-inc-merger-inquiry](https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/advanced-micro-devices-inc-slash-xilinx-inc-merger-inquiry)\n\nAs per Jim Cramer\u2019s Mad Money Lighting Round **YESTERDAY** (see video below) he expects the acquisition to trigger the stock to breakout and keep soaring.\n\nWatch video here: [https://youtu.be/QT5YDHmDpGk?t=140](https://youtu.be/QT5YDHmDpGk?t=140)\n\n[YESTERDAY - Jim Cramer confirms expectation AMD to SOAR after Xilinx](https://preview.redd.it/7kj8xnfjbw571.jpg?width=1272&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f87b2c5ebce97700f0b35c488154ac25334821f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5- AMD AM5 platform to launch Mid-2022 (3D cache CPU\u2019s by end of 2021):**\n\nAs reported by RedGamingTech, AM5 is expected in Q2 and AM4 B660 in Q1.\n\n[https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195](https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195)\n\nIn  essence, the AM4 will be the most successful platform in modern desktop  consumer history, with a new chip coming, with up to 15% performance  BOOST vs. AMD's AMAZING Zen 3 (5000 series).\n\nBut THAT'S NOT ALL, as in Mid-2022 Zen 4 is expected. With higher IPC, in the 5nm process, DD5 memory support and MORE CORES!!!\n\n**To recap:**\n\nAMD to continue **LEADING** the DATACENTER: **Check - all systems go!**\n\nAMD to break more records with new GPU launch: **Check - all systems go!**\n\nAMD to successfully deploy FX Super Resolution Software: **Check \u2013 all systems go!**\n\nAMD to continue soaring with Xilinx: **Check \u2013 all systems go!**\n\nAMD upcoming launch on track: **Check \u2013 all systems go!**\n\n# Stock was up today 5.55% as we continue ACCELERATING!\n\n# Guys.... prepare for a BREAKOUT warp jump!!!",

At a glance it may seem like so what?

He has to set the stage for investors to buy Intel for the future potential in Fab because he knows soon they will drop the stock like hot garbage as AMD takes away not some but the majority of the high end computing revenue.\n\nI personally believe between Data Center, GPU, Notebook, Desktop, Consoles, Cell Phone, Automotive and 5G $AMD will be $300-$400 in the next few years.

        "selftext": "AMD is the best run simi company in the world right now.\n\n[Su Bae](https://i.redd.it/dvg5sf39rg471.gif)\n\nAMD stock is being held down by Arbitrage trading due to the all-stock fixed-ratio Xilinx acquisition. Once that acquisition is approved by world regulators, arbitrage will stop and the stock will soar. Note that the acquisition doesn't have to close, it just needs to be approved for the Arbitrage to stop. Once Arbitrage stops, all of the short selling which is holding AMD stock down will stop, and AMD will rocket towards it's price targets between $106-135\n\n**Arbitrage effect on stocks**  \n In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the price difference. The short selling pushes the price of AMD down, continually, until the arbitrage stops. \n\nRead more on AMD Merger Arbitrage here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd\\_an\\_explanation\\_on\\_merger\\_arbitrage\\_and\\_how\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/)\n\nArbitrage will end when the share ratio between XLNX stock and AMD stock is equal, where there's no difference to be gained. Right now the share ratio difference is \\~1.57 or about 10%. The 10% difference is there for the chance that the acquisition does not go through. Once world regulators approve it though, the chance of acquisition is basically 100% and the share ratio difference will be 0. With no difference, the arbitrage trading and short selling stops and the stock rises. In the case of AMD, the average price target is some 30% over today's prices, so it should rocket.\n\n[https:\\/\\/public.tableau.com\\/app\\/profile\\/upndown\\/viz\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\\_16114624177710\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://preview.redd.it/gr9sro1mqg471.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fc21af702904945f5aa76ae8d7d85c1be4c3a84)\n\n**Possibility of Arbitrage ending soon**  \nCEO Dr. Lisa Su has said many times that the acquisition will close by the end of the year. She's also always conservative in her estimates. Remember that she said revenue would increase by 37% in 2021, only to revise it in Q2 to 50% growth. Su, you sly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ligcuvdksg471.gif\n\nYou can track the regulatory approval status over here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory\\_approval\\_status/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory_approval_status/)\n\nThe US has already approved and Phase 1 of the approval process for the UK and EU will end on July 6th. If there are no objections, the acquisition is approved from them as well. There are not expected to be any objections. If there were any, they would go into Phase 2, which would end at the end of the year (Lisa's conservative timeline).\n\nThe big question is when will China approve? They're the last ones to give the approval. Well no one really knows when this is going to happen. In Oct. of 2020 AMD said they would be drafting a notification to SAMR (China). But that's really the last we heard of it. \n\nThere's a possibility that China will approve around the same time as the UK and EU, which could be as soon as July 6th. In that case,\n\n[butts](https://preview.redd.it/wsr44v9qlg471.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92b9ec2b60f88b9b5443895e00486e98edfa63ef)\n\nAMD announced on May 19th that it was initiating a $4B stock buyback. And since then it appears that AMD has been buying back it's own stock in big chunks every day around 9:30-10am:\n\n[perdy](https://preview.redd.it/1cmdiz4fng471.png?width=538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1e1174f74f52798ea863caab6172b972d0698b6)\n\nThe doctor is smart. She knows the arb is keeping the stock down and aims to profit from it. The timing of the buyback may suggest that she thinks the approval is going to happen sooner than the end of the year. \n\nEither way, the stock will rocket once the approval happens. Could be in less than a month, if not, then it'll be end of year. Either way we're making tendies, it's just a matter of how soon. Place your bets! (not financial advice)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/e5f3tvr1sg471.gif\n\nPositions: YOLO $50k in AMD stock and call options spread from June 2021 to June 2022",

        "selftext": "Hi\n\n I am a European citizen who started investing last year at the boom of the covid pandemic. I started simply and intuitively at Revolut app and bought several shares of AAL, NCLH and LTMAQ at the huge dip caused by the pandemic and I'm currently +150% on each of them. Unfortunately LTMAQ was removed from the NYSE to OTM and now Revolut only allows the sale of shares and nothing else.  Because of this and also the limited number of free trades per month, I decided that I would no longer use the Revolut app for trading. \n\n Then I discovered Trading212, a simple, intuitive and commission-free broker. Here I bought and hold shares of NIO (+102%), PLTR (+20%), CCIV (+6%), AMC (+80%) and PSTH (-8%). Unfortunately Trading212 started to let me down. Friends of mine had shares of Tilray and Apharia and on the day of the merger of the companies, T212 without warning anyone sold their shares of Apharia because it does not support mergers. I wanted to buy shares of AMD and Xilinx but I give up because they don't support mergers and when the acquisition is approved they will sell shares of XILINX without notice.   I'm also disappointed because it doesn't support warrants and so there's a whole complexity around PSTH that they can't tell me how they're going to solve. \n\nThat said, do you know of any brokers for European citizens that have a web and app interface as intuitive and beautiful as the T212 but that know how to deal with these fundamental problems in the daily lives of a retail investor like us?  T212.  Not even transferring the portfolio to another broker, Trading212 supports it, so I would have to sell all my positions, pay taxes on the capital gains and buy everything again on another broker. I would also like to start investing in options in the future, but for that I am thinking of using Tastyworks.   \n   \nSorry for my english skills.  \nBest regards.",

        "selftext": "AMD's latest financial reports blew all estimates out of the water... and their latest guidance for 50% growth (up from 37%) is conservative. Here is why:\n\nFUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT\n\nIn a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.\n\nAs  confirmed by both TESLA and AMD recently, the latest Model X and S will  bring AMD silicon (GPU &amp; APU). This is HUGE, because this feature  will eventually trickle down as an optional to the Model 3 and rest of  the Tesla fleet. Why is this important? Just listen to Elon Musk drool  over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)\n\nBut that IS NOT ALL, as Valve will be launching a new portable handheld. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)\n\nIn essence PS4, PS5, XBOX X &amp; S and Valve are all going FULL AMD.\n\nWho do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?\n\nENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it.\n\nThis  is also HUGE as entertainment software will be tailored to AMD's  processing pipeline. Unreal Engine 5 is the perfect example, which  ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).\n\n[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - NVIDIA RTX 3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/wgykwgfhty471.jpg?width=1289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f2c5a018dfb47c628f1ce1d2650a138e1be0267)\n\n(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)\n\nUnreal  Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing a thing of the past.  This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination,  making it available for non-RTX hardware.\n\nIn  addition, enthusiasts are really pumped with AMD's latest presentation  at Computex, where they presented Fidelity FX SuperResolution. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K.  And the kicker is that this solution will be available to ALL.\n\nIntel's  Raja Koduri (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already  confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FX SR (as per his twitter  post days ago): [https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSo yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING.\n\nBut on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.\n\nIt has made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading in the low $70's.\n\nJust imagine that AMD is trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B\n\nNvidia is trading at a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).\n\nBut when you look at the financials, the differences shrink.\n\nOn Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.\n\nHow does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? It just doesn't.\n\nIf AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \\* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.\n\nAt $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STLL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).\n\nThink about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.\n\nThe reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.\n\nThe Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!\n\nTo summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.\n\nThe new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony.\n\nJust imagine Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property. Fuel the rockets!!!\n\nREMEMBER: In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!\n\nThe MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!\n\nMARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!\n\n..... ALL ABOARD!!!!",
