        "selftext": "My goal with my current holdings is to pick stocks that I can reasonably expect to 4x or 5x over the next five years - there's no way they all will, but enough of them will.

This stabilizes the portfolio through a period that I may want to retain my growth stocks amidst them being a little underwater or lagging i.e. this is the enabler. Portion 2 (11%): \n\nPRU 21%, ALLY 21%, BMO 21%, PNC 21%, AXP 16% \n\n\nA smaller portion of the portfolio is dedicated to low-volatility and drawdown components - save for a few days/events here and there. This allows me to invest as much cash as possible and withdraw it either from that or something else in the portfolio if I suddenly need the money - also if it dips the growth may have dipped more, enabling me to add money to growth stocks. The underperformance of this component is addressed by the growth portion. Portion 3 (9%): \n\nSPY 40%, VYM 17.5%, WMT 12.5%, QYLD 10%, XLRE 10%, NEE 8%\n\nI'm in my low to mid-20s, but I have it so bad with medical issues that there's no way my time horizon is until the age of 50, for I'm not sure how long I can or should live past then when my symptoms will worsen.

        "selftext": "Omg we're selling off lol!  It seems like the sp500 is not holding up as well as the nq.  Is there a reason?\n\nI think all this is healthy though and I've gotten to where I could care less.  I'm tired of always panicking and selling (at loss most of the time) every time CNBC tells us to.  Let me guess.  Tonight they're gonna have on Mohammed El-Erian? Screw em! Even if I lose screw em! I know in 5 years I'll have more money. If not then oh well I'll survive somehow! \n\nI think as long as you hold mostly FANMAG stocks you should be ok for at least the next 5 years and I don't care what anyone says, that's how I feel.  If I end up homeless, then who cares.  In the end we die anyways.  At least I did it my way.\n\nI just really get tired of the CNBC talking heads saying to rotate to this and then rotate back to tech etc etc every other day.  I now just have a balanced portfolio with total market also although I am 50% FANMAG stuff.  Mostly MSFT AAPL (20%), which seem to be holding up ok today.\n\nIn the words of Cramer .... BOTTOM LINE ... Have a balanced portfolio, stop panic selling and trying to time things, select good stocks like MSFT AAPL PYPL GOOGL AMZN LRCX SHW HON UNH some total market, small caps, value and sit back and accept what happens more or less.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 29, 2021**\n\nDespite some volatility earlier in the week, stocks firmly rose today as market participants looked beyond slightly disappointing GDP and jobs data and the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Monetary Policy, which showed no changes but did indicate members are increasingly considering the potential timeline to taper quantitative easing (QE). In my opinion, the fact that markets continue to shrug off volatility to charge higher shows great relative strength and signals that market participants remain willing and able to buy dips. \n\nThe S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both recorded fresh all-time highs, closing 0.4% and 0.42% higher respectively. The Nasdaq (QQQ) is right under its own record high and closed the day 0.18% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed again, closing 0.77% higher.\n\nToday, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advanced estimate of second-quarter gross-domestic-product (GDP) growth. Despite accelerating from the first-quarter, economists were largely expecting a higher jump, despite consumer spending, the largest component of US economic activity, beating expectations. However, it seems market participants were not fazed. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Q2 GDP, seasonally adjusted annualized quarter-over-quarter:** 6.5% vs. 8.4% expected and a downwardly revised 6.3% in Q1\n* **Personal consumption:** 11.8% vs. 10.5% expected and 11.4% in Q1\n* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter:** 6.0% vs. 6.1% expected and an upwardly revised 2.7% in Q1\n\nMarket participants are digesting the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Monetary Policy Report, released yesterday, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The statement read, \u201cLast December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage\u2011backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.\u201d In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. \n\nOn inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, \u201cInflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses\u201d and \u201cThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer\u2011term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\nRead the entire July FOMC statement here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm)\n\nAmazon (AMZN) absolutely smashed earnings, posting probably the most impressive quarter I have ever seen. Despite this, the stock is currently down 5% after some analysts raised concerns about a slowdown in growth moving forward due to reopenings and difficult comparisons. Personally, with numbers like this, I am going to snap up any dip if it continues tomorrow. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Revenue:** $115.06 billion expected versus $88.91 billion in Q2 2020\n* **EPS:** $15.75 expected versus $10.30 in Q2 2020\n* **AWS revenue:** $14.18 billion expected versus $10.81 billion in Q2 2020\n\nIn other news, the Labor Department Weekly Unemployment Report came in higher than expected. Here are the numbers \n\n* **New Jobless Claims:** 400,000 vs 385,000 expected\n* **Continuing Claims:** 3.269 million vs 3.183 million expected\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Yesterday, shares of Facebook (FB), which recently joined the $1 trillion market-cap club, fell after the company warned of a \u201csignificant slowdown\u201d in growth moving forward and suggested that Apple\u2019s (AAPL) newest iOS app-tracking update, which let\u2019s users opt out of having apps track their activity outside their own platform, would negatively impact their core advertising business. Here are the numbers\n   * **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected\\\\\n   * **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts\n   * **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected\n   * **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected\n   * **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected \n* PayPal (PYPL) also reported earnings, which were largely in-line with expectations. As a result, stock fell roughly 5% today. Personally, that move seems a little overdone to me.\n* Today was the highly anticipated IPO of Robinhood (HOOD), popular brokerage that has garnered a horrendous reputation among many retail traders, particularly those who invest in \u201cmeme stocks\u201d. Like I have said before, personally not touching that stock with a 10-foot pole, too many dynamics at play. But it will still be fun to keep track of.\n* President Biden on Thursday called for state and local governments to make $100 payments to every newly vaccinated American as authorities race to stem the newest wave of Covid-19 cases. \n* Trevor Milton, founder and former CEO of Nikola Motors, the truck, hydrogen start-up that turned out to be a fraud, was charged with defrauding investors.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Align Technologies (ALGN) with two target raises.
