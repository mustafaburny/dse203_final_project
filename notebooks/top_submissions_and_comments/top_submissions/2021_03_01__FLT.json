        "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: Please do your own research - no investment is without risk, and may lose value.\n\nMarket Cap = 146M. Share price at close = $7.91\n\nSECTOR: Information Technology, INDUSTRY: Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals\n\nSummary: One Stop Systems, Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets custom **high-speed computing systems** for high-performance edge computing applications in the US and internationally. Its GPU expansion units add hundreds of computing cores and teraflops of computing performance to virtually any original equipment manufacturer server. OSS' flash storage arrays provide hundreds of terabytes of storage and **millions of input/output operations per second** (see applications, below). It also offers servers for PCI express-over-cable expansion; desktop expansion appliances in various configurations that add input/output flexibility to any user's desktop system; **PCIe expansions,** and ruggedized mobile high-performance compute devices to meet specialized requirements for devices deployed at the edge in **various environmental conditions**. One Stop Systems, Inc. was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Escondido, California. \n\nAPPLICATIONS \\- buckle in, exciting stuff.\n\nWith wide-ranging applications like AI, autonomous cars, and military technologies we don't even know exist yet (laser tech, threat detection, missile targeting), \"edge computing\" is sure to expand and meet growing demand for high-performance computing able to provide millions of actionable data points every second. In January 2021, OSS announced their 4th military contract via project \u201cOrange Gear,\u201d an AI system that enables U.S. Navy aircraft to conduct real-time AI-powered threat detection. Shooting down enemy assets, what guides the weapon? OSS enables the second-to-second calculations to achieve such precision. \n\nInteresting fact: OSS chief sales and marketing officer Jim Ison says they are going to \u201cexpand the support of wartime theater applications for [land, sea, air and space](http://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2021/01/05/2153506/0/en/OSS-Wins-Fourth-Program-with-Major-Military-Contractor.html).\u201d ***SPACE***. What an incredible hint of things to come! The final frontier, space exploration represents a vast yet untapped potential area of edge computing expansion. Heck, the previous administration just created a new *branch of the military* specifically for protecting America\u2019s interests above the stratosphere. Also consider that the USA, with a defense budget of $700 billion annually, will likely purchase American-made edge computing tech in-house, avoiding adversaries like China. OSS seems here to stay.\n\nWhile military contracts might not whet your appetite, consider autonomous driving. OSS\u2019 ingenious \u201cAI on the Fly\u201d enables in-vehicle \u201cruggedized\u201d autonomous driving. Here is a company rep, much smarter than myself, excited to provide more detail on [OSS' computing devices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAagBi_j4cA&amp;ab_channel=InsideHPCReport) in self-driving vehicles.\n\nSo what is a PCIe? The PCIe is the motherboard site that interfaces with a computer's graphics cards, hard drive adapter, SSDs, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet hardware connections. In June 2020, OSS introduced the [world\u2019s first](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2051412/0/en/OSS-Introduces-World-s-First-PCIe-Gen-4-Expansion-System-for-NVIDIA-A100-PCIe-GPUs.html#:~:text=(Nasdaq%3A%20OSS)%2C%20a,20X%20over%20the%20previous%20generation) PCIe Gen4 Expansion System that fully supports NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, which can boost computing performance up to 20X over the previous generation. The OSS Gen4 Expansion System allows system developers to scale out almost any Gen4 server by adding up to eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The system is ideal for boosting the performance of compute-intensive applications like **AI training, AI inference, video analytics and XR rendering**. What is XR rendering? X is just a placeholder! Virtual, Mixed, or Augmented reality (VR, MR, or AR, respectively) experiences include those where users generate new forms of reality by bringing digital objects into the physical world and those that see the bringing physical world objects into the digital world. Yes, OSS also powers augmented reality applications.\n\nINDUSTRY - is there growth to \u201cEdge Computing\u201d as a field? \n\n[MarketsandMarkets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/edge-computing-market-133384090.html#:~:text=Edge%20computing%20can%20be%20used,%2C%20healthcare%2C%20and%20many%20others) projects the global edge computing market to grow from **$3.6 billion in 2020 to $15.7 billion by 2025**, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 34.1% during the forecast period. Factors such as the growing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) across industries; rising demand for low-latency processing and real-time, automated decision-making solutions; and a need for surmounting exponentially increasing data volumes and network traffic.\n\nPARTNERSHIPS\n\nOSS is diversified in its partnerships with the big boys - Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, and [many others](https://www.onestopsystems.com/partners).\n\nMEAT AND POTATOES - finances \n\nFollowing IPO in 2018, OSS already generates $60 million in revenue, increasing 45% YOY. \n\nHow about its market share? To find a company\u2019s size, or \u201cmarket cap,\u201d multiply the current share price by the number of shares. OSS clocks in with 16,620,000 shares x $7.91 = 131M. For a company with a 130M market cap, $60M in revenue represents very strong revenue (46%) to its size. For comparison\u2019s sake, NVDA market cap is 335B and generates 16.7B annually (5%). With 31% institutional ownership \u2013 and [increasing](https://fintel.io/so/us/oss) \u2013 this is certainly on the radar of the big players.\n\nA note about earnings per share (EPS) - OSS\u2019 earnings announcement is coming between March 19 and 25. Based on two analyst forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.04 with 12.17M revenue. Indeed, OSS has quickly transformed itself into a profitable enterprise with [consistent revenue beats](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OSS/earnings) to boot. \n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nIn short, OSS has 40M in assets, 11M in liabilities and 2M total debt. \n\n*Processing img 0357jvc0uok61...*\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nFormerly the interim head, now-CEO [David Raun](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/25/2053412/0/en/OSS-Appoints-David-Raun-Technology-Industry-Veteran-as-President-CEO.html) has two decades of experience in the PCIe area, and led PLX Technology to record revenue and profits before getting acquired by Broadcom (AVGO).\n\nCOMPETITORS\n\nForget the stellar partnerships, what about the competition? Within the well-differentiated industry of Hardware, Storage, and Peripherals are 40 companies ranging from Apple to Ricoh. The direct competitor to watch for is Supermicro (SMCI). SMCI, however, makes no mention of cloud-readiness in its press release (coincidentally publicized merely hours after OSS, on the very same day - nervous, perhaps?). \n\nOn the other hand, the OSS 4UV can connect almost any Gen 4 server to eight A100 PCIe GPUs and two NICs, also offering a complete NVIDIA GPU **cloud-ready solution** with the OSS 4UV pre-installed in an OSS 2U-EOS-4a Gen 4 server.\n\nOFFERING\n\nPremarket Tuesday, March 2nd, OSS announced a 1.5M share offering to an institutional investor. Remarkably, OSS showed strength into the mid-morning, after opening at $7.56 it hit a high of $8.79 before succumbing to general market weakness and closing at $7.91, down 11% (see daily chart below). A green candle the day after an offering? Sounds like a great dip to buy. \n\nTECHNICALS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tf412r4quok61.jpg?width=1522&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d061155dc969bb6663af3fd38c9d1014ed799264\n\nVolume has been readily coming in. A stock that previously traded around 40k volume is now averaging big volumes, over 1M+ daily. What happened? I think institutions are beginning to catch on. Currently above the 5, 20, and 50 moving averages, OSS bounced nicely off the 20 MA during a big intra-day rally (40%+) on March 1st, 2021 hitting a fresh 52-week high of $9.50 without apparent news. \n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nInvestors should ask the question, \"where could this company be in 2 to 3 years?\" With OSS, we have a case study in a profitable company meeting big revenue expectations relatively soon after IPO, invaluable partnerships, military contracts, and anticipatory growth in the industry and beyond.\n\nPOSITIONS: I am in for 1300 shares at $8.60.",
