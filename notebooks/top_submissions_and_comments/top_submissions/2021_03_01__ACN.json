        "selftext": "Stocks were mixed on Monday as Treasury yields rose amid stimulus optimism. The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. \n\nOver the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden\u2019s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. \n\nThe prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today\u2019s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. \n\nHighlights\nThe ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.\n\nShares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.\n\nShares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting. As usual, exercise extreme caution around these plays, no one knows what could possibly happen.\n\nRoblox's IPO is set to take place on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol \"RBLX.\" \n\n*Please note that current stock price was written in the morning premarket and does not reflect intraday movement*\n \n\nAccenture (ACN) target raised by Susquehanna from $267 to $290 at Positive.

        "selftext": "Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.\n\n# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.\n*****\n&gt; Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; \u201cThe markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,\u201d said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cI think the message is going to be consistent.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.\n*****\n&gt; Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.\n*****\n&gt; That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.\n*****\n&gt; Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% \u2014 its highest level in more than a year.\n*****\n&gt; It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year \u2014 deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,\u201d said Peters of PGIM.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there\u2019s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.\n*****\n&gt; # Growth vs. cyclicals\n&gt; Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&amp;P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.\n*****\n&gt; Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen rates are very low, valuations don\u2019t matter to people,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf rates are low, there\u2019s no penalty,\u201d he said. \u201cIf rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he\u2019s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe names that I\u2019m in \u2014 Visa, GM, Ford, Macy\u2019s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&amp;P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,\u201d Redler said. \u201cLast week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, \u2018Was that it?\u2019\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,\u201d he said. \u201cRates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday\u2019s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Apple\u2019s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market\u2019s gains last year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWatch Apple because it\u2019s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,\u201d Redler said.\n*****\n&gt; # Bond volatility\n&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including February\u2019s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank\u2019s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.\n*****\n&gt; The program expires March 31.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,\u201d Peters of PGIM said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe markets are kind of divided on what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see these whippy moves.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fkwT5RT.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/MuJ7SlC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lQiMjAN.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/hvH8uj8.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/AUV1ojJ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ojOPNgp.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OtOIN5B.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AUXbpnZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sptpE1X.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hb2eNGo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YPDtJd7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOhfVX4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13\n\n&gt; Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.\n\n&gt; March\u2019s option expiration week performance is second only to December\u2019s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ\u2019s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March\u2019s quarterly options expiration.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6ef1d4cbdd86a8efa09b8c2942d48517/32ed3896b2fe9623-1a/s500x750/f4254e1e0edf858dbfd4e67344757c69c48d30b6.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/81d51a4dd39b5941b831de20b28314c7/32ed3896b2fe9623-0e/s500x750/3ef3515466260a5660a9ec6eadb8a91cd697cf96.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/92b861530dfd9673b236fb0cd7af89c0/32ed3896b2fe9623-3c/s500x750/23c07978c0f660d7070cc8e2dd6c81aa392a92b7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Signs of Life in Europe?\n\n&gt; Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.\n\n&gt; Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&amp;P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While we don\u2019t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. \u201cWe remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.\u201d\n\n&gt; For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market\u2019s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior \u2013 and likely to do so for some time to come.\n\n&gt; There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.\n\n&gt; The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today\u2019s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week\u2019s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.\n\n&gt; This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.\n\n&gt; However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/264401d95b5a55c592a6f8f10df22c5e/24ec511e4e033f88-38/s500x750/fe7be5042338b6e7e7b428a0f8fd5208691e48d7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Versatile Outperformers\n\n&gt; There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&amp;P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing?

        "selftext": "# Summary\n\nAdobe\u2019s powerful position in the professional design and media production ecosystem has given them a valuable foothold in helping their clients get things done. Synergies between Digital Media and Digital Experience will allow Adobe to grow existing accounts as their solutions evolve to support customer operations far beyond creative and marketing.\n\n# Profile\n\nAdobe views its business in two key segments, Digital Media and Digital Experience.\n\nDigital Media (\\~75% of revenue) \u2013 what you probably think of when you hear the name Adobe. Products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share and engage with documents and creative content. Things like Creative Cloud and Document Cloud.\n\nDigital Experience (\\~25% of revenue) \u2013 a comprehensive and integrated platform and set of applications and services through Adobe Experience Cloud that enable brands and businesses of all sizes to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Spoiler: this is where my bull case lies.\n\nIn Adobe\u2019s own words [(Form 10-K)](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/ADBE-10K-FY20-FINAL.pdf):\n\n&gt;*\u201cBy integrating products from each of these areas, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue to invest in delivering digital experiences.\u201d*\n\n# Fundamentals\n\n|Next Earnings Date|March 23rd (no time given)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Market Cap|$213B|\n|Forward P/E|41.02|\n|Shares|479M (Outstanding), 403.5M ( \\~85% Institutionally owned)|\n|Previous Close (3/12)|$444.30|\n|52WK Range|$255.13 - $536.88|\n|Average Volume|2.6M, so liquid enough.|\n|TAM|Adobe considers its TAM to be $147B by 2023|\n|Revenue Expectations|Plans to surpass $15B of revenue in FY21|\n\n**Inside activity** \u2013 only two small sales in the last 3 months that weren\u2019t automatic or scheduled. Net activity is \\~300K shares sold (mostly automatic)\n\n**Buybacks** \u2013 Adobe has accelerated buybacks and recently increased the board\u2019s share buyback authorization to $15B, as their original $8B repurchase is expected to be exhausted by mid-FY21.\n\n# Climate\n\nAdobe has a formidable moat around its Digital Media business segment, with very few competitors to its creative workflow management solutions. With many offices continuing to work virtually, and companies continuing to invest in their creative infrastructure for remote employees, strong growth in Digital Media should continue. **Whether they love or hate it, every creative professional knows they need proficiency in the Creative Cloud suite, and probably a subscription to it too.**\n\nAs Adobe says in their 10-K and [Annual Shareholder letter](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/AdobeStockholderLetter2021.pdf), *\u201cevery business is a digital business, and the imperative for customer experience management has never been more real.\u201d* Organizations and brands of every shape and size are wisely looking to improve their digital presence and customer experiences. Whether it's look and feel, project management tools, or e-commerce buy flow \u2013 Adobe has a solution for it. The pandemic only accelerated the trend, when nearly every opportunity to engage audiences went digital. To that end, the **Digital Experience segment stands to become a larger contributor to future revenue growth.** Adobe will successfully cross-sell Digital Experience solutions to existing Digital Media customers (think e-commerce, marketing and analytics tools, project management tools, etc.).\n\nAdobe will also generate new revenue streams from [recently-announced public sector use cases](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2021/Adobe-Partners-With-All-50-US-States-to-Modernize-Digital-Experiences-for-Citizens/default.aspx). These federal, state, and local government partnerships will serve as lighthouse accounts for future growth within government, [healthcare](https://www.adobe.com/customer-success-stories/walgreens-boots-alliance-case-study.html), and other public impact sectors. These are reliable customers that are reluctant to switch solution providers due to baked-in opex approvals \u2013 which makes a SaaS offering incredibly sticky with large institutions.\n\nWhile we're discussing government and healthcare customers, it's really worth mentioning third party resellers. Again, from the [Form 10-K](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/investor-relations/pdfs/ADBE-10K-FY20-FINAL.pdf):\n\n&gt;*\"We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), systems integrators (SIs), independent software vendors (ISVs), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions.\u201d*\n\nTypical multi-channel, large software company strategy. But these third party solutions providers become incredibly important in highly regulated spaces like government and healthcare. With Adobe's [recent acquisitions](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2020/Adobe-Completes-Acquisition-of-Workfront/default.aspx) and [getting FedRAMP approval in 2019](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2019/09/20/adobe-obtains-new-fedramp-authorizations-enhancing-its-digital-government-services-in-the-cloud.html#gs.vn62be), they\u2019ve shown they\u2019re serious about becoming a bigger government and institutional player. These are highly regulated industries, with long and bureaucratic procurement processes. **Often, government and healthcare buyers are only authorized to do business with a handful of pre-approved vendors.** As Adobe continues to integrate and white-label their Experience products to third party partners, they become an increasingly available, attractive option for customers in highly regulated verticals. Inside these organizations, it\u2019s very difficult for buyers at big enterprise and government customers to win large appropriations approvals (to switch or rebuild systems), and much easier to lock in software solutions as a monthly \"cost of doing business.\" As organizations move to opex models like SaaS, there\u2019s even more stickiness than there used to be.\n\n# Technicals\n\nP/E ratio of \\~41.02 seems high, but looking at Adobe\u2019s closest competitors shows they\u2019re not the highest.\n\n|Autodesk (ADSK)|49.28|\n|:-|:-|\n|PayPal (PYPL)|70.72|\n|Salesforce (CRM)|48.45|\n|DocuSign (DOCU)|N/A|\n|SAP (SAP)|29.92|\n|Accenture (ACN)|32.61|\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to find a direct comparison, but I think Adobe\u2019s marketing, analytics and e-commerce ambitions make their P/E getting closer to Salesforce very plausible. Part of Adobe's strength is that there's nobody that directly competes with them on all fronts.\n\n**Analyst Sentiment** \u2013 solid buy sentiment from 23+ analysts, which has gone mostly unchanged in the last few months. Lowest price target is $500, with the average around $560-$570. I have yet to see a sell rating. ([Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=ADBE))\n\n**Moving Averages and Technical Indicators** \u2013 I\u2019ll let others chime in here, because this is my weakest area of knowledge. From what I can see, monthly moving averages and technical indicators suggest ADBE is a semi-strong buy and slightly oversold, respectively. I expect positive momentum to accelerate due to trading at 6-month lows leading up to earnings, BidenBux coming through, and the market forgetting about the 10yr Treasury Yield. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADBE?p=ADBE))\n\nRemember, this was trading at $500 a month ago. While I think this is worth a long term hold, I also think we'll see it pop when they post yet another earnings beat.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCombined with Adobe\u2019s well-known lock-in for professional design and content production workflows in their Media segment, growing competency in their Experience segment will make Adobe extremely competitive as an end-to-end SaaS provider for public and institutional customers. **Simply put, I believe Adobe\u2019s Digital Experience segment will  grow to be at least half the size of Digital Media, with large enterprise and government partnerships being a sleeping giant in their pipeline.**\n\nPlanning to purchase 4/19 $490c at open tomorrow.",

So it builds a custom product for each of it\u2019s customer which is not repeatable or salable to other customers as the customer paid for the project\n* The business model is not subscription based.

        "selftext": "correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. \n\nOver the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden\u2019s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. \n\nThe prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today\u2019s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. \n\nHighlights\n\nThe ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.\n\nShares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.\n\nShares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.\n\n# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.\n*****\n&gt; Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed ahead\n&gt; \u201cThe markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,\u201d said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cI think the message is going to be consistent.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.\n*****\n&gt; Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.\n*****\n&gt; That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.\n*****\n&gt; Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% \u2014 its highest level in more than a year.\n*****\n&gt; It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year \u2014 deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,\u201d said Peters of PGIM.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there\u2019s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.\n*****\n&gt; # Growth vs. cyclicals\n&gt; Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&amp;P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.\n*****\n&gt; Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen rates are very low, valuations don\u2019t matter to people,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf rates are low, there\u2019s no penalty,\u201d he said. \u201cIf rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he\u2019s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe names that I\u2019m in \u2014 Visa, GM, Ford, Macy\u2019s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&amp;P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,\u201d Redler said. \u201cLast week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, \u2018Was that it?\u2019\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,\u201d he said. \u201cRates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday\u2019s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Apple\u2019s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market\u2019s gains last year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWatch Apple because it\u2019s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,\u201d Redler said.\n*****\n&gt; # Bond volatility\n&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including February\u2019s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank\u2019s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.\n*****\n&gt; The program expires March 31.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,\u201d Peters of PGIM said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe markets are kind of divided on what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see these whippy moves.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fkwT5RT.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/MuJ7SlC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lQiMjAN.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/hvH8uj8.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/AUV1ojJ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ojOPNgp.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OtOIN5B.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AUXbpnZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sptpE1X.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hb2eNGo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YPDtJd7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOhfVX4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13\n\n&gt; Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.\n\n&gt; March\u2019s option expiration week performance is second only to December\u2019s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ\u2019s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March\u2019s quarterly options expiration.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6ef1d4cbdd86a8efa09b8c2942d48517/32ed3896b2fe9623-1a/s500x750/f4254e1e0edf858dbfd4e67344757c69c48d30b6.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/81d51a4dd39b5941b831de20b28314c7/32ed3896b2fe9623-0e/s500x750/3ef3515466260a5660a9ec6eadb8a91cd697cf96.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/92b861530dfd9673b236fb0cd7af89c0/32ed3896b2fe9623-3c/s500x750/23c07978c0f660d7070cc8e2dd6c81aa392a92b7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Signs of Life in Europe?\n\n&gt; Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.\n\n&gt; Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&amp;P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While we don\u2019t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. \u201cWe remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.\u201d\n\n&gt; For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market\u2019s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior \u2013 and likely to do so for some time to come.\n\n&gt; There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.\n\n&gt; The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today\u2019s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week\u2019s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.\n\n&gt; This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.\n\n&gt; However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/264401d95b5a55c592a6f8f10df22c5e/24ec511e4e033f88-38/s500x750/fe7be5042338b6e7e7b428a0f8fd5208691e48d7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Versatile Outperformers\n\n&gt; There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&amp;P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308a-768x515.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308b-768x509.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308c-768x253.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fg64QYPl48))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ttI9inNJ90))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$CRWD** \n&gt; * **$SNDL** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$GEVO** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$VFF** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$VUZI** \n&gt; * **$PDD** \n&gt; * **$HEXO** \n&gt; * **$NFE** \n&gt; * **$RESN** \n&gt; * **$CRBP** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$DM** \n&gt; * **$WPRT** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$QFIN** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$AGEN** \n&gt; * **$ACRX** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$PD** \n&gt; * **$FLNT** \n&gt; * **$WSM** \n&gt; * **$AOUT** \n&gt; * **$FUTU** \n&gt; * **$CTAS** \n&gt; * **$BL** \n&gt; * **$FTEK** \n&gt; * **$ACEL** \n&gt; * **$SIC** \n&gt; * **$BEKE** \n&gt; * **$MP** \n&gt; * **$WB** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$RDHL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfVfqx2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Is3mMmC.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k2c0t0O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/VKvrx46.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  3.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eoFBwOW.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ujRMr7q.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/myM4TrG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jVQLr1k.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AWKlUdJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWuSo8l.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VyDOWFI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $270.20\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MicroVision: $150 stock when acquired for $20 Billion?**\n\nI can\u2019t tell you what people expect from the 4th Qtr CC, but I wouldn't look for an announcement that the company was sold. I wouldn\u2019t look for an announcement that someone took an equity stake. I wouldn't look for an announcement that Lidar A-Sample is already done. In my opinion these are not realistic expectations and may not happen at the 4th Qtr Earnings CC.\n\nHowever, I would look for an update on all of the relevant topics with a positive spin\u2026 that\u2019s the new MicroVision where the minor dilution of (2.5 million shares sold for $50 million) was done before the 4th Qtr Earnings CC, and not afterwards as has been the case over the past 15 years.\n\nI expect MVIS stock to move forward and not backwards. I would NOT expect that everything is status quo. MicroVision of today is an energetic, vibrant and a wealthy company with a market cap of over $2.5 billion\u2026 a historical high.\n\nSo if you own the stock now at the current price and we find out that things are improving and progressing well, why would you sell?\n\nI would look for a mention that we have 50 million more going into 4th Qtr Earnings CC, that we didn't have a few weeks ago. I would expect that the Lidar A-Sample is on target for April and some key specs have improved. I would expect that we have multiple companies conducting due diligence toward acquiring the company.\n\n**MicroVision: Why a $150 stock when acquired for $20 Billion?**\n\nReal billion dollar ideas have trillion dollar market size, they are scalable, and leverage the drivers of growth to go viral or global.\n\nIn my last [research on MicroVision ](https://www.lerumba.com/Directory/microvision-holds-the-keys-to-the-future-3000-profit-potential-in-over-10-billion-ma-article-132.aspx#.YEpP3Z1KjIU)(NASDAQ: MVIS), I introduced this 20 year old high-tech company that is at the cusp of acquisition by a major technology company. In the last few weeks, MVIS stock price has gone up by 60-fold \\[from 25 cents to over $15\\] on well qualified speculations. Now it is trading in the $14 to $24 range giving new investors the opportunity to take position; for the future of $70 to $150 dollar trading range in the next 12-months or so... depending on the acquisition price of $10 billion or $20 billion.\n\n**Here's the short answer...**\n\nEach of the Six LBS core technology verticals can spawn Trillion dollar markets of the future. Considering the diversity of its product line, built around the LBS core technology over the last 20 years, and protected by it's IP and 500 patents, each core vertical can spawn markets worth trillions, and be worth billions in an acquisition or a merger.\n\n**Why sell the company or merge with a deep pocket Tier 1 Technology partner...**\n\nAt low volumes, the cost of components that MicroVision sells to its Tier 1 partners is 5 to 10 times higher than what it is sold for in anticipation of large quantities... and loosing money on each component sold is what has shaped the company's past blunders loosing millions of dollars each quarter for the last 15 years.\n\nFinally, to sell the company, or to sell one or all of its 6 core vertical engines that can spawn trillion dollar markets, is the right decision. Under the leadership and stewardship of a deep pocket Tier 1 technology partner from the FAMGA gang can truly realize the potential of MicroVision technology, and bring hundred of products to the market that will be sold in billion units per year.\n\nIn the last few weeks, MVIS stock price has gone up by 60-fold \\[from 25 cents to over $14.95\\] on qualified speculations. Now it is trading in the $14 to $24 range giving new investors the opportunity to take position; for the future of $70 to $150 dollar trading range in the next 12- months or so... depending on the acquisition price of $10 billion or $20 billion.\n\n[**What to expect from sale or merger of MicroVision...**](https://www.lerumba.com/Directory/microvision-30-stock-when-acquired-for-5-billion-article-127.aspx#.Xz3sPchKjIX)\n\nOver the last 3 decades, the FAMGA tech giants \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple \u2014 have collectively made [770 acquisitions](https://www.cbinsights.com/search/deals/?invs=1038%2C1167%2C10160%2C12103%2C19786&amp;comStatusIds=2&amp;invStages=M%26A&amp;limit=25&amp;offset=0&amp;displayType=table). Even amid the Covid-19 pandemic, some have continued to write checks, with Apple being the [most active acquirer in 2020 to date](https://www.cbinsights.com/search/deals/?sdate=2020-01-01&amp;edate=2020-05-05&amp;invs=1038%2C1167%2C10160%2C12103%2C19786&amp;comStatusIds=2&amp;invStages=M%26A&amp;limit=25&amp;offset=0&amp;displayType=table) among them.\n\nThis FAMGA group of acquirers has deep pockets. Some of their biggest checks have been written for high-profile companies such as career platform [LinkedIn](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/linkedin) (acquired by Microsoft for $26.2B), chat app [WhatsApp](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/whatsapp) (Facebook for $22B), and video-sharing platform[YouTube](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/youtube) (Google for $1.7B).\n\nLuminar Technologies ([LAZR](http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LAZR?p=LAZR)) went public and the stock price at $40 dollars more than doubled in two days as a public company, with a market cap of over $14 billion\u2026 and made its co-founder CEO Austin Russell a billionaire \u2500 at the age of 25. Luminar specializes in making Lidar sensors for the [automotive sector](http://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/) that will be used in the development of autonomous vehicles.\n\nHowever, the keys to several future technologies are being held by an older company MicroVision that was always ahead of its time. [MicroVision](http://www.microvision.com/) (MVIS), founded in 1993, is most famous for their Micro Electro Mechanical systems (MEMs) and Laser Beam Scanning (LBS) technology that is protected by over 500 patents.\n\nMicroVision\u2019s automotive Lidar will be packaged in a solid-state module that is smaller, cheaper and more versatile than potential competitors like Luminar and Velodyne.\n\nAutonomous vehicles of the future will utilize MicroVision\u2019s Lidar because it is a superior \u201cBest in Class\u201d technology compared to Luminar and Velodyne; and due to its small size, 280M range, and point cloud density of 20 million points per second.\n\nT**OP 5 ACQUISITIONS BY COMPANY**\n\nBelow, we break down each of these companies\u2019 top 5 acquisitions by value.
