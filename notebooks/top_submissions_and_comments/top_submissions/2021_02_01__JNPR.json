        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

        "selftext": "Hey all, I'm very new to trading, had always  wanted to dive in but never really have the disposable income to do so.  \n\n\nI know it can be a risky move, especially for those who don't really have money to play with. But with apps like Robinhood making it a bit simpler to get into the game and buy/sell etc. I figured I'd finally try my luck.  \n\n\nNow I know there's some out there that can drop a few thousand into the market like it's nothing and move from there. However I'm not in that boat and so taking risky chances with what I do have to throw in on a chance that something will jump up is a harder decision for someone like me. At my current rate I figure I can throw in about $50 a week or so, and sometimes more depending on the money I have coming in.  \n\n\nI was wondering what some might think of the decisions I made, based on me assuming the companies I bought into being more 'safe bets' compared to some other options. The stocks I had bought, along with how much I put in (It will be added to and adjusted more evenly over time) are as follows:  \n\n\n**Skyworks (SWKS) - $5**  \n**Intel (INTC) - $5**  \n**Nvidia (NVDA) - $5**  \n**Microsoft (MSFT) - $5**  \n**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) - $30**  \n\n\nNvidia is the one I was most unsure on after buying it, but with what seems like everyone buying GPUs these days, along with a mining surge again, I figured it'd be an okay pick. Not necessarily looking for advice or any of that in the sense of making a bad investment based off of something someone may suggest. Just the thoughts on my choices and possibly adding more to these in the future.  \n\n\nOther options I had considered were Amazon, Apple, and Google. But was unsure on how they would react as the pandemic begins to disappear eventually.",

        "selftext": "Long time trader, first time poster, lol. Went on a bit of an options spree today. Would love to get your feedback:\n\n* **$FVRR** bought Feb 19 '21 210c at $20.86 - this is my strongest conviction trade and largest option position right now. Had previously sold Feb and Mar 200p and 210p. *Finally* started turning around today.\n* **$AMTX** bought Feb 19 '21 10c for $0.94 - closed at $1.05\n* **$EHTH** bought Mar 19 '21 85c for $1.30 - closed down at 0.90 and Feb 19 '21 65c for 1.10 also closed down at 0.90 but this should rebound in short order.\n* **$AMC** closed out most of my remaining Feb and Mar 15c and 3.5c respectively for around 1,000% on a small position.\n* **$BCRX** rolled a prior position into Mar 19 '21 10c for 2.53 (closed at 3.30), June '21 12c for 2.88 (closed at 3.45), and Sep '21 16c for 2.55 (closed at 3.00).\n* **$IRTC** added more to a position I began last week when the stock unexpectedly dropped 40% on medicare reimbursement rates that the company states strongly is merely an administrative error. So far it seems analysts are in general agreement, though some are holding their breath. Today I bought Mar '21 220c for 25.06 (closed at 30.60)\n* **$RIOT** believing that $BTC has about bottomed and will be comin' round the mountain soon, I bought some shares and Feb 05 '21 17c for 3.07 (closed at 3.55). Later in the day I added Feb 05 '21 16c for 4.20 (closed at 4.35) and 20.5c for 1.46 (closed at 1.35)\n* **$UNIT** discovering it as a high conviction trade from Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame--and he was pretty right about $GME in a big way, was he not?--I bought a spread of Aug '21 15c for 1.00 (closed at 0.85) and Jan '22 15c at 1.55 (closed at 1.35) and Jan '22 20c for 0.65 (closed at 0.45).\n* **$NNOX** bought May '21 70c at 17.00 (closed at 17.50) and Aug '21 90c at 17.56 (closed at 30.50 - nice!)\n* **$FUBO** bought Apr '21 50c at 16.05 (closed at 17.30). This was an add to a prior stock and option position.\n* **$RDFN** added to my position here as well. Bought May '21 80c at 9.26 (closed at 9.70) and Aug '21 90c at 9.46 (closed at 10.00).\n* **$PCG** based on some unusual call option activity I noticed, I sold some Mar '21 11p and bought several different calls: Mar '21 12c, 14c; and Jun '21 13c, 15, and 17c. Probably spent too much on commissions here. Whatev. I'm learning the best strategies not just through learning and reviewing theory but also by experimenting with actual trades.\n* **$GME** \\- and this was my revenge trade. I lost a lot of money on this last week, buying shares on the way up then getting stopped out when IBKR halted my ability to do anything but close out. And close out I did at nearly 50% losses. Plus my whole portfolio suffered as brokers, funds and everyone else was liquidating to cover their shorts. In any case, I did a safe trade and a risky trade:\n\n1. Safe: sold Jan '22 25p for 10.00 and 10p for 2.55. Being so far out they haven't moved.. yet.\n2. Risky: bought Feb 05 '21 220p for 53.61 (closed at 52.00) and 190p for 38.59 (closed at 36.20).\n\nOther holdings (some stock, some options, some both):\n\n$TSLA $FVRR $FLGT $ARKK $ARKQ $ARKG $ARKW $SNDL $SOXL $SWKS $EXPI $VXRT $AMZN $PRNT $REGI $ETHE $IPO $LABU $AXON $NERD $TAN $SI $TTGT $SPCX $IPOF $QCLN $NOW $MGNI $SAVA $PENN $WKHS $PBW $SCYX $EDC $WPRT $BUG $ALT\n\nOpen to feedback, questions, your thoughts and insights. Trying to give back for all I've learned here and elsewhere. Cheers!",

        "selftext": "Hey guys! I am quite new to stock market and trading so I\u2019d like to ask you a question I tried to dig into but failed to find any reasoning. \n\nIs anyone here into Skyworks right now? Just recently I bought some SWKS stock and within days it experienced quite good growth as a result (as i understand) of some good reports. \n\nJust recently it fell quite hard, like 10%. And I do not understand why. I searched a lot of news and the only major thing that came up just at that time was some news about Stimulus in the US. But I failed to relate this news to this stock.. so my question is: what was the reason for such a drop? Is it that the stock was overpriced in the first place and it has something with fundamentals? \n\nI am sorry for such silly questions, I just want to understand what info am I missing and try to do better DD in the future.",
