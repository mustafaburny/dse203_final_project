        "selftext": "*For anyone who reads SEC filings, this is a rehash.*\n\nTaking a look at Intel's released 10-Q, here's some quotes:\n\n&gt;\u2022We now expect an approximate six-month delay in our 7nm-based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7nm manufacturing process, which based on recent data, is now trending approximately twelve months behind our internal target. We will continue to invest in our future process technology roadmap, but we will be pragmatic and objective in seeking to deploy the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be our process, external foundry process or a combination of both. Our advanced packaging technologies combined with our disaggregated architecture give us the flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, we now expect that our data center discrete GPU design, \u201cPonte Vecchio\", which was described in our 2019 Form 10-K, will be released in late 2021 or early 2022 utilizing external and internal process technologies combined with our advanced packaging technologies.\n\n&gt;\u2022We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7nm product, a client CPU, in late 2022 or early 2023. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process roadmap, including for holiday 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7nm data center CPU design in the first half of 2023.\n\n\n#They are going to be four years behind AMD ON 7nm production.\n\nI figured I was going to look into what kind of business consumer-grade Intel products were, compared to their server counterpart, and had to look up some specifics for Intel's internal nomenclature.\n\nHere's the results:\n\nIntel DCG (Data Center Group) consists of everything server related. Server processors, network infrastructure, that type of thing.\n\nIntel CCG (Client Computer Group) consists of all consumer stuff. Mobile, PCs, Laptops, etc. The CCG is all consumer-grade stuff for home use.\n\n\nDCG operating income was **$3.1 billion** for **Q2 2020**, compared to **$1.8 billion** in **Q2 2019**. A rise of **+$1.3 billion.**\n\nCCG operating income was **$2.8 billion** for **Q2 2020**, compared with **$3.7 billion** for **Q2 2019**. A drop of **-$0.9 billion.**\n\n||Q2 2020 vs. Q2 2019 | | YTD 2020 vs. YTD 2019 | |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n|| % change | $ Impact | % change | $ Impact |\n|Desktop platform volume |down\t(14)%|\t\t$\t(460)\t| \t\tdown\t(9)%\t|\t$\t(607)|\n|Desktop platform ASP |up\t3%\t|\t$ 61 \t| \t\tup\t3%\t|\t$ 162 \t \t\n|Notebook platform volume|up\t9%\t|$\t434 \t |\t\tup\t15%\t|\t$ 1,501 \t \t\n|Notebook platform ASP| up\t5%\t|$\t274 |\t \t\tup\t1%\t|$\t138 \t \t\n|Adjacent products and other||$ 346 ||\t\t\t$\t650 \t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t\n|**Total change in revenue**||\t\t\t\t\t$\t655 ||\t \t\t\t\t\t$ 1,844 \t  \n\nSo Intel's PC market is down from last year for both the quarter and the year. They claim it's because people are poor due to COVID, but seem to contradict themselves in their statement about why their notebook group is doing so well. I am supremely intrigued to compare AMD's notes on the topic.\n\nTo quote (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;Revenue in Q2 2020 was up 7% compared to Q2 2019, driven by strength in notebook platform demand, strong ASP and higher LTE modem and Wi-Fi sales, partially offset by desktop demand. YTD 2020 up 11% compared to YTD 2019, **driven by strong demand for notebook platform products** and higher LTE modem and Wi-Fi sales. Strength in notebook platform products reflects the increased reliance on PCs as more people are working and learning from home due to COVID-19.\n**While we expect notebook strength in Q3 2020, desktop demand is expected to remain weak in the second half of 2020 as a result of weaker global economic conditions due to COVID-19.**\n\nI'm going to read this as \"When a consumer has the choice of building a desktop out of components, they are going to choose our competitor because they are better.\"\n\nThis is a play on Intel. I am intentionally ignoring AMD because I think Intel is going to become irrillevant in the processor market in the near future.\n\nHere's what I am suggesting: keep an eye on the portable/laptop markets. If AMD has their shit together, we will start to see a more competative AMD/Intel split on laptops. It's pretty difficult to find an AMD laptop now, and if it becomes easier, people are going to start buying the better performer with the better price.\n\nFurther, Intel seems to already be suffering when it comes to desktop unit sales. When AMD puts out their 10-K, take a look at their CCG equivalent numbers, and see what they look like. If there seems to be an equivalent amount gained by AMD which was lost by Intel, it will become more apparent whether this was a COVID related drop, or the fact that Intel's processors are plainly worse by comparison.\n\nFor those interested in a play depending on what AMD has in their 10-K:\n\n   * If AMD has a similar drop in consumer grade sales, take no action\n   * If AMD sees a rise similar to the drop in Intel's report on CCG, **INTC 21 JAN 2022 $30P**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 6th, 2020.\n\n# **For markets in week ahead, investors will gauge the severity of the coronavirus spread  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/for-markets-in-week-ahead-investors-will-gauge-the-severity-of-the-coronavirus-spread.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the week ahead will focus on the severity of the spread of the coronavirus, during what should be a lull between Thursday\u2019s strong jobs report and the upcoming earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks had a bang-up week, in the four days ahead of the long July 4 weekend, with all indexes making sharp gains. A surprise record gain of 4.8 million jobs in June lifted stocks on Thursday, boosting sentiment into the weekend. The S&amp;P 500 was up 4%% at 3,130, and the Dow was up 3.2% at 25,827%, in their best week since June 5. The Nasdaq, up 4.6% posted its best week since May 7 and closed at a record 10,207.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, said the market has further to go, even with new U.S. coronavirus cases reaching a record daily high above 50,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s more weak sellers, and I think the market is in the hands of buyers. I think stocks are going to do pretty well in July,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much cash on the sidelines, and there\u2019s concern about the virus. There\u2019s too much concern about the economy. There is just too much of a wall of worry.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have been able to shrug off the spreading coronavirus outbreak that has resulted in renewed shutdowns of some economic activity and delays to some anticipated openings. There is concern those economic closings could be a blow the recovery, making it more shallow and less sustainable than expected.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season starts mid-month, and there are just a few reports in the coming week. Levi Strauss releases earnings Tuesday, Bed, Bath and Beyond is Wednesday, and Walgreens Boots Alliance reports Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; According to Refinitiv, second-quarter earnings are expect to be down 43%.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings start to roll out, Congress may also be a focus for markets as it negotiates the next round of stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe know July is going to be difficult unless we get more fiscal policy,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. \u201cThe labor market is going to run dry or at least slow down because part of it is helped by government assistance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Congress has a small window after July 20 to debate the phase 4 Covid stimulus package, which is expected to include a renewal of enhanced unemployment benefits that expire at the end of July. But there\u2019s disagreement on what those benefits should be, and how big the package should be. It also is expected to include aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; As states shut activity again, there is concern that some data that has shown big improvements may not continue to do so. \u201cAre markets prepared to see sequential data that doesn\u2019t improve? At some point the markets may pay more attention to that, but right now we\u2019re riding on a wave of better data and positive vaccine news,\u201d Hogan said, adding a worrisome wild card is the extent of the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, there are just a few data releases, including jobless claims Thursday. They will again be important, especially after continuing claims actually rose in the past week\u2019s release by 59,000 to 19.3 million, despite the surge in rehiring, evident in the June employment report.\n*****\n&gt; ISM nonmanufacturing data will be released Monday, and it will also get more than the usual attention.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe key to next week is going to be the ISM services number, which will be important because of the dependence we have on the service side of the economy,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s virus news that may ultimately decide the course of the market and the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s people watching 12 vaccines, but nobody really has an idea on the cadence of the news. If it gets negative, it\u2019s negative for markets,\u201d said Lee. In the past week, stocks reacted to positive vaccine news from Pfizer.\n*****\n&gt; Lee said the market has been able to look past the concerning rise in cases because death rates have been lower in the latest outbreak, which is affecting far more younger people.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s telling us cases are less important than severity,\u201d Lee said, adding the outbreak is still a big risk for markets. \u201cIt would be important for Texas , Florida or California to show a local peak.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, the Treasury will auction $46 billion 3-year notes Tuesday, $29 billion reopened 10-year notes Wednesday and $19 billion in reopened 30-year bonds Thursday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pS6M0lX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/H0UCveg.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/p7VHYM6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/mg7YpB8J/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4L0G4Gw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0rUWTtd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6LOVpzU.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tBlfDmW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8Rk8GYG/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/VLvWgZ7M/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8K649Jh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rmiSV20.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# July Market Seasonality\n\n&gt; At the start of each month, we send members our seasonality report that highlights the historical performance of the US stock market by month. In our July report published yesterday, we highlighted the chart below which shows the Dow's average change by month over the last 100, 50, and 20 years. One notable trend is that over the last 20 years, the Dow has actually averaged declines in half of all months. The summer months have been particularly negative, but July is the one month that stands out on the bullish side. As shown in the table, July is the only month from May through September that has averaged gains over the last 20 years, and the average gain has been quite strong at 1.32%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/avgdow.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Best Quarter Since 1998\n\n&gt; What a quarter the second quarter was, with the S&amp;P 500 Index adding 20.0%, for the best quarter since 1998 and the best second quarter since 1938. Of course, stocks fell 20% in the first quarter, so what we really have is a bad case of whiplash in 2020 thus far.\n\n&gt; \u201cA 20% quarterly gain is quite rare, but the catch is previous large quarterly gains have actually led to continued strength,\u201d according to LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, a quarter later stocks have been higher the past 8 times after gaining at least 15% during the previous quarter.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, future strong returns are quite normal after a big quarter. Although it might not seem likely given the headlines and magnitude of the current bounce, it is important to be aware that extreme strength usually begets more strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2020 is halfway over, which means the third quarter is upon us. Historically, the third quarter has been the weakest quarter of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down more though shows that July has been actually the strongest month during the summer. August and September have tended to be troublesome and dragged the third quarter down.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why Stocks Can Predict The Next President\n\n&gt; Although the fight against COVID-19 continues to dominate the headlines and our thoughts are with those affected, this is an election year and as we get closer to November it will begin to garner more attention. Next week in our Weekly Market Commentary, we will discuss the election in more detail, but today we wanted to share a very interesting connection between the stock market and election.\n\n&gt; Turns out, since 1928, the stock market has accurately predicted the winner of the election 87% of the time and every single year since 1984. It is quite simple. When the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher the three months before the election, the incumbent party usually won, while when stocks were lower, the incumbent party usually lost.\n\n&gt; \u201cThink about it; no one expected Hillary Clinton to lose back in 2016, no one except the stock market that is,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe Dow had a 9-day losing streak directly ahead of the election, while copper (more of a President Trump infrastructure play) was up a record 14 days in a row, setting the stage for the change in party leadership in the White House.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, as we get closer to the election, how stocks are doing could signal who might win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.29.20-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# First Half and Q2 2020 Asset Class Performance\n\n&gt; Global pandemics, bear markets, bull markets, countless records in economic data, and widespread protests made for an eventful first half of 2020, to say the least. In the table below we show the total return of various asset classes using key ETFs in June, Q2, and the first half of 2020. As shown, overall the best performing assets in June could be found outside the US as international stocks surged. Hong Kong (EWH) in particular was the best performing asset in June. Oil (USO) similarly saw solid returns of 8.42% during the month but remained the second-worst performing asset in Q2 behind Natural Gas (UNG) which was also the worst-performing asset in June. Additionally, oil was the worst-performing asset in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, although their returns were more muted in Q2 and June, Treasuries (namely at the long end of the curve) were some of the top performers in the first half. Precious metals similarly were strong performers in the first half with particular strength from silver (SLV) in Q2. Silver actually saw returns in line with cyclical equities in Q2.\n\n&gt; In terms of the US equities space, the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) drastically outperformed closing out June with a 16.91% gain in the first half. In Q2 and June, it was also the best performing major index by a wide margin. On a sector basis, Technology (XLK), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) all rose over 30% in Q2 just like the Nasdaq did, though their first half and June returns were more modest with the exception of the Tech sector whose returns were more in line with that of the Nasdaq.\n\n&gt; Investing based on market cap saw some interesting dynamics as well. Even though small caps are some of the major US indices down the most on the year\u2014S&amp;P 600 Small Caps (IJR) are down 17.89% and the Russell 2000 (IWM) is down 12.96% YTD\u2014there was some catch up in June as these indices were some of the best performers. That applies to both growth and value names though small cap value (IJS) is still one of the most beaten-down groups in the US equities space. On the other hand, large-cap growth (IVW) offered the strongest returns in June, Q2, and the first half when compared to the various other style ETFs.\n\n&gt; Outside of the US, even with big gains in June, countries like Brazil (EWZ), France (EWQ), Italy (EWI), and Spain (EWP) remain down big on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/assetclass0701.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Stronger Before Independence Day Holiday than After\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, the trading day before Independence Day has been stronger than the day after. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 60.9% of the time with average gains of 0.15% and 0.12% respectively on the day before. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly softer on the day before, but still lean bullish. On the trading day after Independence Day all four indexes have declined more frequently than advanced. DJIA has recorded the fewest number of advances while Russell 2000 has the worst average performance with a 0.14% loss.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2874a99c8692a0cb73d5cd8b5f8631e4/11d00da611e2cc9e-52/s500x750/8a9b484d44537a8ac9d3bb6ea482b05a63c8017f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AZZ** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MARK** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$SLP** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$SJR** \n&gt; * **$JMDA** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$CPST**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8Rk8GYG/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3rC0thpy/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 3 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/XH4RkL4.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKFekV6.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EE8hLQU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2scRfYD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eOMTIlF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvKtzSY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/h0DZeOw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w6Eo9Dl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.10.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kiyHjD5.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Paychex, Inc. $76.59\n&gt; **Paychex, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 20th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/17/earnings-and-fiscal-debate-could-be-catalysts-for-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors are braced for a barrage of earnings news, and the debate in Washington around the next stimulus package may also be an important catalyst for markets since it has implications for the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Big tech names, including Microsoft, Intel, Twitter and IBM, are among companies reporting in the week ahead, as is high-flying Tesla. Blue chips Coca-Cola, Verizon, American Express and Travelers are also among the dozens of major companies releasing results.\n*****\n&gt; Congress returns from its break and should pick up the pace of negotiations towards a new fiscal stimulus package, which is expected to address aid for state and local governments and enhanced unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits, including the $600 additional weekly payment now going to millions, is expected to be a hot topic of discussion, as the benefit ends on July 31.\n*****\n&gt; There are just a few items of note on the economic calendar, including existing home sales on Wednesday, unemployment claims data on Thursday and new home sales on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The spread of the coronavirus will also be closely monitored, as well as any signs of medical progress. The Lancet medical journal is expected to release early stage human trial data Monday on a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Push and pull\u2019 in market\n&gt; Investors also will be watching the market\u2019s own dynamics in the week ahead. There is tension within the market between the bubbly run-up of tech and momentum names on the Nasdaq, and the broader market, or S&amp;P 500, which is basically still flat for the year. The Nasdaq is up 17% year to date, but in the past week lagged other indices, turning in a loss, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were both higher.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s outperformance came to an abrupt end Monday, and it has lagged since then. In dramatic fashion, the index rose sharply to new highs, with many big tech names and Tesla also hitting highs. Within the same session, there was a massive reversal in the index and in tech and momentum names, and they closed sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; Now strategists are watching to see if the froth will be let out slowly or blow off in a big move that takes the rest of the market with it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe expect the push and pull of the Nasdaq to continue and have sustained volatility, in our view, throughout the earnings season,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. \u201cVolatility could be to the upside, as well as the downside, but in our view, in aggregate, the Nasdaq is likely to correct.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the volatile reversal in the Nasdaq does not bode well for the Nasdaq, and it could see a 10% correction. There\u2019s been a surge of retail activity in some of the frothiest names, such as Tesla, which surged from about $1,000 at the end of June to a high of $1,795 during Monday\u2019s session. It is since about $300 per share lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe combination of public participation and just incredible valuations makes the sector very, very vulnerable. ... It\u2019s the sector with the highest earnings expectations,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThere\u2019s virtually nothing that management can say at these valuations that\u2019s going to create further upside to these names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tesla and Microsoft report earnings Wednesday, and Twitter reports Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; # A bump up in stimulus\n&gt; As Congress heads back to Washington in the coming week, expectations are rising that the fiscal stimulus package could be slightly more than Republicans were previously expected to approve.\n*****\n&gt; When Congress broke for the July 4 holiday, there was a big divide on how much stimulus should be added, on top of the $2.4 trillion already adopted. The Democratic proposal was for $3 trillion, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said no more than $1 trillion. Now the gulf has narrowed, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the $1.3 trillion under discussions is not enough.\n*****\n&gt; Cornerstone Macro\u2019s Andy Laperriere said the package could now be $1.5 trillion or more, more than he expected just several weeks ago. He said more money is now expected for state and local governments, local schools, public health, virus testing and payments to support individuals..\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRepublicans really want to use this bill to encourage and incentivize businesses and schools to open. But I think the big thing is a month ago, the top priority of Republicans was to keep this bill small,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; One of the most controversial elements of the CARES stimulus package was the $600 weekly payment to people who were already collecting unemployment.\n*****\n&gt; The payment is likely to be significantly reduced and then ultimately phased out, but that will only come after compromise. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some lines-in-the-sand issues, and this is one of them,\u201d said Laperriere, head of policy at Cornerstone.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump has said he won\u2019t sign the bill unless there is a payroll tax cut, which was previously rejected by Congress. Payroll taxes are paid by both employers and employees, and they fund government programs, including Medicare and Social Security.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market could react to the deliberations if they take longer than expected, or the funds are viewed as insufficient.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, Wells Fargo director of rate strategy, said the bond market will focus on how quickly the government plans to payout the stimulus and also the degree to which the Treasury will ultimately have to increase auction sizes to pay for it.\n*****\n&gt; If Congress keeps to its schedule, it needs to approve the package before the end of the month, when it heads to another recess for the entire month of August.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/X7dY3T7L/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/v81m24Jp/alphatrends717202.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/gcf2CYdr/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/FstWbdq4/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YCx2LYFm/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/q7MJsqcD/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/qM09hYxj/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/v85JmMf4/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/xTm8QYrx/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/QdgGnDxL/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/52WW3yJq/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/RVHzKfkZ/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Good and the Bad from Earnings This Week\n\n&gt; Earnings season began at the start of this week with Pepsi (PEP) and the first of the major US banks and brokers reporting Q2 numbers. It was a light week with only 32 companies reporting through Thursday, but in the coming weeks, we'll see 100+ reports on multiple trading days.\n\n&gt; From our Earnings Explorer tool, below is a recap of the results from this week's earnings reports. 78% of companies that reported this week beat consensus analyst EPS estimates, while 72% topped consensus sales estimates. Those are both strong numbers. In terms of future projections, 16% of companies raised guidance, and not one company lowered guidance. That's rare even with the very low number of reports so far.\n\n&gt; While guidance and beat rates were strong, investors still used earnings reports as an opportunity to sell. The average one-day share price change this week for companies in reaction to their earnings reports was a decline of 0.57%. All of those declines came on the initial gap down at the open, however. After averaging a gap down of 0.76% at the open of trading following the earnings release, the average stock that reported gained 0.21% from the open to the close. (The gap down of 0.76% and the open to close gain of 0.21% adds up to the full-day decline of 0.57% mentioned earlier.)\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/earnings.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing all 32 companies that reported Q2 numbers this week (through Thursday). The list is sorted by one-day share price reaction from best to worst. Alcoa (AA) had the best price reaction to earnings this week with a gain of 6.39% yesterday. WNS Global (WNS) put up the second-biggest gain at 6.36%. The next best-performing stocks in reaction to earnings this week only gained 3%+ -- USB and HOMB. Other stocks that reported this week that gained in response to their earnings reports include Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), Taiwan Semi (TSM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and JP Morgan (JPM).\n\n&gt; On the downside, AngioDynamics (ANGO) saw the worst share price reaction to earnings this week when it fell 11.51% on Thursday. Sleep Number (SNBR) was second-worst with a one-day drop of 9.19% yesterday as well.\n\n&gt; While MS, GS, and JPM all posted gains in reaction to earnings this week, other banks like Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) reacted negatively with each falling 4% or more.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/companies.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retail Sales Beat Again\n\n&gt; Retail sales data for June was reported on Thursday, handily beating expectations for the second consecutive month. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, June saw a 7.5% increase month over month, compared with Bloomberg\u2019s consensus expectations for a 5% gain. This comes on the heels of a more than 18% gain in May, but also following by far the lowest reading ever, a 14.7% decline in April.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.17.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Pent-up demand and the continued easing of lockdowns during June likely contributed to the large increase, which saw sales rise across most categories. Sales spiked 8.2% at auto dealers, but even sales excluding autos and gas rose 6.7%. Clothing store sales more than doubled (+105.1%) while sales in the hard-hit food services and drinking places climbed 20%.\n\n&gt; \u201cConsumer spending is still far below pre-pandemic levels and many of the real-time data we are monitoring have begun to level off in the past month,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe remain encouraged by the strong rebound in May and June, but would expect more gradual gains for retail sales in the second half of the year.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# Why A Potential Democrat Sweep May Not Be A Market Worry\n\n&gt; Based on the latest polling data, there\u2019s growing consensus that former Vice President Joe Biden potentially may win the election and Democrats possibly may sweep Congress. Some might think this could be a negative for stocks, as a higher corporate tax rate that reduces earnings could be part of the Democratic platform.\n\n&gt; Early writers of the US Constitution were worried about one party having too much power that could enable factions in Washington, DC, to enact more extreme policies and political ideals, upsetting the carefully balanced apple cart. As we noted in our recently released Midyear Outlook 2020, stocks historically have performed quite well when Congress has been split, although stocks actually have done better than most probably realized when the Democrats were in full control.\n\n&gt; \u201cHigher corporate taxes are quite likely should we see a potential Democratic sweep,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut to blindly say stocks will do poorly is quite a stretch, as historically stocks have done rather well under this .\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher 9 of the past 10 times and 15 of the past 18 times Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress. Although LPL Research anticipates a likely split Congress in November, with the list of overall worries growing, we don\u2019t think a potential Democratic sweep should be at the top of investors\u2019 list of worries.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.15.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best of July Likely Over\n\n&gt; NASDAQ\u2019s mid-year rally came to an end on Tuesday, July 14. During the rally\u2019s 12-day stretch beginning on the third to last day of June through the ninth trading day in July, NASDAQ gained 4.7%. This is well above its average performance since 1985 but less than half of its best showing from 1999. At NASDAQ\u2019s high close during the rally on July 10 it was up 6.0%. Historically around this time in July is when the market has begun to weaken as NASDAQ\u2019s full-month average performance is just 0.9% since 1985.\n\n&gt; In the following chart, July\u2019s seasonal pattern over the last 21 years has been plotted with July 2020, plotted on the right axis for comparison through yesterday\u2019s close. This July\u2019s well above average performance so far called for a second, larger range in order to aid in the comparison. Over the last 21 years the market\u2019s trend has been lower beginning right around mid-month through the close.

A surprise record gain of 4.8 million jobs in June lifted stocks on Thursday, boosting sentiment into the weekend.

I think stocks are going to do pretty well in July,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much cash on the sidelines, and there\u2019s concern about the virus. There\u2019s too much concern about the economy. There is just too much of a wall of worry.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have been able to shrug off the spreading coronavirus outbreak that has resulted in renewed shutdowns of some economic activity and delays to some anticipated openings. There is concern those economic closings could be a blow the recovery, making it more shallow and less sustainable than expected.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season starts mid-month, and there are just a few reports in the coming week. Levi Strauss releases earnings Tuesday, Bed, Bath and Beyond is Wednesday, and Walgreens Boots Alliance reports Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; According to Refinitiv, second-quarter earnings are expect to be down 43%.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings start to roll out, Congress may also be a focus for markets as it negotiates the next round of stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe know July is going to be difficult unless we get more fiscal policy,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. \u201cThe labor market is going to run dry or at least slow down because part of it is helped by government assistance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Congress has a small window after July 20 to debate the phase 4 Covid stimulus package, which is expected to include a renewal of enhanced unemployment benefits that expire at the end of July. But there\u2019s disagreement on what those benefits should be, and how big the package should be. It also is expected to include aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; As states shut activity again, there is concern that some data that has shown big improvements may not continue to do so. \u201cAre markets prepared to see sequential data that doesn\u2019t improve? At some point the markets may pay more attention to that, but right now we\u2019re riding on a wave of better data and positive vaccine news,\u201d Hogan said, adding a worrisome wild card is the extent of the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, there are just a few data releases, including jobless claims Thursday. They will again be important, especially after continuing claims actually rose in the past week\u2019s release by 59,000 to 19.3 million, despite the surge in rehiring, evident in the June employment report.\n*****\n&gt; ISM nonmanufacturing data will be released Monday, and it will also get more than the usual attention.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe key to next week is going to be the ISM services number, which will be important because of the dependence we have on the service side of the economy,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s virus news that may ultimately decide the course of the market and the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s people watching 12 vaccines, but nobody really has an idea on the cadence of the news. If it gets negative, it\u2019s negative for markets,\u201d said Lee. In the past week, stocks reacted to positive vaccine news from Pfizer.\n*****\n&gt; Lee said the market has been able to look past the concerning rise in cases because death rates have been lower in the latest outbreak, which is affecting far more younger people.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s telling us cases are less important than severity,\u201d Lee said, adding the outbreak is still a big risk for markets. \u201cIt would be important for Texas , Florida or California to show a local peak.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, the Treasury will auction $46 billion 3-year notes Tuesday, $29 billion reopened 10-year notes Wednesday and $19 billion in reopened 30-year bonds Thursday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pS6M0lX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/H0UCveg.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/p7VHYM6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/mg7YpB8J/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4L0G4Gw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0rUWTtd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6LOVpzU.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tBlfDmW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/VLvWgZ7M/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8K649Jh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rmiSV20.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# July Market Seasonality\n\n&gt; At the start of each month, we send members our seasonality report that highlights the historical performance of the US stock market by month. In our July report published yesterday, we highlighted the chart below which shows the Dow's average change by month over the last 100, 50, and 20 years. One notable trend is that over the last 20 years, the Dow has actually averaged declines in half of all months. The summer months have been particularly negative, but July is the one month that stands out on the bullish side. As shown in the table, July is the only month from May through September that has averaged gains over the last 20 years, and the average gain has been quite strong at 1.32%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/avgdow.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Best Quarter Since 1998\n\n&gt; What a quarter the second quarter was, with the S&amp;P 500 Index adding 20.0%, for the best quarter since 1998 and the best second quarter since 1938. Of course, stocks fell 20% in the first quarter, so what we really have is a bad case of whiplash in 2020 thus far.\n\n&gt; \u201cA 20% quarterly gain is quite rare, but the catch is previous large quarterly gains have actually led to continued strength,\u201d according to LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, a quarter later stocks have been higher the past 8 times after gaining at least 15% during the previous quarter.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, future strong returns are quite normal after a big quarter. Although it might not seem likely given the headlines and magnitude of the current bounce, it is important to be aware that extreme strength usually begets more strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2020 is halfway over, which means the third quarter is upon us. Historically, the third quarter has been the weakest quarter of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down more though shows that July has been actually the strongest month during the summer. August and September have tended to be troublesome and dragged the third quarter down.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why Stocks Can Predict The Next President\n\n&gt; Although the fight against COVID-19 continues to dominate the headlines and our thoughts are with those affected, this is an election year and as we get closer to November it will begin to garner more attention. Next week in our Weekly Market Commentary, we will discuss the election in more detail, but today we wanted to share a very interesting connection between the stock market and election.\n\n&gt; Turns out, since 1928, the stock market has accurately predicted the winner of the election 87% of the time and every single year since 1984. It is quite simple. When the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher the three months before the election, the incumbent party usually won, while when stocks were lower, the incumbent party usually lost.\n\n&gt; \u201cThink about it; no one expected Hillary Clinton to lose back in 2016, no one except the stock market that is,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe Dow had a 9-day losing streak directly ahead of the election, while copper (more of a President Trump infrastructure play) was up a record 14 days in a row, setting the stage for the change in party leadership in the White House.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, as we get closer to the election, how stocks are doing could signal who might win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.29.20-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# First Half and Q2 2020 Asset Class Performance\n\n&gt; Global pandemics, bear markets, bull markets, countless records in economic data, and widespread protests made for an eventful first half of 2020, to say the least. In the table below we show the total return of various asset classes using key ETFs in June, Q2, and the first half of 2020. As shown, overall the best performing assets in June could be found outside the US as international stocks surged. Hong Kong (EWH) in particular was the best performing asset in June. Oil (USO) similarly saw solid returns of 8.42% during the month but remained the second-worst performing asset in Q2 behind Natural Gas (UNG) which was also the worst-performing asset in June. Additionally, oil was the worst-performing asset in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, although their returns were more muted in Q2 and June, Treasuries (namely at the long end of the curve) were some of the top performers in the first half. Precious metals similarly were strong performers in the first half with particular strength from silver (SLV) in Q2. Silver actually saw returns in line with cyclical equities in Q2.\n\n&gt; In terms of the US equities space, the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) drastically outperformed closing out June with a 16.91% gain in the first half. In Q2 and June, it was also the best performing major index by a wide margin. On a sector basis, Technology (XLK), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) all rose over 30% in Q2 just like the Nasdaq did, though their first half and June returns were more modest with the exception of the Tech sector whose returns were more in line with that of the Nasdaq.\n\n&gt; Investing based on market cap saw some interesting dynamics as well. Even though small caps are some of the major US indices down the most on the year\u2014S&amp;P 600 Small Caps (IJR) are down 17.89% and the Russell 2000 (IWM) is down 12.96% YTD\u2014there was some catch up in June as these indices were some of the best performers. That applies to both growth and value names though small cap value (IJS) is still one of the most beaten-down groups in the US equities space. On the other hand, large-cap growth (IVW) offered the strongest returns in June, Q2, and the first half when compared to the various other style ETFs.\n\n&gt; Outside of the US, even with big gains in June, countries like Brazil (EWZ), France (EWQ), Italy (EWI), and Spain (EWP) remain down big on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/assetclass0701.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Stronger Before Independence Day Holiday than After\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, the trading day before Independence Day has been stronger than the day after. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 60.9% of the time with average gains of 0.15% and 0.12% respectively on the day before. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly softer on the day before, but still lean bullish. On the trading day after Independence Day all four indexes have declined more frequently than advanced. DJIA has recorded the fewest number of advances while Russell 2000 has the worst average performance with a 0.14% loss.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2874a99c8692a0cb73d5cd8b5f8631e4/11d00da611e2cc9e-52/s500x750/8a9b484d44537a8ac9d3bb6ea482b05a63c8017f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AZZ** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$MARK** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$SLP** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$SJR** \n&gt; * **$JMDA** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$CPST**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/x8Rk8GYG/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3rC0thpy/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 3 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/XH4RkL4.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKFekV6.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.7.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EE8hLQU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2scRfYD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eOMTIlF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvKtzSY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/h0DZeOw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/w6Eo9Dl.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.10.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.10.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kiyHjD5.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Paychex, Inc. $76.59\n&gt; **Paychex, Inc.

        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 6th, 2020.\n\n# **For markets in week ahead, investors will gauge the severity of the coronavirus spread  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/for-markets-in-week-ahead-investors-will-gauge-the-severity-of-the-coronavirus-spread.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the week ahead will focus on the severity of the spread of the coronavirus, during what should be a lull between Thursday\u2019s strong jobs report and the upcoming earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks had a bang-up week, in the four days ahead of the long July 4 weekend, with all indexes making sharp gains. A surprise record gain of 4.8 million jobs in June lifted stocks on Thursday, boosting sentiment into the weekend. The S&amp;P 500 was up 4%% at 3,130, and the Dow was up 3.2% at 25,827%, in their best week since June 5. The Nasdaq, up 4.6% posted its best week since May 7 and closed at a record 10,207.\n*****\n&gt; Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, said the market has further to go, even with new U.S. coronavirus cases reaching a record daily high above 50,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s more weak sellers, and I think the market is in the hands of buyers. I think stocks are going to do pretty well in July,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much cash on the sidelines, and there\u2019s concern about the virus. There\u2019s too much concern about the economy. There is just too much of a wall of worry.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have been able to shrug off the spreading coronavirus outbreak that has resulted in renewed shutdowns of some economic activity and delays to some anticipated openings. There is concern those economic closings could be a blow the recovery, making it more shallow and less sustainable than expected.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season starts mid-month, and there are just a few reports in the coming week. Levi Strauss releases earnings Tuesday, Bed, Bath and Beyond is Wednesday, and Walgreens Boots Alliance reports Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; According to Refinitiv, second-quarter earnings are expect to be down 43%.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings start to roll out, Congress may also be a focus for markets as it negotiates the next round of stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe know July is going to be difficult unless we get more fiscal policy,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. \u201cThe labor market is going to run dry or at least slow down because part of it is helped by government assistance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Congress has a small window after July 20 to debate the phase 4 Covid stimulus package, which is expected to include a renewal of enhanced unemployment benefits that expire at the end of July. But there\u2019s disagreement on what those benefits should be, and how big the package should be. It also is expected to include aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; As states shut activity again, there is concern that some data that has shown big improvements may not continue to do so. \u201cAre markets prepared to see sequential data that doesn\u2019t improve? At some point the markets may pay more attention to that, but right now we\u2019re riding on a wave of better data and positive vaccine news,\u201d Hogan said, adding a worrisome wild card is the extent of the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, there are just a few data releases, including jobless claims Thursday. They will again be important, especially after continuing claims actually rose in the past week\u2019s release by 59,000 to 19.3 million, despite the surge in rehiring, evident in the June employment report.\n*****\n&gt; ISM nonmanufacturing data will be released Monday, and it will also get more than the usual attention.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe key to next week is going to be the ISM services number, which will be important because of the dependence we have on the service side of the economy,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s virus news that may ultimately decide the course of the market and the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s people watching 12 vaccines, but nobody really has an idea on the cadence of the news. If it gets negative, it\u2019s negative for markets,\u201d said Lee. In the past week, stocks reacted to positive vaccine news from Pfizer.\n*****\n&gt; Lee said the market has been able to look past the concerning rise in cases because death rates have been lower in the latest outbreak, which is affecting far more younger people.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s telling us cases are less important than severity,\u201d Lee said, adding the outbreak is still a big risk for markets. \u201cIt would be important for Texas , Florida or California to show a local peak.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, the Treasury will auction $46 billion 3-year notes Tuesday, $29 billion reopened 10-year notes Wednesday and $19 billion in reopened 30-year bonds Thursday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/pS6M0lX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/H0UCveg.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/p7VHYM6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/mg7YpB8J/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4L0G4Gw.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0rUWTtd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6LOVpzU.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tBlfDmW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/VLvWgZ7M/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8K649Jh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rmiSV20.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# July Market Seasonality\n\n&gt; At the start of each month, we send members our seasonality report that highlights the historical performance of the US stock market by month. In our July report published yesterday, we highlighted the chart below which shows the Dow's average change by month over the last 100, 50, and 20 years. One notable trend is that over the last 20 years, the Dow has actually averaged declines in half of all months. The summer months have been particularly negative, but July is the one month that stands out on the bullish side. As shown in the table, July is the only month from May through September that has averaged gains over the last 20 years, and the average gain has been quite strong at 1.32%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/avgdow.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Best Quarter Since 1998\n\n&gt; What a quarter the second quarter was, with the S&amp;P 500 Index adding 20.0%, for the best quarter since 1998 and the best second quarter since 1938. Of course, stocks fell 20% in the first quarter, so what we really have is a bad case of whiplash in 2020 thus far.\n\n&gt; \u201cA 20% quarterly gain is quite rare, but the catch is previous large quarterly gains have actually led to continued strength,\u201d according to LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, a quarter later stocks have been higher the past 8 times after gaining at least 15% during the previous quarter.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, future strong returns are quite normal after a big quarter. Although it might not seem likely given the headlines and magnitude of the current bounce, it is important to be aware that extreme strength usually begets more strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; 2020 is halfway over, which means the third quarter is upon us. Historically, the third quarter has been the weakest quarter of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down more though shows that July has been actually the strongest month during the summer. August and September have tended to be troublesome and dragged the third quarter down.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.1.20-blog-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why Stocks Can Predict The Next President\n\n&gt; Although the fight against COVID-19 continues to dominate the headlines and our thoughts are with those affected, this is an election year and as we get closer to November it will begin to garner more attention. Next week in our Weekly Market Commentary, we will discuss the election in more detail, but today we wanted to share a very interesting connection between the stock market and election.\n\n&gt; Turns out, since 1928, the stock market has accurately predicted the winner of the election 87% of the time and every single year since 1984. It is quite simple. When the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher the three months before the election, the incumbent party usually won, while when stocks were lower, the incumbent party usually lost.\n\n&gt; \u201cThink about it; no one expected Hillary Clinton to lose back in 2016, no one except the stock market that is,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe Dow had a 9-day losing streak directly ahead of the election, while copper (more of a President Trump infrastructure play) was up a record 14 days in a row, setting the stage for the change in party leadership in the White House.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, as we get closer to the election, how stocks are doing could signal who might win in November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.29.20-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# First Half and Q2 2020 Asset Class Performance\n\n&gt; Global pandemics, bear markets, bull markets, countless records in economic data, and widespread protests made for an eventful first half of 2020, to say the least. In the table below we show the total return of various asset classes using key ETFs in June, Q2, and the first half of 2020. As shown, overall the best performing assets in June could be found outside the US as international stocks surged. Hong Kong (EWH) in particular was the best performing asset in June. Oil (USO) similarly saw solid returns of 8.42% during the month but remained the second-worst performing asset in Q2 behind Natural Gas (UNG) which was also the worst-performing asset in June. Additionally, oil was the worst-performing asset in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, although their returns were more muted in Q2 and June, Treasuries (namely at the long end of the curve) were some of the top performers in the first half. Precious metals similarly were strong performers in the first half with particular strength from silver (SLV) in Q2. Silver actually saw returns in line with cyclical equities in Q2.\n\n&gt; In terms of the US equities space, the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) drastically outperformed closing out June with a 16.91% gain in the first half. In Q2 and June, it was also the best performing major index by a wide margin. On a sector basis, Technology (XLK), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) all rose over 30% in Q2 just like the Nasdaq did, though their first half and June returns were more modest with the exception of the Tech sector whose returns were more in line with that of the Nasdaq.\n\n&gt; Investing based on market cap saw some interesting dynamics as well. Even though small caps are some of the major US indices down the most on the year\u2014S&amp;P 600 Small Caps (IJR) are down 17.89% and the Russell 2000 (IWM) is down 12.96% YTD\u2014there was some catch up in June as these indices were some of the best performers. That applies to both growth and value names though small cap value (IJS) is still one of the most beaten-down groups in the US equities space. On the other hand, large-cap growth (IVW) offered the strongest returns in June, Q2, and the first half when compared to the various other style ETFs.\n\n&gt; Outside of the US, even with big gains in June, countries like Brazil (EWZ), France (EWQ), Italy (EWI), and Spain (EWP) remain down big on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/assetclass0701.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Stronger Before Independence Day Holiday than After\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, the trading day before Independence Day has been stronger than the day after.
