        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 6th, 2021.\n\n# **More turbulence could be ahead for stocks as investors weigh omicron and the Fed\u2019s next steps - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/stocks-could-face-more-turbulence-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Volatility could continue to plague markets after a week of violent swings that sent many stocks plummeting.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, investors await more news on the omicron Covid variant and another inflation report Friday that is expected to show consumer prices remain the hottest in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks sold off on worries about the omicron variant and concerns the Federal Reserve will move away from its easy policies and raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a Congressional panel Tuesday that the central bank will consider speeding up the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program when it meets Dec. 14 and 15. The Federal Reserve put its bond-purchasing program in place in early 2020 to prop up the economy during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a somewhat turbulent December because we probably need to wait for earnings season to get regrounded, back to fundamentals,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. \u201cFor as high as a lot of the ratios would suggest, price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, when you throw it into the hopper with interest rates and everything else, things aren\u2019t that bad. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re teetering on the edge of a cliff.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Ablin did say the comments from Powell were unnerving investors, who fear the Fed will also speed up interest rate hikes. Powell acknowledged he was wrong about inflation being \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, spooking investors. The bond purchases are now scheduled to end in June.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m not sure what investors\u2019 read on inflation is. Do they think the Fed is going to raise rates, get ahead of it too early and everything is going to roll over? Ever since Powell took \u2018transitory\u2019 out of his talk, investors have been somewhat off balance,\u201d said Ablin.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index or CPI for November is expected Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones predict it rose 0.6% on a monthly basis, or 6.7% year over year. That compares to a 0.9% gain in October, and a 6.2% jump year over year, the biggest move in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; # Risky names slammed\nHigh fliers and growth were among the hardest hit Friday, as investors bailed out of some of the riskiest stocks. As stocks plunged Friday, Treasury yields fell. Yields move opposite price, and the move was seen as a flight to safety. The 10-year note yield fell to 1.35%.\n*****\n&gt; The ARK Innovation ETF was down nearly 12.7% for the week. Most of the growth names in the fund plunged into bear market territory. \u201cI think investors have to keep in mind that\u2019s not a 15-week strategy. It\u2019s a 15-year strategy, as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d Ablin said.\n*****\n&gt; For the week, the small cap Russell 2000 was down nearly 4%, while the S&amp;P 500 was off just 1.2%. The worst performing major sector for the week was communications services, which includes internet companies. It was down 2.8%, followed by consumer discretionary, off 2.4%. Financials lost nearly 2%, and the S&amp;P technology sector was down 0.4% for the week. But on Friday, tech lost 1.7%.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve should be quiet in the week ahead. Fed officials traditionally do not make major speeches in the blackout period, which is the coming week, ahead of their Dec. 14 and 15 meeting. One exception is Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari who speaks Thursday at the Center for Indian Country Development Research Summit.\n*****\n&gt; Much of the focus will be on how the market itself is performing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEver since the Nov. 22 outside bearish day, all strength has been sold with lots of damage underneath the hood,\u201d said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. \u201cNow finally some of the leadership names are showing faulty action.\u201d He noted that both Microsoft and Apple were weaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMoney is not hiding in Amazon, Google, or Facebook. They haven\u2019t been special for weeks,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P closed below its 50-day moving average Friday, after closing below it Wednesday. The 50-day is at 4,544. That\u2019s a signal to some market technicians that the index is on the verge of breaking down. The 50-day moving average is the average closing price over the past 50 days, and is viewed as a momentum indicator.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBasically, it\u2019s effectively a retest of support because we had the relief rally [Thursday],\u201d said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies. She said the S&amp;P 500 needs to close below the 50-day for two consecutive days before the move is considered a breakdown.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe action in the high growth, high multiple names is not a good sign,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cWe do have some signs of downside exhaustion but not as widespread as I would hope. We\u2019re seeing some of the heavyweights, like Adobe for example, taking out levels like the 50-day moving averages.\u201d She said some of those big names have now joined the selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re just watching how bad it gets. Monday is going to be the tell,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cThat also gives it the weekend to settle... Extremes have gotten a little bit more extreme. Sentiment is the most oversold from a contrarian perspective since the October low.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/hk2QMMD.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/w6utI7X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N8u66xV.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tagANgL.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/t8zd2PY.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fEvF2Bm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ponrnUL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SqxThz0.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3QmNJUa.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sz567v5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/s9GIfxy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBWalJo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7EeMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small-Cap Corrections\n\n&gt; At the close on Wednesday (12/1), the small-cap Russell 2,000 had fallen 12.1% from its recent high on November 8th, leaving the index in \"correction\" territory. A market \"correction\" is a drop of 10%+ that was preceded by a rally of at least 10% on a closing basis. This correction for the Russell 2,000 is its 58th since data for the index begins in 1978. Below is a table showing prior corrections for the Russell. The average correction sees the index fall 18.35%, which is just shy of the 20% threshold for a \"bear market.\" The median correction is a little smaller at -15.4%. In terms of length, the average Russell correction has lasted 73 days, while the median is 62 days. For the current Russell 2,000 correction to reach average levels, it would need to fall another 7% from here, and it would come to an end on January 20th, 2022.\n\n&gt; In terms of extremes, the biggest correction that the Russell 2,000 has ever experienced was the 41.9% decline seen during the initial COVID Crash from 1/16/20 to 3/18/20. The longest correction lasted 397 days from 6/24/83 to 7/25/84. In terms of the shortest correction, there were two that lasted 3 days. One of those came during the Financial Crisis while the other happened last June.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/raycorrec.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak\n\n&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.\n\n&gt; This is what used to be known as the \u201cJanuary Effect:\u201d small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/84caf5990b652671445781962a51ee2f/b2ebb400780bd4c8-af/s500x750/1795f2bbf763fb254a002bda32bd9b217881240b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Cap Effect &amp; Santa Claus Rally\n\n&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n&gt; December is the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not all that likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen post-election years, December\u2019s ranking slip to #7 S&amp;P 500, #7 NASDAQ and DJIA #5. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, tend to have a field day in post-election-year Decembers. Since 1981, the Russell 2000 has lost ground three time in ten post-election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 2.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/64044be6e473181304fe66b98074cbde/5618185eea1cfe29-fe/s400x600/931f46ef694541cebb05ea5f3193a5faa1f6bc60.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on December 27 and lasts until the second trading day of 2022. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n&gt; Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 6 Things To Know About December And Omicron\n\n&gt; Here comes December, historically a pretty solid month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant wreaking havoc on markets. \u201cWhat a difference a week makes. A week ago stocks were at all-time highs and the economy was strong. Now all we have are uncertainties and questions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs of now we\u2019re optimistic that stocks will sidestep the new variant worries, but we recommend investors buckle up their seatbelts, as the end of 2021 could be a bumpy one.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here are six things to think about as we head into the jolliest month of them all.\n\n&gt; First, historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 1.5% on average in December, which is the third best month of the year with only April and November better. But as you can see here, over the past 10 years, December has been much weaker. Of course, much of this was due to a huge 9.2% drop in 2018 (which we\u2019ll get to soon enough).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, some more good news is December has been up 74.3% of the time, more than any other month of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-2-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; drop in 2018. Only once in history was December the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500 and it was indeed in 2018. Three times it was the second worst month of the year, in 1968, 1980, and 1996. The worst monthly return so far this year was a 4.8% drop in September.\n\n&gt; Fourth, stocks usually don\u2019t get moving until the second half of the month, right as the holiday good feel vibes start to come out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Fifth, this year is in rare air, as all 11 months have made a new all-time high so far. Should the S&amp;P 500 make new highs in December that would be a perfect 12 for 12, matching 2014 as the only years to complete this incredible feat.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sixth, as we show in the LPL Chart of the Day, it turns out that when stocks are up more than 20% for the year heading into December (like 2021), the final month actually does better, up 1.7% versus 1.5%. Also, it has been higher eight of the past nine times the year was up more than 20% heading into the final month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Came Up Short in November\n\n&gt; The domestic economy added just 210,000 jobs during November, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus forecast for a gain of 550,000 and below October\u2019s revised tally of 546,000. The net revision to prior months was positive but only by 82,000.\n\n&gt; The modest 23,000 gain in leisure and hospitality jobs, which were up 170,000 in October, and a 20,000 drop in retail jobs don\u2019t make much sense given solid retail sales data of late. That could set up a positive reversal from revisions next month, though that potential bump will play some tug-of-war with the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, which came after the November survey period ended.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, for the past four months the pace of job gains has been well below the pre-Delta variant levels of near 1 million back in June and July. However, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic that job growth picks up in early 2022, assuming the Omicron variant doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe job growth number is disappointing, no doubt, especially considering the survey period fell before we even know the name of the newest Covid-19 variant,\u201d noted LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile Omicron may curb hiring a bit over the next month or two, we remain confident in our expectation for strong job gains and above-average growth in the U.S. economy in 2022.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-12.3.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The story was clearly better when looking at the unemployment rate, derived from the household survey rather than from employers. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell from 4.6% to 4.2% in November as workers\u2014in an encouraging sign\u2014came off the sidelines (1.14 million of them), lifting the participation rate by 0.2% to 61.8%, a post-recession high but still well off pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&gt; Inflation data also painted a somewhat reassuring picture. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings rose less than expected at 4.8% (+0.3% month over month), below consensus expectations of 5.0% and 0.4%, and not enough to keep up with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the increase in labor participation helped limit wage increases, but we have a long way to go there still. The labor market is still 3.9 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels and the labor market remains under-supplied, as noted above. In other words, further improvement in participation will still be needed to help contain inflation pressure.\n\n&gt; Some will argue that this report will make the Federal Reserve (Fed) think twice before accelerating tapering of its bond purchases, but we\u2019re not so sure.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere were a number of positives with this jobs report,\u201d explained LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. \u201cLabor force participation increased and the unemployment rate fell\u2014both of which point to a continued strong jobs market. That may give the Fed reasons to speed up its tapering plans.\u201d\n\n&gt; Overall, this report is a disappointing reminder that we\u2019re going to have to wait longer for the booming jobs numbers that we still expect to see. We continue to expect more people to get back to work in the months ahead, in an environment of strong labor demand, which can help alleviate wage pressure and firm up the economic growth outlook. Omicron is a risk but based on the information we have today, we do not expect that variant, or any others, to meaningfully slow the job market recovery in 2022.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 3rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.5.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$CHPT $GME $LULU $CHWY $COST $AZO $RH $SAIC $LOVE $AVGO $DLHC $PATH $COUP $MDB $ASO $DBI $THO $ORCL $PLAY $CBP $SFIX $HRL $S $CONN $SUMO $SOL $UNFI $KFY $GTLB $CIEN $ALCO $PD $TOL $HQY $CASY $CNM $VRA $GEF $JW.A $ALOT $PLAB $AOUT**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ARPnz4g.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/V8bYDe5.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/br3K0zL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hbGoBFe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.7.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tM8wghC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hhcFlGr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lPByiPr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FNjpxcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2PUPQhA.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6kqQxly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/OcHR8nI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. $21.57\n&gt; **ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.

        "selftext": "I own Microsoft. I\u2019m not selling it, but I looked at the past 20 years for Microsoft and up until 5 years ago, the price never cracked into the 60s. 2016 you could buy the stock for 50 bucks a share. And the price had stated between 20-50 dollars for the better part of 20 years. Now it\u2019s 323?? If you look at the 20 years graph it really is pretty damn parabolic. \n\nI know everyone is dooming about a market crash or correction, but I honestly think the Covid news will dissipate. We will see 10% loses and people will get in quick and hit new all time highs. That\u2019s just my guess, and I\u2019m a long term investor so I don\u2019t care too much about what happens in the day to day or even month to month. \n\nWhat I do care about though is whether I should dump a ton of money into Microsoft now, or just a little bit anticipating a correction. Because it\u2019s parabolic, I don\u2019t feel confident it would continue, but who knows. \n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\nNote: I love Microsoft and it\u2019ll be worth a hell of a lot more in 10 years than it will be today, even if we are super inflated.",

        "selftext": "\nOne of the most interesting rebuttals to bears pointing out the obvious flaws and bad price action in ARK is \u201cbuy the dip because Cathie Wood said this is a 5 year plan\u201d. This sounds great in theory and probably calms the bag holders at night, but realistically it\u2019s horrible advice. \n\nIn 2000 dot com bubble, people who were buying every stock with dot com at the end probably thought it was a good idea. In fact, when the bubble popped and many investors kept averaging down, they probably had the same thought. It\u2019ll go back up in 5 years anyways, right? Wrong. From the peak of the tech bubble, it took the NASDAQ nearly 12 years to return back to where it was. Even if you picked the top of the cream, let\u2019s say Microsoft - MSFT did not return to its peak 2000 price again until 2010. So, saying everything is a 5 year plan and you\u2019ll be a millionaire in 2026 is great, until you\u2019re stuck holding a stock or in this case, ETF, for 10 years in the red. \n\nWhat makes all of this worse is that Cathie Wood trades daily. One of the reason indexes tend to go up is because the winners tend to occupy larger and larger percentages of the index over time. For example, there could be a company today that\u2019s only a small percentage of the index but if the company continues to perform strongly and the stock goes up, it becomes a larger portion of the index, thus benefiting the index holder. But Cathie doesn\u2019t let that natural process take place. She constantly sells Tesla on up days to dilute her funds with other stocks, that may not be nearly as strong. This destroys the entire purpose of a 5 year plan. \n\nBuyer beware on ARK and if you\u2019re a bag holder, probably a good idea to sell. Good luck to all.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 6th, 2021.\n\n# **More turbulence could be ahead for stocks as investors weigh omicron and the Fed\u2019s next steps - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/stocks-could-face-more-turbulence-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Volatility could continue to plague markets after a week of violent swings that sent many stocks plummeting.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, investors await more news on the omicron Covid variant and another inflation report Friday that is expected to show consumer prices remain the hottest in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks sold off on worries about the omicron variant and concerns the Federal Reserve will move away from its easy policies and raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a Congressional panel Tuesday that the central bank will consider speeding up the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program when it meets Dec. 14 and 15. The Federal Reserve put its bond-purchasing program in place in early 2020 to prop up the economy during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a somewhat turbulent December because we probably need to wait for earnings season to get regrounded, back to fundamentals,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. \u201cFor as high as a lot of the ratios would suggest, price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, when you throw it into the hopper with interest rates and everything else, things aren\u2019t that bad. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re teetering on the edge of a cliff.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Ablin did say the comments from Powell were unnerving investors, who fear the Fed will also speed up interest rate hikes. Powell acknowledged he was wrong about inflation being \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, spooking investors. The bond purchases are now scheduled to end in June.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m not sure what investors\u2019 read on inflation is. Do they think the Fed is going to raise rates, get ahead of it too early and everything is going to roll over? Ever since Powell took \u2018transitory\u2019 out of his talk, investors have been somewhat off balance,\u201d said Ablin.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index or CPI for November is expected Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones predict it rose 0.6% on a monthly basis, or 6.7% year over year. That compares to a 0.9% gain in October, and a 6.2% jump year over year, the biggest move in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; # Risky names slammed\nHigh fliers and growth were among the hardest hit Friday, as investors bailed out of some of the riskiest stocks. As stocks plunged Friday, Treasury yields fell. Yields move opposite price, and the move was seen as a flight to safety. The 10-year note yield fell to 1.35%.\n*****\n&gt; The ARK Innovation ETF was down nearly 12.7% for the week. Most of the growth names in the fund plunged into bear market territory. \u201cI think investors have to keep in mind that\u2019s not a 15-week strategy. It\u2019s a 15-year strategy, as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d Ablin said.\n*****\n&gt; For the week, the small cap Russell 2000 was down nearly 4%, while the S&amp;P 500 was off just 1.2%. The worst performing major sector for the week was communications services, which includes internet companies. It was down 2.8%, followed by consumer discretionary, off 2.4%. Financials lost nearly 2%, and the S&amp;P technology sector was down 0.4% for the week. But on Friday, tech lost 1.7%.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve should be quiet in the week ahead. Fed officials traditionally do not make major speeches in the blackout period, which is the coming week, ahead of their Dec. 14 and 15 meeting. One exception is Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari who speaks Thursday at the Center for Indian Country Development Research Summit.\n*****\n&gt; Much of the focus will be on how the market itself is performing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEver since the Nov. 22 outside bearish day, all strength has been sold with lots of damage underneath the hood,\u201d said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. \u201cNow finally some of the leadership names are showing faulty action.\u201d He noted that both Microsoft and Apple were weaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMoney is not hiding in Amazon, Google, or Facebook. They haven\u2019t been special for weeks,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P closed below its 50-day moving average Friday, after closing below it Wednesday. The 50-day is at 4,544. That\u2019s a signal to some market technicians that the index is on the verge of breaking down. The 50-day moving average is the average closing price over the past 50 days, and is viewed as a momentum indicator.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBasically, it\u2019s effectively a retest of support because we had the relief rally [Thursday],\u201d said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies. She said the S&amp;P 500 needs to close below the 50-day for two consecutive days before the move is considered a breakdown.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe action in the high growth, high multiple names is not a good sign,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cWe do have some signs of downside exhaustion but not as widespread as I would hope.

A market \"correction\" is a drop of 10%+ that was preceded by a rally of at least 10% on a closing basis. This correction for the Russell 2,000 is its 58th since data for the index begins in 1978. Below is a table showing prior corrections for the Russell. The average correction sees the index fall 18.35%, which is just shy of the 20% threshold for a \"bear market.\" The median correction is a little smaller at -15.4%. In terms of length, the average Russell correction has lasted 73 days, while the median is 62 days. For the current Russell 2,000 correction to reach average levels, it would need to fall another 7% from here, and it would come to an end on January 20th, 2022.\n\n&gt; In terms of extremes, the biggest correction that the Russell 2,000 has ever experienced was the 41.9% decline seen during the initial COVID Crash from 1/16/20 to 3/18/20. The longest correction lasted 397 days from 6/24/83 to 7/25/84. In terms of the shortest correction, there were two that lasted 3 days. One of those came during the Financial Crisis while the other happened last June.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/raycorrec.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak\n\n&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.\n\n&gt; This is what used to be known as the \u201cJanuary Effect:\u201d small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/84caf5990b652671445781962a51ee2f/b2ebb400780bd4c8-af/s500x750/1795f2bbf763fb254a002bda32bd9b217881240b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Cap Effect &amp; Santa Claus Rally\n\n&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n&gt; December is the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not all that likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen post-election years, December\u2019s ranking slip to #7 S&amp;P 500, #7 NASDAQ and DJIA #5. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, tend to have a field day in post-election-year Decembers. Since 1981, the Russell 2000 has lost ground three time in ten post-election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 2.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/64044be6e473181304fe66b98074cbde/5618185eea1cfe29-fe/s400x600/931f46ef694541cebb05ea5f3193a5faa1f6bc60.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on December 27 and lasts until the second trading day of 2022. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n&gt; Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 6 Things To Know About December And Omicron\n\n&gt; Here comes December, historically a pretty solid month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant wreaking havoc on markets. \u201cWhat a difference a week makes. A week ago stocks were at all-time highs and the economy was strong. Now all we have are uncertainties and questions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs of now we\u2019re optimistic that stocks will sidestep the new variant worries, but we recommend investors buckle up their seatbelts, as the end of 2021 could be a bumpy one.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here are six things to think about as we head into the jolliest month of them all.\n\n&gt; First, historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 1.5% on average in December, which is the third best month of the year with only April and November better. But as you can see here, over the past 10 years, December has been much weaker. Of course, much of this was due to a huge 9.2% drop in 2018 (which we\u2019ll get to soon enough).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, some more good news is December has been up 74.3% of the time, more than any other month of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-2-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; drop in 2018. Only once in history was December the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500 and it was indeed in 2018. Three times it was the second worst month of the year, in 1968, 1980, and 1996. The worst monthly return so far this year was a 4.8% drop in September.\n\n&gt; Fourth, stocks usually don\u2019t get moving until the second half of the month, right as the holiday good feel vibes start to come out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Fifth, this year is in rare air, as all 11 months have made a new all-time high so far. Should the S&amp;P 500 make new highs in December that would be a perfect 12 for 12, matching 2014 as the only years to complete this incredible feat.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sixth, as we show in the LPL Chart of the Day, it turns out that when stocks are up more than 20% for the year heading into December (like 2021), the final month actually does better, up 1.7% versus 1.5%. Also, it has been higher eight of the past nine times the year was up more than 20% heading into the final month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Came Up Short in November\n\n&gt; The domestic economy added just 210,000 jobs during November, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus forecast for a gain of 550,000 and below October\u2019s revised tally of 546,000. The net revision to prior months was positive but only by 82,000.\n\n&gt; The modest 23,000 gain in leisure and hospitality jobs, which were up 170,000 in October, and a 20,000 drop in retail jobs don\u2019t make much sense given solid retail sales data of late. That could set up a positive reversal from revisions next month, though that potential bump will play some tug-of-war with the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, which came after the November survey period ended.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, for the past four months the pace of job gains has been well below the pre-Delta variant levels of near 1 million back in June and July. However, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic that job growth picks up in early 2022, assuming the Omicron variant doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe job growth number is disappointing, no doubt, especially considering the survey period fell before we even know the name of the newest Covid-19 variant,\u201d noted LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile Omicron may curb hiring a bit over the next month or two, we remain confident in our expectation for strong job gains and above-average growth in the U.S. economy in 2022.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-12.3.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The story was clearly better when looking at the unemployment rate, derived from the household survey rather than from employers. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell from 4.6% to 4.2% in November as workers\u2014in an encouraging sign\u2014came off the sidelines (1.14 million of them), lifting the participation rate by 0.2% to 61.8%, a post-recession high but still well off pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&gt; Inflation data also painted a somewhat reassuring picture. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings rose less than expected at 4.8% (+0.3% month over month), below consensus expectations of 5.0% and 0.4%, and not enough to keep up with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the increase in labor participation helped limit wage increases, but we have a long way to go there still. The labor market is still 3.9 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels and the labor market remains under-supplied, as noted above. In other words, further improvement in participation will still be needed to help contain inflation pressure.\n\n&gt; Some will argue that this report will make the Federal Reserve (Fed) think twice before accelerating tapering of its bond purchases, but we\u2019re not so sure.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere were a number of positives with this jobs report,\u201d explained LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. \u201cLabor force participation increased and the unemployment rate fell\u2014both of which point to a continued strong jobs market. That may give the Fed reasons to speed up its tapering plans.\u201d\n\n&gt; Overall, this report is a disappointing reminder that we\u2019re going to have to wait longer for the booming jobs numbers that we still expect to see. We continue to expect more people to get back to work in the months ahead, in an environment of strong labor demand, which can help alleviate wage pressure and firm up the economic growth outlook. Omicron is a risk but based on the information we have today, we do not expect that variant, or any others, to meaningfully slow the job market recovery in 2022.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 3rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.5.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$COUP $MDB $HQY $GTLB $SUMO $AZO $DBI $ALCO $CHPT $PLAY $SFIX $TOL $SOL $PD $S $CDMO $AVAV $LOVE $GME $RH $PATH $GEF $OXM $CHWY $LULU $COST $ORCL $AVGO $MTN $KLXE $KSPN $ASO**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/r0gUrDf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/evjwA2L.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/br3K0zL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hbGoBFe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.7.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tM8wghC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hhcFlGr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lPByiPr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FNjpxcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2PUPQhA.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6kqQxly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/OcHR8nI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.),\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",

        "selftext": "\nOne of the most interesting rebuttals to bears pointing out the obvious flaws and bad price action in ARK is \u201cbuy the dip because Cathie Wood said this is a 5 year plan\u201d. This sounds great in theory and probably calms the bag holders at night, but realistically it\u2019s horrible advice. \n\nIn 2000 dot com bubble, people who were buying every stock with dot com at the end probably thought it was a good idea. In fact, when the bubble popped and many investors kept averaging down, they probably had the same thought. It\u2019ll go back up in 5 years anyways, right? Wrong. From the peak of the tech bubble, it took the NASDAQ nearly 12 years to return back to where it was. Even if you picked the top of the cream, let\u2019s say Microsoft - MSFT did not return to its peak 2000 price again until 2010. So, saying everything is a 5 year plan and you\u2019ll be a millionaire in 2026 is great, until you\u2019re stuck holding a stock or in this case, ETF, for 10 years in the red. \n\nWhat makes all of this worse is that Cathie Wood trades daily. One of the reason indexes tend to go up is because the winners tend to occupy larger and larger percentages of the index over time. For example, there could be a company today that\u2019s only a small percentage of the index but if the company continues to perform strongly and the stock goes up, it becomes a larger portion of the index, thus benefiting the index holder. But Cathie doesn\u2019t let that natural process take place. She constantly sells Tesla on up days to dilute her funds with other stocks, that may not be nearly as strong. This destroys the entire purpose of a 5 year plan. \n\nBuyer beware on ARK and if you\u2019re a bag holder, probably a good idea to sell. Good luck to all.",

        "selftext": " **Trying to wrap my mind around this: About a year ago, TDOC finalized the buying of Livongo for 18.3B. Now TDOC is worth around 15B.**\n\nI was \"forced\" into TDOC because of that, as my shares were transferred to TDOC. Was around 150% up in LVGO, but missed the merger date so was not able to sell my LVGO shares on time. TDOC then picked up a bit of momentum in early 2021, reaching an ATH of 308 in February. Now trading around 92/93, that is a 70% decline in 8 months! I kept on buying the \"dips\" since February, now holding 455 shares at 149$, -35% down (-22.5K$)\n\nAmazing how things could change that much within a year! This is even wild in the K\\*R\\*Y\\*P\\*T\\*O market.....\n\nAnd the sad thing is, even if there comes a stellar q4 ER report, the stock may go up 10% or so, no more..... but to break even, I need 53% runup... And there maybe even more desperate souls out there that have bought near ATH that need like 250% runup to break even...\n\nAlso strange that the stock is plunging even on those days the covid variant FUD is lifting some covid play stocks like ZM and PLTON. The recent sell off of some growth stock (E.g. NET, SE, ) could be attributed to profit taking as they have rallied pretty hard this year, which is the opposite of TDOC...\n\nI read a recent article from Seeking A\\* entitled \"Teladoc: Understanding The Difference Between A Broken Company And A Broken Stock\", that comforted me a bit, sharing the highlights here below:\n\n**TLDR**\n\n**T*****eladoc shareholders had a rough couple of months as shares declined by more than 40% YTD and are down roughly 60% from all-time highs in February.***\n\n***Telehealth has seen rapid uptake during the pandemic and utilization rates continue to be more than 30-times higher than pre-pandemic.***\n\n***McKinsey estimated that telehealth could become a &gt;$250bn annual market opportunity in the US alone.***\n\n***Teladoc has pioneered the telehealth industry and has shown strong operating performance while many competitors are failing to keep up.***\n\n***The big question is if the stock can shake off the negative sentiment as a Covid stock and reverse its downtrend. We believe it can.***\n\n***In our view, investors are currently factoring in too much negativity with Teladoc. We believe that the company's future will be driven by the inevitable adoption of virtual care delivery which will help to eliminate major healthcare resource constraints, especially for physician visits and chronic disease management. Remember that the Telehealth market in the US alone is estimated to be a quarter-trillion dollar opportunity at some point. With the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care, near-virtual office visits, virtual home health services, as well as tech-enabled home medication administration, Teladoc seems perfectly positioned to capture a significant share of this market as it continues to build out its multitude of services. We believe Teladoc should be able to address up to 80% of the market opportunity with its services.***\n\n***It is important to highlight that the telehealth market is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality perception, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. The global telehealth market was valued at 62.5 billion USD in 2020 and forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026. North America remains by far the largest market as the US market revenue crossed USD 36.6bn in 2020. The US market is expected to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of &gt;$150 billion by 2026.***\n\n***There is no doubt that Teladoc will likely continue to grow its business at a significant pace, albeit at slower rates than during the heights of the pandemic. In our view the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable. At the same time, management's forecast for &gt;$4bn in revenue by 2024 means the company will at least double its current revenues within 3 years which is a strong sign of confidence. We believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors.***\n\n***Article (without figures)***\n\nThere is a big difference between a broken company and a broken stock and being able to make returns in a selloff requires understanding the difference between the two. When the market or a particular sector suffers huge losses, investors have an opportunity to buy good companies that have taken an unfair beating at attractive prices. We believe Teladoc (TDOC) provides such an opportunity given its leadership position in a secular growth industry. When speaking about telehealth, the first company that actually comes to mind is Teladoc as it has pioneered the rise of the telehealth market to a large extent, which was further accelerated by the pandemic.\n\nTeladoc shares entered 2020 just above $80 per share. The share price shot higher amidst increased demand for virtual healthcare delivery as the pandemic hit the world. Shares reached an all-time high in the beginning of 2021 around $300. Since the end of February, shares are in a continuous downtrend and are down more than 40% YTD and around 60% since its all-time highs in February, compared to a 25% YTD gain for the S&amp;P 500.\n\nAnd while the company continued to report strong growth rates, investors seem concerned about the sustainability of the company's growth and path to profitability. Teladoc posted another set of strong topline growth rates in its most recent quarter, while also boosting its full-year revenue guidance. Management also provided a longer-term outlook until 2024 at its most recent investor day calling for &gt;$4bn in revenue, representing a CAGR between 25 to 30%.\n\nBut that seemingly isn't enough to please investors and reverse the downtrend. While the outlook anticipates strong sustained growth, the growth rate is far lower compared to last year. In our view, the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable in light of the re-opening of economies across the globe. Nevertheless, Teladoc's 2024 forecast means the company will continue its strong path of growth (albeit at slower rates) and will at least double its current revenues within 3 years.\n\nWe believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors that may want to participate in this secular growth industry.\n\nThis article will look at Teladoc's most recent financial performance, outlook and will put things into context of the current state of telehealth globally. Let's start with the latter.\n\nThe Current State of Telehealth\n\nTelehealth is seeing a historically high consumer demand that keeps to be significantly higher than pre-Covid-pandemic levels. While telehealth was rather perceived as a commodity, the pandemic has shown that it became an essential part of our everyday lives. It has become a necessity, an important bridge to allow patients to continue to receive necessary care. Telehealth has enabled to eliminate major healthcare system constraints, e.g., hospital beds and physician visiting hours that were needed for taking care of Covid patients while capacities for regular in-patient visits in chronic or mental care were almost completely eliminated.\n\nOn the basis of a recent study by McKinsey, Teladoc estimates that the opportunity for telehealth adoption in the US alone could represent up to $261 billion.\n\nIt is important to highlight that this opportunity still needs to be fully realized as the industry is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. In 2020 the global telehealth market was valued at $62.45 billion and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026, and North America crossed $36.6 billion in annual spend. Analysts are expecting the US market to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of &gt;$150 billion by 2026.\n\nWith this huge opportunity in mind, where do we stand today?\n\nOverall, there are 3 key enablers that determine the future market growth: 1) consumer demand and acceptance, 2) provider willingness and ability to offer telehealth on a more regular basis, and 3) regulatory changes supporting necessary access and reimbursement.\n\nIn terms of consumer demand, a McKinsey report showed that, in April 2020, right after the COVID pandemic hit the world, telehealth utilization was 78 times higher than in February 2020.\n\nNow that the pandemic is having less of an impact as vaccines have become widely available, and lockdown restrictions are being lifted, telehealth use is still at significantly higher levels than pre-pandemic. Telehealth utilization has now stabilized at levels 38X higher vs. pre-pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, more than 32% of office and outpatient visits were occurring via telehealth in April 2020. Now utilization levels have largely stabilized with up to 17% of all outpatient/office-based visits being delivered virtually or virtually-enabled.\n\nDespite the relatively higher overall utilization rates compared to pre-pandemic levels, there is still a high level of variation with respect to the point of care and specialties where telehealth is being provided, with mental health services and endocrinology being in the top 3 of service modalities as of February 2021. Similarly, perception of telehealth usage has continuously improved. Around half of the consumers intend to continue to use telehealth going forward, up from 11% prior to COVID-19. This is in line with what Teladoc reported during its most recent Investor Day Presentation.\n\nHowever, there is still some concern, especially on the consumer side on the quality, safety and accessibility of the technology, the latter being especially true for elderly people. Telehealth care delivery models are likely to adapt to such barriers by means of extending their platform offerings from fully virtual care delivery to offering also hybrid virtual and technology enabled in-person care delivery to really break down such barriers.\n\nOn the provider side, McKinsey suggests that more than half (58%) of doctors view telehealth more favorably now than they did before the COVID pandemic. Looking at actual utilization, 84% of doctors are now offering virtual visits. It has become clear, however, that costs of care delivery and reimbursement regulations are important aspects to consider moving forward.\n\nAlso, from a regulatory standpoint, things have progressed in favor of making telehealth a permanent care delivery option, enabling access and reimbursement for a range of telehealth services. For example, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services have expanded coverage on reimbursable telehealth services in the 2021 physician fee schedule final rule.\n\nInvestments in virtual healthcare have skyrocketed lately, with 3 times the level of venture investment in 2020 vs. 2017. Per Rock Health's H1 2021 digital health funding report 10 the total venture capital investment into the digital health space in the first half of 2021 totaled $14.6 billion, nearly twice the investment from 2019 ($7.7 billion).\n\n*Is Telehealth here to stay?*\n\nAs we continue to move out of the pandemic into a more normalized healthcare delivery environment, there is no doubt that telehealth will remain an important component of healthcare delivery, supported by improved customer and provider perceptions, regulatory improvements, and a broadening of access to and coverage of services. Further broad-based adoption will require that providers and regulators work closely together to address some of the still imminent barriers, especially integrating virtually enabled services into the day-to-day routine of clinicians to enable hybrid care models.\n\nOne last point to note is that telehealth still remains a highly fragmented industry. This creates two important necessities: first, there is a clear need for a better and more holistic value proposition by means of a whole-person care approach where services from multiple disciplines are integrated to provide the best customer experience. From an industry perspective, this means that consolidation is inevitable to achieve this necessary level of integration.\n\nThis brings us to the most important conclusion: telehealth will likely be a winner takes most industry and only a few relevant players will be able to scale their services and will take most of the market opportunity. McKinsey estimated that up to $250 billion in annual healthcare spend could be up for grab, with the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care ($35bn), near-virtual office visits ($39 bn), and virtual home health services ($35 bn), as well as an additional $12bn in tech-enabled home medication administration.\n\nWhat does it mean for Teladoc?\n\nWith the above in mind, it becomes obvious that Teladoc has positioned itself as the leader to capture the significant market opportunity in virtual care delivery as its services address almost every area of virtual care delivery.\n\nAlso in terms of its provider network, Teladoc is already operating at a significant scale with its network of more than 10 thousand care providers and more than 76 Mio members as of Q3 2021. And management sees a long runway of member growth ahead with currently 92 Mio people (\\~31% of insured lives in the U.S.) having access to a Teladoc product, and \\~63 Mio additional potential customers to grab from existing clients, managed care organizations and Medicare &amp; Medicaid Fee-for-Service lives.\n\nManagement also believes that the opportunity across the 92 Mio individuals who currently have access to one of its services constitutes at least a $75bn annual revenue opportunity, with significant upside to $137bn if customers would opt for multi-product adoption across Teladoc's services portfolio.\n\nBelow is an illustration on how multi-product adoption by an employer with 10,000 customers may lead to 4.1x higher revenues vs. a single condition product adoption. This is an important aspect to keep in mind as medical conditions do not occur in isolation, and for example, 40% of Americans live with two or more chronic conditions (like diabetes and hypertension) in parallel and would benefit from an integrated care delivery approach. Teladoc's solutions can offer exactly what is needed and can reinforce each other to drive broader engagement across the platform.\n\nAnd Teladoc is in a leading position to make whole-person virtual care delivery a reality, especially through its Primary360 platform, which functions as the gateway to enabling fully integrated whole-person care delivery. Management estimates that around 80% of the US population could benefit from one of its primary care services under the Primary360 platform, with the total addressable market for managing Diabetes and Hypertension alone representing a $47bn opportunity.\n\nIts ability to penetrate the increasing customer need for virtual care delivery solutions is also reflected in the most recent quarterly numbers. For Q3 2021, Teladoc reported:\n\nRevenue growth of 81% YoY to $522 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $67.4 million, growing by 71% YoY.\n\nRevenue growth was driven by +99% YoY growth in access fees revenue and +18% YoY growth in visit fee revenue. Growth in the US came in at 89% vs. 17% growth for international geographies. The difference between US and international is partly historical but was also impacted by the acquisition of Livongo, which is only available to US customers at the moment.\n\nTotal visits for the quarter reached 3.9M at a 37% YoY growth rate, showing an acceleration from around 28% growth in the previous quarter, and driven by a 40% increase in US visits vs. 19% growth for international visits.\n\nU.S. Paid Members gained \\~2% YoY in Q3, which is a deceleration from the prior-year growth. However, it is good to see that Paid Members and PMPM (per member per month) fees are continuing to trend upwards in parallel as both are two important metrics that together will drive topline growth moving forward.\n\nMost importantly the percentage of chronic care members enrolled in more than one program has grown 3x year-over-year to 24% in the most recent quarter, while more than 40% of telehealth members have access to multiple products compared to less than 10% in 2017.\n\nLooking at profitability, net loss for Q3 more than doubled from the prior-year quarter to reach $84.3M. The lack of profitability is one of the most frequently raised concerns by investors and deserves a look under the surface. Net loss for Q3 was mainly driven by stock-based compensation (SBC), mostly in relation to the recent Livongo acquisition. Teladoc actually reported positive adjusted EBITDA when excluding SBC (which accounted for 85% of the quarter's net loss) and some other smaller items.\n\nThe impact from SBC on profitability is expected to decrease over the coming quarters, and when it does we expect Teladoc to make significant steps towards GAAP profitability.\n\nIrrespective of this Teladoc is already showing its cash-generating potential as the company posted a positive operating cash flow of $111 million over the past 9 months, which increased the overall cash position to $823.8M.\n\nGoss margins remained in line with previous quarters, but adjusted EBITDA margins showed a slight decrease in Q3 vs. prior quarters.\n\nTeladoc also boosted its 2021 revenue outlook to between $2.015 to $2.025 billion, compared to \\~$2.0B analyst consensus, indicating a \\~85% YoY growth at the midpoint. The company also boosted its guidance for total visits to 14.5 to 14.7 Mio, implying 37% to 39% growth, up from the prior guidance of 13.5 to 14.0 Mio visits.\n\nDuring its investor day management also provided a longer-term outlook for 2024 and expects to generate in excess of $4bn in revenue in FY 2024, implying between 25-30% compounded annual revenue growth throughout 2024.\n\nIn our view, the 2024 forecast is quite impressive as it means the company will at least double its current FY 21 revenues within 3 years, at scale, which is a strong sign of confidence by management.\n\n*So What?*\n\nNow, there are several concerns by investors that keep weighing on the stock despite strong continued growth. Most importantly, investors fear that Teladoc's growth rates cannot be sustained. This is a valid concern which is already visible in many of Teladoc's metrics, including:\n\nRevenue growth, where the growth rate declined to 81% in Q3 from 109% in Q2 2021. And while the revenue outlook for FY 2021 indicates a robust 85% growth rate (vs. 98% YoY growth in 2020), it's probably the 2022 outlook that surprised investors where management provided a preliminary outlook of $2.6bn in FY22 revenue, implying only 28-29% growth vs. FY 2021.\n\nThe growth deceleration is also visible in the customer metrics as U.S. Paid Members came in at \\~2% YoY growth, a deceleration from 41% growth for FY 2020, and 20% YoY growth in Q1 2021.\n\nThere are two additional concerns that weigh on the stock: one is the above-mentioned concern on profitability. On the surface, Teladoc's net loss during the past nine months increased roughly 4-fold compared to the first nine months of 2020 with current 9-month net loss of $(417.8) million compared to $(91.2) million for the first 9 months of 2020. However, as outlined above, most of this is driven by SBC in relation to the Livongo acquisition which should have a declining impact moving forward.\n\nLastly, there is competition, which is trying to eat away Teladoc's lunch. Competitors like Amwell (AMWL) continue to expand their services which could become a threat to Teladoc in the fight for market share. In addition, big players are also expanding their telehealth capabilities, e.g. insurer Cigna (NYSE:CI) through its acquisition of MDLive, or Amazon (AMZN) who is significantly expanding its Amazon Care ambition. It's important to highlight again that the market is still very fragmented but only a few have achieved to operate at significant scale, including Teladoc. And Teladoc continues to expand its service offerings, including its recently launched mental health service myStrength Complete, which integrates capabilities to deliver comprehensive virtual mental care delivery, which were shown to have the highest penetration rates at the moment (see McKinsey data above).\n\nTeladoc is further expanding in the US but also internationally which is key to maintaining and build out its leadership position:\n\nIn Q3, Teladoc has signed new agreements with CVS Health and Centene to on Teladoc's Health's Primary360 platform.\n\nTeladoc was selected as a vendor by Canada Health Infoway for its whole-person care services, which serve approximately 60% of Canada's population.\n\nAnnounced a strategic partnership with Philips to deliver virtual healthcare solutions in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSigned an agreement with giant Latin American telecom company Telefonica, which expands the existing partnership to make Teladoc's services available to over 60 million people in Brazil.\n\nAnnounced a collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT) to integrate Teladoc's solo platform for health systems into Microsoft Teams to streamline clinician workflows into a unified experience.\n\nNot to forget, in midst of the pandemic Teladoc made a key strategic acquisition with Livongo, a leader in the virtual diabetes and chronic disease management space, which gave the company access to key technological properties that are now leveraged within other services, including the recently launched mental health service, myStrength Complete. The Livongo contribution is paying off nicely as member data points continued to increase significantly, showing over 100% YoY growth to 1.99 billion (cumulative).\n\nAll of this also contributed to the fact that Teladoc ranked highest among direct-to-consumer providers in the J.D. Power 2021 U.S. Telehealth Satisfaction Study nearly 30 points above the category average, outperforming all other providers. Teladoc is continuing to provide industry-leading quality of services while expanding geographically and from a product-offerings perspective which is key to maintaining its leadership position moving forward.",

        "selftext": "So, I\u2019ve had some mutual funds in my retirement portfolio for years. The returns have been pretty good (in line with the S&amp;P 500). I keep asking myself, Why am I paying $100/yr in expense ratios (0.6% for American Funds Growth Fund of America (AGTHX)) so some portfolio managers with very hittable faces (Seriously! Check out Julian and Christopher.) can can get paid millions of dollars to buy what? TSLA, MSFT, NFLX, FB, GOOG, and AMZN? Those stocks make up 1/3 of the fund\u2019s portfolio! And they\u2019re only turning over less than a quarter of the fund every year. When I first threw money at the fund, retail investing had fees for every trade and limited access to certain stocks (e.g., pink sheets). Am I an idiot for continuing to throw my money at some Lamborghini-driving milennials with $10,000/month rent in Hell\u2019s Kitchen and a Hamptons house??",

        "selftext": " **Trying to wrap my mind around this: About a year ago, TDOC finalized the buying of Livongo for 18.3B. Now TDOC is worth around 15B.**\n\nI was \"forced\" into TDOC because of that, as my shares were transferred to TDOC. Was around 150% up in LVGO, but missed the merger date so was not able to sell my LVGO shares on time. TDOC then picked up a bit of momentum in early 2021, reaching an ATH of 308 in February. Now trading around 92/93, that is a 70% decline in 8 months! I kept on buying the \"dips\" since February, now holding 455 shares at 149$, -35% down (-22.5K$)\n\nAmazing how things could change that much within a year! This is even wild in the K\\*R\\*Y\\*P\\*T\\*O market.....\n\nAnd the sad thing is, even if there comes a stellar q4 ER report, the stock may go up 10% or so, no more..... but to break even, I need 53% runup... Also strange that the stock is plunging even on those days the covid variant FUD is lifting some covid play stocks like ZM and PLTON. The recent sell off of some growth stock (E.g. NET, SE, ) could be attributed to profit taking as they have rallied pretty hard this year, which is the opposite of TDOC...\n\nI read a recent article from Seeking A\\* entitled \"Teladoc: Understanding The Difference Between A Broken Company And A Broken Stock\", that comforted me a bit, sharing the highlights here below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\n**T*****eladoc shareholders had a rough couple of months as shares declined by more than 40% YTD and are down roughly 60% from all-time highs in February.***\n\n***Telehealth has seen rapid uptake during the pandemic and utilization rates continue to be more than 30-times higher than pre-pandemic.***\n\n***McKinsey estimated that telehealth could become a &gt;$250bn annual market opportunity in the US alone.***\n\n***Teladoc has pioneered the telehealth industry and has shown strong operating performance while many competitors are failing to keep up.***\n\n***The big question is if the stock can shake off the negative sentiment as a Covid stock and reverse its downtrend. We believe it can.***\n\n***In our view, investors are currently factoring in too much negativity with Teladoc. We believe that the company's future will be driven by the inevitable adoption of virtual care delivery which will help to eliminate major healthcare resource constraints, especially for physician visits and chronic disease management. Remember that the Telehealth market in the US alone is estimated to be a quarter-trillion dollar opportunity at some point. With the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care, near-virtual office visits, virtual home health services, as well as tech-enabled home medication administration, Teladoc seems perfectly positioned to capture a significant share of this market as it continues to build out its multitude of services. We believe Teladoc should be able to address up to 80% of the market opportunity with its services.***\n\n***It is important to highlight that the telehealth market is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality perception, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. The global telehealth market was valued at 62.5 billion USD in 2020 and forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026. North America remains by far the largest market as the US market revenue crossed USD 36.6bn in 2020. The US market is expected to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of &gt;$150 billion by 2026.***\n\n***There is no doubt that Teladoc will likely continue to grow its business at a significant pace, albeit at slower rates than during the heights of the pandemic. In our view the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable. At the same time, management's forecast for &gt;$4bn in revenue by 2024 means the company will at least double its current revenues within 3 years which is a strong sign of confidence. We believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Article (without figures)***\n\nThere is a big difference between a broken company and a broken stock and being able to make returns in a selloff requires understanding the difference between the two. When the market or a particular sector suffers huge losses, investors have an opportunity to buy good companies that have taken an unfair beating at attractive prices. We believe Teladoc (TDOC) provides such an opportunity given its leadership position in a secular growth industry. When speaking about telehealth, the first company that actually comes to mind is Teladoc as it has pioneered the rise of the telehealth market to a large extent, which was further accelerated by the pandemic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTeladoc shares entered 2020 just above $80 per share. The share price shot higher amidst increased demand for virtual healthcare delivery as the pandemic hit the world. Shares reached an all-time high in the beginning of 2021 around $300. Since the end of February, shares are in a continuous downtrend and are down more than 40% YTD and around 60% since its all-time highs in February, compared to a 25% YTD gain for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd while the company continued to report strong growth rates, investors seem concerned about the sustainability of the company's growth and path to profitability. Teladoc posted another set of strong topline growth rates in its most recent quarter, while also boosting its full-year revenue guidance. Management also provided a longer-term outlook until 2024 at its most recent investor day calling for &gt;$4bn in revenue, representing a CAGR between 25 to 30%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that seemingly isn't enough to please investors and reverse the downtrend. While the outlook anticipates strong sustained growth, the growth rate is far lower compared to last year. In our view, the return to more reasonable and sustainable growth rates was inevitable in light of the re-opening of economies across the globe. Nevertheless, Teladoc's 2024 forecast means the company will continue its strong path of growth (albeit at slower rates) and will at least double its current revenues within 3 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe believe that Teladoc can sustain these growth rates at least until 2026 and may be able to reach between $6.2 and $7.5 bn in revenues by 2026. At a current market cap of 18 billion, shares are starting to look quite attractive for long-term investors that may want to participate in this secular growth industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis article will look at Teladoc's most recent financial performance, outlook and will put things into context of the current state of telehealth globally. Let's start with the latter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Current State of Telehealth\n\nTelehealth is seeing a historically high consumer demand that keeps to be significantly higher than pre-Covid-pandemic levels. While telehealth was rather perceived as a commodity, the pandemic has shown that it became an essential part of our everyday lives. It has become a necessity, an important bridge to allow patients to continue to receive necessary care. Telehealth has enabled to eliminate major healthcare system constraints, e.g., hospital beds and physician visiting hours that were needed for taking care of Covid patients while capacities for regular in-patient visits in chronic or mental care were almost completely eliminated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the basis of a recent study by McKinsey, Teladoc estimates that the opportunity for telehealth adoption in the US alone could represent up to $261 billion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is important to highlight that this opportunity still needs to be fully realized as the industry is still in its infancy and subject to many barriers like accessibility, quality, as well as regulatory and partial reimbursement restrictions. In 2020 the global telehealth market was valued at $62.45 billion and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% until 2026, and North America crossed $36.6 billion in annual spend. Analysts are expecting the US market to grow at a CAGR of close to 30% until 2026 which would result in a market size of &gt;$150 billion by 2026.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith this huge opportunity in mind, where do we stand today?\n\nOverall, there are 3 key enablers that determine the future market growth: 1) consumer demand and acceptance, 2) provider willingness and ability to offer telehealth on a more regular basis, and 3) regulatory changes supporting necessary access and reimbursement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of consumer demand, a McKinsey report showed that, in April 2020, right after the COVID pandemic hit the world, telehealth utilization was 78 times higher than in February 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that the pandemic is having less of an impact as vaccines have become widely available, and lockdown restrictions are being lifted, telehealth use is still at significantly higher levels than pre-pandemic. Telehealth utilization has now stabilized at levels 38X higher vs. pre-pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, more than 32% of office and outpatient visits were occurring via telehealth in April 2020. Now utilization levels have largely stabilized with up to 17% of all outpatient/office-based visits being delivered virtually or virtually-enabled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite the relatively higher overall utilization rates compared to pre-pandemic levels, there is still a high level of variation with respect to the point of care and specialties where telehealth is being provided, with mental health services and endocrinology being in the top 3 of service modalities as of February 2021. Similarly, perception of telehealth usage has continuously improved. Around half of the consumers intend to continue to use telehealth going forward, up from 11% prior to COVID-19. This is in line with what Teladoc reported during its most recent Investor Day Presentation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, there is still some concern, especially on the consumer side on the quality, safety and accessibility of the technology, the latter being especially true for elderly people. Telehealth care delivery models are likely to adapt to such barriers by means of extending their platform offerings from fully virtual care delivery to offering also hybrid virtual and technology enabled in-person care delivery to really break down such barriers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the provider side, McKinsey suggests that more than half (58%) of doctors view telehealth more favorably now than they did before the COVID pandemic. Looking at actual utilization, 84% of doctors are now offering virtual visits. It has become clear, however, that costs of care delivery and reimbursement regulations are important aspects to consider moving forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, from a regulatory standpoint, things have progressed in favor of making telehealth a permanent care delivery option, enabling access and reimbursement for a range of telehealth services. For example, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services have expanded coverage on reimbursable telehealth services in the 2021 physician fee schedule final rule.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInvestments in virtual healthcare have skyrocketed lately, with 3 times the level of venture investment in 2020 vs. 2017. Per Rock Health's H1 2021 digital health funding report 10 the total venture capital investment into the digital health space in the first half of 2021 totaled $14.6 billion, nearly twice the investment from 2019 ($7.7 billion).\n\n*Is Telehealth here to stay?*\n\nAs we continue to move out of the pandemic into a more normalized healthcare delivery environment, there is no doubt that telehealth will remain an important component of healthcare delivery, supported by improved customer and provider perceptions, regulatory improvements, and a broadening of access to and coverage of services. Further broad-based adoption will require that providers and regulators work closely together to address some of the still imminent barriers, especially integrating virtually enabled services into the day-to-day routine of clinicians to enable hybrid care models.\n\nOne last point to note is that telehealth still remains a highly fragmented industry. This creates two important necessities: first, there is a clear need for a better and more holistic value proposition by means of a whole-person care approach where services from multiple disciplines are integrated to provide the best customer experience. From an industry perspective, this means that consolidation is inevitable to achieve this necessary level of integration.\n\nThis brings us to the most important conclusion: telehealth will likely be a winner takes most industry and only a few relevant players will be able to scale their services and will take most of the market opportunity. McKinsey estimated that up to $250 billion in annual healthcare spend could be up for grab, with the majority of that market coming from virtual physician office visits ($126 billion) and the remaining opportunity being equally distributed from virtual urgent care ($35bn), near-virtual office visits ($39 bn), and virtual home health services ($35 bn), as well as an additional $12bn in tech-enabled home medication administration.\n\nWhat does it mean for Teladoc?\n\nWith the above in mind, it becomes obvious that Teladoc has positioned itself as the leader to capture the significant market opportunity in virtual care delivery as its services address almost every area of virtual care delivery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso in terms of its provider network, Teladoc is already operating at a significant scale with its network of more than 10 thousand care providers and more than 76 Mio members as of Q3 2021. And management sees a long runway of member growth ahead with currently 92 Mio people (\\~31% of insured lives in the U.S.) having access to a Teladoc product, and \\~63 Mio additional potential customers to grab from existing clients, managed care organizations and Medicare &amp; Medicaid Fee-for-Service lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nManagement also believes that the opportunity across the 92 Mio individuals who currently have access to one of its services constitutes at least a $75bn annual revenue opportunity, with significant upside to $137bn if customers would opt for multi-product adoption across Teladoc's services portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow is an illustration on how multi-product adoption by an employer with 10,000 customers may lead to 4.1x higher revenues vs. a single condition product adoption. This is an important aspect to keep in mind as medical conditions do not occur in isolation, and for example, 40% of Americans live with two or more chronic conditions (like diabetes and hypertension) in parallel and would benefit from an integrated care delivery approach. Teladoc's solutions can offer exactly what is needed and can reinforce each other to drive broader engagement across the platform.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd Teladoc is in a leading position to make whole-person virtual care delivery a reality, especially through its Primary360 platform, which functions as the gateway to enabling fully integrated whole-person care delivery. Management estimates that around 80% of the US population could benefit from one of its primary care services under the Primary360 platform, with the total addressable market for managing Diabetes and Hypertension alone representing a $47bn opportunity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts ability to penetrate the increasing customer need for virtual care delivery solutions is also reflected in the most recent quarterly numbers. For Q3 2021, Teladoc reported:\n\nRevenue growth of 81% YoY to $522 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $67.4 million, growing by 71% YoY.\n\nRevenue growth was driven by +99% YoY growth in access fees revenue and +18% YoY growth in visit fee revenue. Growth in the US came in at 89% vs. 17% growth for international geographies. The difference between US and international is partly historical but was also impacted by the acquisition of Livongo, which is only available to US customers at the moment.\n\nTotal visits for the quarter reached 3.9M at a 37% YoY growth rate, showing an acceleration from around 28% growth in the previous quarter, and driven by a 40% increase in US visits vs. 19% growth for international visits.\n\nU.S. Paid Members gained \\~2% YoY in Q3, which is a deceleration from the prior-year growth. However, it is good to see that Paid Members and PMPM (per member per month) fees are continuing to trend upwards in parallel as both are two important metrics that together will drive topline growth moving forward.\n\nMost importantly the percentage of chronic care members enrolled in more than one program has grown 3x year-over-year to 24% in the most recent quarter, while more than 40% of telehealth members have access to multiple products compared to less than 10% in 2017.\n\nLooking at profitability, net loss for Q3 more than doubled from the prior-year quarter to reach $84.3M. The lack of profitability is one of the most frequently raised concerns by investors and deserves a look under the surface. Net loss for Q3 was mainly driven by stock-based compensation (SBC), mostly in relation to the recent Livongo acquisition. Teladoc actually reported positive adjusted EBITDA when excluding SBC (which accounted for 85% of the quarter's net loss) and some other smaller items.\n\nThe impact from SBC on profitability is expected to decrease over the coming quarters, and when it does we expect Teladoc to make significant steps towards GAAP profitability.\n\nIrrespective of this Teladoc is already showing its cash-generating potential as the company posted a positive operating cash flow of $111 million over the past 9 months, which increased the overall cash position to $823.8M.\n\nGoss margins remained in line with previous quarters, but adjusted EBITDA margins showed a slight decrease in Q3 vs. prior quarters.\n\nTeladoc also boosted its 2021 revenue outlook to between $2.015 to $2.025 billion, compared to \\~$2.0B analyst consensus, indicating a \\~85% YoY growth at the midpoint. The company also boosted its guidance for total visits to 14.5 to 14.7 Mio, implying 37% to 39% growth, up from the prior guidance of 13.5 to 14.0 Mio visits.\n\nDuring its investor day management also provided a longer-term outlook for 2024 and expects to generate in excess of $4bn in revenue in FY 2024, implying between 25-30% compounded annual revenue growth throughout 2024.\n\nIn our view, the 2024 forecast is quite impressive as it means the company will at least double its current FY 21 revenues within 3 years, at scale, which is a strong sign of confidence by management.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*So What?*\n\nNow, there are several concerns by investors that keep weighing on the stock despite strong continued growth. Most importantly, investors fear that Teladoc's growth rates cannot be sustained. This is a valid concern which is already visible in many of Teladoc's metrics, including:\n\nRevenue growth, where the growth rate declined to 81% in Q3 from 109% in Q2 2021. And while the revenue outlook for FY 2021 indicates a robust 85% growth rate (vs. 98% YoY growth in 2020), it's probably the 2022 outlook that surprised investors where management provided a preliminary outlook of $2.6bn in FY22 revenue, implying only 28-29% growth vs. FY 2021.\n\nThe growth deceleration is also visible in the customer metrics as U.S. Paid Members came in at \\~2% YoY growth, a deceleration from 41% growth for FY 2020, and 20% YoY growth in Q1 2021.\n\nThere are two additional concerns that weigh on the stock: one is the above-mentioned concern on profitability. On the surface, Teladoc's net loss during the past nine months increased roughly 4-fold compared to the first nine months of 2020 with current 9-month net loss of $(417.8) million compared to $(91.2) million for the first 9 months of 2020. However, as outlined above, most of this is driven by SBC in relation to the Livongo acquisition which should have a declining impact moving forward.\n\nLastly, there is competition, which is trying to eat away Teladoc's lunch. Competitors like Amwell (AMWL) continue to expand their services which could become a threat to Teladoc in the fight for market share. In addition, big players are also expanding their telehealth capabilities, e.g. insurer Cigna (NYSE:CI) through its acquisition of MDLive, or Amazon (AMZN) who is significantly expanding its Amazon Care ambition. It's important to highlight again that the market is still very fragmented but only a few have achieved to operate at significant scale, including Teladoc. And Teladoc continues to expand its service offerings, including its recently launched mental health service myStrength Complete, which integrates capabilities to deliver comprehensive virtual mental care delivery, which were shown to have the highest penetration rates at the moment (see McKinsey data above).\n\nTeladoc is further expanding in the US but also internationally which is key to maintaining and build out its leadership position:\n\nIn Q3, Teladoc has signed new agreements with CVS Health and Centene to on Teladoc's Health's Primary360 platform.\n\nTeladoc was selected as a vendor by Canada Health Infoway for its whole-person care services, which serve approximately 60% of Canada's population.\n\nAnnounced a strategic partnership with Philips to deliver virtual healthcare solutions in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSigned an agreement with giant Latin American telecom company Telefonica, which expands the existing partnership to make Teladoc's services available to over 60 million people in Brazil.\n\nAnnounced a collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT) to integrate Teladoc's solo platform for health systems into Microsoft Teams to streamline clinician workflows into a unified experience.\n\nNot to forget, in midst of the pandemic Teladoc made a key strategic acquisition with Livongo, a leader in the virtual diabetes and chronic disease management space, which gave the company access to key technological properties that are now leveraged within other services, including the recently launched mental health service, myStrength Complete. The Livongo contribution is paying off nicely as member data points continued to increase significantly, showing over 100% YoY growth to 1.99 billion (cumulative).\n\nAll of this also contributed to the fact that Teladoc ranked highest among direct-to-consumer providers in the J.D. Power 2021 U.S. Telehealth Satisfaction Study nearly 30 points above the category average, outperforming all other providers. Teladoc is continuing to provide industry-leading quality of services while expanding geographically and from a product-offerings perspective which is key to maintaining its leadership position moving forward.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 6th, 2021.\n\n# **More turbulence could be ahead for stocks as investors weigh omicron and the Fed\u2019s next steps - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/stocks-could-face-more-turbulence-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Volatility could continue to plague markets after a week of violent swings that sent many stocks plummeting.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, investors await more news on the omicron Covid variant and another inflation report Friday that is expected to show consumer prices remain the hottest in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks sold off on worries about the omicron variant and concerns the Federal Reserve will move away from its easy policies and raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a Congressional panel Tuesday that the central bank will consider speeding up the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program when it meets Dec. 14 and 15. The Federal Reserve put its bond-purchasing program in place in early 2020 to prop up the economy during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a somewhat turbulent December because we probably need to wait for earnings season to get regrounded, back to fundamentals,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. \u201cFor as high as a lot of the ratios would suggest, price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, when you throw it into the hopper with interest rates and everything else, things aren\u2019t that bad. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re teetering on the edge of a cliff.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Ablin did say the comments from Powell were unnerving investors, who fear the Fed will also speed up interest rate hikes. Powell acknowledged he was wrong about inflation being \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, spooking investors. The bond purchases are now scheduled to end in June.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m not sure what investors\u2019 read on inflation is. Do they think the Fed is going to raise rates, get ahead of it too early and everything is going to roll over? Ever since Powell took \u2018transitory\u2019 out of his talk, investors have been somewhat off balance,\u201d said Ablin.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index or CPI for November is expected Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones predict it rose 0.6% on a monthly basis, or 6.7% year over year. That compares to a 0.9% gain in October, and a 6.2% jump year over year, the biggest move in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; # Risky names slammed\nHigh fliers and growth were among the hardest hit Friday, as investors bailed out of some of the riskiest stocks. As stocks plunged Friday, Treasury yields fell. Yields move opposite price, and the move was seen as a flight to safety. The 10-year note yield fell to 1.35%.\n*****\n&gt; The ARK Innovation ETF was down nearly 12.7% for the week. Most of the growth names in the fund plunged into bear market territory. \u201cI think investors have to keep in mind that\u2019s not a 15-week strategy. It\u2019s a 15-year strategy, as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d Ablin said.\n*****\n&gt; For the week, the small cap Russell 2000 was down nearly 4%, while the S&amp;P 500 was off just 1.2%. The worst performing major sector for the week was communications services, which includes internet companies. It was down 2.8%, followed by consumer discretionary, off 2.4%. Financials lost nearly 2%, and the S&amp;P technology sector was down 0.4% for the week. But on Friday, tech lost 1.7%.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve should be quiet in the week ahead. Fed officials traditionally do not make major speeches in the blackout period, which is the coming week, ahead of their Dec. 14 and 15 meeting. One exception is Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari who speaks Thursday at the Center for Indian Country Development Research Summit.\n*****\n&gt; Much of the focus will be on how the market itself is performing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEver since the Nov. 22 outside bearish day, all strength has been sold with lots of damage underneath the hood,\u201d said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. \u201cNow finally some of the leadership names are showing faulty action.\u201d He noted that both Microsoft and Apple were weaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMoney is not hiding in Amazon, Google, or Facebook. They haven\u2019t been special for weeks,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P closed below its 50-day moving average Friday, after closing below it Wednesday. The 50-day is at 4,544. That\u2019s a signal to some market technicians that the index is on the verge of breaking down. The 50-day moving average is the average closing price over the past 50 days, and is viewed as a momentum indicator.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBasically, it\u2019s effectively a retest of support because we had the relief rally [Thursday],\u201d said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies. She said the S&amp;P 500 needs to close below the 50-day for two consecutive days before the move is considered a breakdown.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe action in the high growth, high multiple names is not a good sign,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cWe do have some signs of downside exhaustion but not as widespread as I would hope. We\u2019re seeing some of the heavyweights, like Adobe for example, taking out levels like the 50-day moving averages.\u201d She said some of those big names have now joined the selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re just watching how bad it gets. Monday is going to be the tell,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cThat also gives it the weekend to settle... Extremes have gotten a little bit more extreme. Sentiment is the most oversold from a contrarian perspective since the October low.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/hk2QMMD.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/w6utI7X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N8u66xV.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tagANgL.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/t8zd2PY.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fEvF2Bm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ponrnUL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SqxThz0.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/r0gUrDf.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3QmNJUa.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sz567v5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/s9GIfxy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBWalJo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7EeMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small-Cap Corrections\n\n&gt; At the close on Wednesday (12/1), the small-cap Russell 2,000 had fallen 12.1% from its recent high on November 8th, leaving the index in \"correction\" territory. A market \"correction\" is a drop of 10%+ that was preceded by a rally of at least 10% on a closing basis. This correction for the Russell 2,000 is its 58th since data for the index begins in 1978. Below is a table showing prior corrections for the Russell. The average correction sees the index fall 18.35%, which is just shy of the 20% threshold for a \"bear market.\" The median correction is a little smaller at -15.4%. In terms of length, the average Russell correction has lasted 73 days, while the median is 62 days. For the current Russell 2,000 correction to reach average levels, it would need to fall another 7% from here, and it would come to an end on January 20th, 2022.\n\n&gt; In terms of extremes, the biggest correction that the Russell 2,000 has ever experienced was the 41.9% decline seen during the initial COVID Crash from 1/16/20 to 3/18/20. The longest correction lasted 397 days from 6/24/83 to 7/25/84. In terms of the shortest correction, there were two that lasted 3 days. One of those came during the Financial Crisis while the other happened last June.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/raycorrec.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak\n\n&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.\n\n&gt; This is what used to be known as the \u201cJanuary Effect:\u201d small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/84caf5990b652671445781962a51ee2f/b2ebb400780bd4c8-af/s500x750/1795f2bbf763fb254a002bda32bd9b217881240b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Cap Effect &amp; Santa Claus Rally\n\n&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n&gt; December is the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not all that likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen post-election years, December\u2019s ranking slip to #7 S&amp;P 500, #7 NASDAQ and DJIA #5. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, tend to have a field day in post-election-year Decembers. Since 1981, the Russell 2000 has lost ground three time in ten post-election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 2.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/64044be6e473181304fe66b98074cbde/5618185eea1cfe29-fe/s400x600/931f46ef694541cebb05ea5f3193a5faa1f6bc60.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on December 27 and lasts until the second trading day of 2022. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n&gt; Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 6 Things To Know About December And Omicron\n\n&gt; Here comes December, historically a pretty solid month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant wreaking havoc on markets. \u201cWhat a difference a week makes. A week ago stocks were at all-time highs and the economy was strong. Now all we have are uncertainties and questions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs of now we\u2019re optimistic that stocks will sidestep the new variant worries, but we recommend investors buckle up their seatbelts, as the end of 2021 could be a bumpy one.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here are six things to think about as we head into the jolliest month of them all.\n\n&gt; First, historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 1.5% on average in December, which is the third best month of the year with only April and November better. But as you can see here, over the past 10 years, December has been much weaker. Of course, much of this was due to a huge 9.2% drop in 2018 (which we\u2019ll get to soon enough).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, some more good news is December has been up 74.3% of the time, more than any other month of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-2-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; drop in 2018. Only once in history was December the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500 and it was indeed in 2018. Three times it was the second worst month of the year, in 1968, 1980, and 1996. The worst monthly return so far this year was a 4.8% drop in September.\n\n&gt; Fourth, stocks usually don\u2019t get moving until the second half of the month, right as the holiday good feel vibes start to come out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Fifth, this year is in rare air, as all 11 months have made a new all-time high so far. Should the S&amp;P 500 make new highs in December that would be a perfect 12 for 12, matching 2014 as the only years to complete this incredible feat.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sixth, as we show in the LPL Chart of the Day, it turns out that when stocks are up more than 20% for the year heading into December (like 2021), the final month actually does better, up 1.7% versus 1.5%. Also, it has been higher eight of the past nine times the year was up more than 20% heading into the final month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Came Up Short in November\n\n&gt; The domestic economy added just 210,000 jobs during November, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus forecast for a gain of 550,000 and below October\u2019s revised tally of 546,000. The net revision to prior months was positive but only by 82,000.\n\n&gt; The modest 23,000 gain in leisure and hospitality jobs, which were up 170,000 in October, and a 20,000 drop in retail jobs don\u2019t make much sense given solid retail sales data of late. That could set up a positive reversal from revisions next month, though that potential bump will play some tug-of-war with the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, which came after the November survey period ended.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, for the past four months the pace of job gains has been well below the pre-Delta variant levels of near 1 million back in June and July. However, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic that job growth picks up in early 2022, assuming the Omicron variant doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe job growth number is disappointing, no doubt, especially considering the survey period fell before we even know the name of the newest Covid-19 variant,\u201d noted LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile Omicron may curb hiring a bit over the next month or two, we remain confident in our expectation for strong job gains and above-average growth in the U.S. economy in 2022.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-12.3.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The story was clearly better when looking at the unemployment rate, derived from the household survey rather than from employers. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell from 4.6% to 4.2% in November as workers\u2014in an encouraging sign\u2014came off the sidelines (1.14 million of them), lifting the participation rate by 0.2% to 61.8%, a post-recession high but still well off pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&gt; Inflation data also painted a somewhat reassuring picture. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings rose less than expected at 4.8% (+0.3% month over month), below consensus expectations of 5.0% and 0.4%, and not enough to keep up with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the increase in labor participation helped limit wage increases, but we have a long way to go there still. The labor market is still 3.9 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels and the labor market remains under-supplied, as noted above. In other words, further improvement in participation will still be needed to help contain inflation pressure.\n\n&gt; Some will argue that this report will make the Federal Reserve (Fed) think twice before accelerating tapering of its bond purchases, but we\u2019re not so sure.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere were a number of positives with this jobs report,\u201d explained LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. \u201cLabor force participation increased and the unemployment rate fell\u2014both of which point to a continued strong jobs market. That may give the Fed reasons to speed up its tapering plans.\u201d\n\n&gt; Overall, this report is a disappointing reminder that we\u2019re going to have to wait longer for the booming jobs numbers that we still expect to see. We continue to expect more people to get back to work in the months ahead, in an environment of strong labor demand, which can help alleviate wage pressure and firm up the economic growth outlook. Omicron is a risk but based on the information we have today, we do not expect that variant, or any others, to meaningfully slow the job market recovery in 2022.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/r0gUrDf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/evjwA2L.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/br3K0zL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hbGoBFe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.7.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tM8wghC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hhcFlGr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lPByiPr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FNjpxcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2PUPQhA.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6kqQxly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/OcHR8nI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.),\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets. :)",

        "selftext": "\nOne of the most interesting rebuttals to bears pointing out the obvious flaws and bad price action in ARK is \u201cbuy the dip because Cathie Wood said this is a 5 year plan\u201d. This sounds great in theory and probably calms the bag holders at night, but realistically it\u2019s horrible advice. \n\nIn 2000 dot com bubble, people who were buying every stock with dot com at the end probably thought it was a good idea. In fact, when the bubble popped and many investors kept averaging down, they probably had the same thought. It\u2019ll go back up in 5 years anyways, right? Wrong. From the peak of the tech bubble, it took the NASDAQ nearly 12 years to return back to where it was. Even if you picked the top of the cream, let\u2019s say Microsoft - MSFT did not return to its peak 2000 price again until 2010. So, saying everything is a 5 year plan and you\u2019ll be a millionaire in 2026 is great, until you\u2019re stuck holding a stock or in this case, ETF, for 10 years in the red. \n\nWhat makes all of this worse is that Cathie Wood trades daily. One of the reason indexes tend to go up is because the winners tend to occupy larger and larger percentages of the index over time. For example, there could be a company today that\u2019s only a small percentage of the index but if the company continues to perform strongly and the stock goes up, it becomes a larger portion of the index, thus benefiting the index holder. But Cathie doesn\u2019t let that natural process take place. She constantly sells Tesla on up days to dilute her funds with other stocks, that may not be nearly as strong. This destroys the entire purpose of a 5 year plan. \n\nBuyer beware on ARK and if you\u2019re a bag holder, probably a good idea to sell. Good luck to all.",

I mean, we won\u2019t be seeing an \u2018everything rally\u2019 like we have seen the last two years especially. Already, we have seen those mid-cap tech stocks bleed as investors flock to the FAANG stocks. \n\nIf you look at the charts for the past two years or so, you\u2019ll see huge gains for practically every stock.

This is normal but because of the huge gains already, we won\u2019t see that repeat itself. That\u2019s what I mean by the end of the gravy train. \n\nHow much will rates go up and how quickly? No one knows. But it could have a huge effect on values. We have seen stocks just because of this Covid variant. Rates will shock the system and you\u2019ll have panic selling. \n\nI\u2019m going to keep buying into my SPY and QQQ ETFs, and with stocks I\u2019m sticking to tried and true - Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and Nvidia.

        "selftext": "Good Friday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 6th, 2021.\n\n# **More turbulence could be ahead for stocks as investors weigh omicron and the Fed\u2019s next steps - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/stocks-could-face-more-turbulence-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Volatility could continue to plague markets after a week of violent swings that sent many stocks plummeting.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, investors await more news on the omicron Covid variant and another inflation report Friday that is expected to show consumer prices remain the hottest in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks sold off on worries about the omicron variant and concerns the Federal Reserve will move away from its easy policies and raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a Congressional panel Tuesday that the central bank will consider speeding up the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program when it meets Dec. 14 and 15. The Federal Reserve put its bond-purchasing program in place in early 2020 to prop up the economy during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a somewhat turbulent December because we probably need to wait for earnings season to get regrounded, back to fundamentals,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. \u201cFor as high as a lot of the ratios would suggest, price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, when you throw it into the hopper with interest rates and everything else, things aren\u2019t that bad. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re teetering on the edge of a cliff.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Ablin did say the comments from Powell were unnerving investors, who fear the Fed will also speed up interest rate hikes. Powell acknowledged he was wrong about inflation being \u201ctransitory,\u201d or temporary, spooking investors. The bond purchases are now scheduled to end in June.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m not sure what investors\u2019 read on inflation is. Do they think the Fed is going to raise rates, get ahead of it too early and everything is going to roll over? Ever since Powell took \u2018transitory\u2019 out of his talk, investors have been somewhat off balance,\u201d said Ablin.\n*****\n&gt; The consumer price index or CPI for November is expected Friday morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones predict it rose 0.6% on a monthly basis, or 6.7% year over year. That compares to a 0.9% gain in October, and a 6.2% jump year over year, the biggest move in three decades.\n*****\n&gt; # Risky names slammed\nHigh fliers and growth were among the hardest hit Friday, as investors bailed out of some of the riskiest stocks. As stocks plunged Friday, Treasury yields fell. Yields move opposite price, and the move was seen as a flight to safety. The 10-year note yield fell to 1.35%.\n*****\n&gt; The ARK Innovation ETF was down nearly 12.7% for the week. Most of the growth names in the fund plunged into bear market territory. \u201cI think investors have to keep in mind that\u2019s not a 15-week strategy. It\u2019s a 15-year strategy, as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d Ablin said.\n*****\n&gt; For the week, the small cap Russell 2000 was down nearly 4%, while the S&amp;P 500 was off just 1.2%. The worst performing major sector for the week was communications services, which includes internet companies. It was down 2.8%, followed by consumer discretionary, off 2.4%. Financials lost nearly 2%, and the S&amp;P technology sector was down 0.4% for the week. But on Friday, tech lost 1.7%.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve should be quiet in the week ahead. Fed officials traditionally do not make major speeches in the blackout period, which is the coming week, ahead of their Dec. 14 and 15 meeting. One exception is Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari who speaks Thursday at the Center for Indian Country Development Research Summit.\n*****\n&gt; Much of the focus will be on how the market itself is performing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEver since the Nov. 22 outside bearish day, all strength has been sold with lots of damage underneath the hood,\u201d said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. \u201cNow finally some of the leadership names are showing faulty action.\u201d He noted that both Microsoft and Apple were weaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMoney is not hiding in Amazon, Google, or Facebook. They haven\u2019t been special for weeks,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P closed below its 50-day moving average Friday, after closing below it Wednesday. The 50-day is at 4,544. That\u2019s a signal to some market technicians that the index is on the verge of breaking down. The 50-day moving average is the average closing price over the past 50 days, and is viewed as a momentum indicator.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBasically, it\u2019s effectively a retest of support because we had the relief rally [Thursday],\u201d said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies. She said the S&amp;P 500 needs to close below the 50-day for two consecutive days before the move is considered a breakdown.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe action in the high growth, high multiple names is not a good sign,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cWe do have some signs of downside exhaustion but not as widespread as I would hope. We\u2019re seeing some of the heavyweights, like Adobe for example, taking out levels like the 50-day moving averages.\u201d She said some of those big names have now joined the selling.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re just watching how bad it gets. Monday is going to be the tell,\u201d said Stockton. \u201cThat also gives it the weekend to settle... Extremes have gotten a little bit more extreme. Sentiment is the most oversold from a contrarian perspective since the October low.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/hk2QMMD.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/w6utI7X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N8u66xV.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tagANgL.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/28oKFM3.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/t8zd2PY.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fEvF2Bm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ponrnUL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SqxThz0.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/r0gUrDf.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3QmNJUa.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/sz567v5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/s9GIfxy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zBWalJo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7EeMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small-Cap Corrections\n\n&gt; At the close on Wednesday (12/1), the small-cap Russell 2,000 had fallen 12.1% from its recent high on November 8th, leaving the index in \"correction\" territory. A market \"correction\" is a drop of 10%+ that was preceded by a rally of at least 10% on a closing basis. This correction for the Russell 2,000 is its 58th since data for the index begins in 1978. Below is a table showing prior corrections for the Russell. The average correction sees the index fall 18.35%, which is just shy of the 20% threshold for a \"bear market.\" The median correction is a little smaller at -15.4%. In terms of length, the average Russell correction has lasted 73 days, while the median is 62 days. For the current Russell 2,000 correction to reach average levels, it would need to fall another 7% from here, and it would come to an end on January 20th, 2022.\n\n&gt; In terms of extremes, the biggest correction that the Russell 2,000 has ever experienced was the 41.9% decline seen during the initial COVID Crash from 1/16/20 to 3/18/20. The longest correction lasted 397 days from 6/24/83 to 7/25/84. In terms of the shortest correction, there were two that lasted 3 days. One of those came during the Financial Crisis while the other happened last June.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/raycorrec.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Typically Starts Out Weak\n\n&gt; December typically starts out weak as tax-loss selling ramps up and with the big gains this year we would expect that early December weakness to materialize. Then as you can see in the typical December chart here stocks begin to takeoff around mid-month led by small caps and the Russell 2000.\n\n&gt; This is what used to be known as the \u201cJanuary Effect:\u201d small caps outperforming large caps in the month of January. Nowadays most of the so-called January Effect takes place in the last half of December (2021 Almanac pages 110 &amp; 112, 2022 pages 112 &amp; 114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2021 Almanac page 16, 2022 page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/84caf5990b652671445781962a51ee2f/b2ebb400780bd4c8-af/s500x750/1795f2bbf763fb254a002bda32bd9b217881240b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # December Almanac: Small Cap Effect &amp; Santa Claus Rally\n\n&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n&gt; December is the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It\u2019s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not all that likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.\n\n&gt; In the last seventeen post-election years, December\u2019s ranking slip to #7 S&amp;P 500, #7 NASDAQ and DJIA #5. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, tend to have a field day in post-election-year Decembers. Since 1981, the Russell 2000 has lost ground three time in ten post-election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 2.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/64044be6e473181304fe66b98074cbde/5618185eea1cfe29-fe/s400x600/931f46ef694541cebb05ea5f3193a5faa1f6bc60.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on December 27 and lasts until the second trading day of 2022. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n&gt; Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 6 Things To Know About December And Omicron\n\n&gt; Here comes December, historically a pretty solid month for stocks, but now we have the Omicron variant wreaking havoc on markets. \u201cWhat a difference a week makes. A week ago stocks were at all-time highs and the economy was strong. Now all we have are uncertainties and questions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs of now we\u2019re optimistic that stocks will sidestep the new variant worries, but we recommend investors buckle up their seatbelts, as the end of 2021 could be a bumpy one.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here are six things to think about as we head into the jolliest month of them all.\n\n&gt; First, historically, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 1.5% on average in December, which is the third best month of the year with only April and November better. But as you can see here, over the past 10 years, December has been much weaker. Of course, much of this was due to a huge 9.2% drop in 2018 (which we\u2019ll get to soon enough).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Second, some more good news is December has been up 74.3% of the time, more than any other month of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-2-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; drop in 2018. Only once in history was December the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500 and it was indeed in 2018. Three times it was the second worst month of the year, in 1968, 1980, and 1996. The worst monthly return so far this year was a 4.8% drop in September.\n\n&gt; Fourth, stocks usually don\u2019t get moving until the second half of the month, right as the holiday good feel vibes start to come out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Fifth, this year is in rare air, as all 11 months have made a new all-time high so far. Should the S&amp;P 500 make new highs in December that would be a perfect 12 for 12, matching 2014 as the only years to complete this incredible feat.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sixth, as we show in the LPL Chart of the Day, it turns out that when stocks are up more than 20% for the year heading into December (like 2021), the final month actually does better, up 1.7% versus 1.5%. Also, it has been higher eight of the past nine times the year was up more than 20% heading into the final month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-post-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Came Up Short in November\n\n&gt; The domestic economy added just 210,000 jobs during November, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 consensus forecast for a gain of 550,000 and below October\u2019s revised tally of 546,000. The net revision to prior months was positive but only by 82,000.\n\n&gt; The modest 23,000 gain in leisure and hospitality jobs, which were up 170,000 in October, and a 20,000 drop in retail jobs don\u2019t make much sense given solid retail sales data of late. That could set up a positive reversal from revisions next month, though that potential bump will play some tug-of-war with the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, which came after the November survey period ended.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, for the past four months the pace of job gains has been well below the pre-Delta variant levels of near 1 million back in June and July. However, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic that job growth picks up in early 2022, assuming the Omicron variant doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe job growth number is disappointing, no doubt, especially considering the survey period fell before we even know the name of the newest Covid-19 variant,\u201d noted LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile Omicron may curb hiring a bit over the next month or two, we remain confident in our expectation for strong job gains and above-average growth in the U.S. economy in 2022.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-pic-12.3.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The story was clearly better when looking at the unemployment rate, derived from the household survey rather than from employers. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell from 4.6% to 4.2% in November as workers\u2014in an encouraging sign\u2014came off the sidelines (1.14 million of them), lifting the participation rate by 0.2% to 61.8%, a post-recession high but still well off pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&gt; Inflation data also painted a somewhat reassuring picture. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings rose less than expected at 4.8% (+0.3% month over month), below consensus expectations of 5.0% and 0.4%, and not enough to keep up with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the increase in labor participation helped limit wage increases, but we have a long way to go there still. The labor market is still 3.9 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels and the labor market remains under-supplied, as noted above. In other words, further improvement in participation will still be needed to help contain inflation pressure.\n\n&gt; Some will argue that this report will make the Federal Reserve (Fed) think twice before accelerating tapering of its bond purchases, but we\u2019re not so sure.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere were a number of positives with this jobs report,\u201d explained LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. \u201cLabor force participation increased and the unemployment rate fell\u2014both of which point to a continued strong jobs market. That may give the Fed reasons to speed up its tapering plans.\u201d\n\n&gt; Overall, this report is a disappointing reminder that we\u2019re going to have to wait longer for the booming jobs numbers that we still expect to see. We continue to expect more people to get back to work in the months ahead, in an environment of strong labor demand, which can help alleviate wage pressure and firm up the economic growth outlook. Omicron is a risk but based on the information we have today, we do not expect that variant, or any others, to meaningfully slow the job market recovery in 2022.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 3rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.5.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$COUP $MDB $HQY $GTLB $SUMO $AZO $DBI $ALCO $CHPT $PLAY $SFIX $TOL $SOL $PD $S $CDMO $AVAV $LOVE $GME $RH $PATH $GEF $OXM $CHWY $LULU $COST $ORCL $AVGO $MTN $KLXE $KSPN $ASO**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/r0gUrDf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/evjwA2L.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/br3K0zL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hbGoBFe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  12.7.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tM8wghC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hhcFlGr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lPByiPr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FNjpxcY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2PUPQhA.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6kqQxly.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/OcHR8nI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.10.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.),\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",

I also think it's 50 million shares outstanding is pretty healthy but im concerned about further liquidation as it grows. Looking like it's breaking down its $15.50 level of support possible dipping further, I'd it does I have about 2k of dry powder I'm thinking about throwing into it for a long term hold as I'm in love woth the underlying assets it holds. I also think as far as ETF's go it's cheap (currently $15.19). Am I forgetting anything in my preliminary DD? Thoughts on the stock?",
