        "selftext": "Alright fellow autismos listen up. If the beer virus doesn't tank the market this is freest money you will ever see. Semiconductor stocks are way up, AMD and NVDA are printing like crazy. AAPL is still putting up impressive numbers in spite of the guidance adjustment they just gave. As some of you may know most of the big semiconductors are reliant on two companies. Here's a chart to show where the money goes:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0obj5ffxyh41.png?width=2338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb986fbced13dc0118b0af6ae24c209004810c6\n\nGlobal Foundries is a private fabricator (sorry no tendies on these guys), they focus on the older 14nm process (they tried 7nm and gave up because they found it was unaffordable to outfit a plant to fab the chips. Because of this IBM switched to Samsung for it's next-gen chips). Intel is also famously struggling to get 7nm up and running. Only two companies really have play in the 7nm space, Samsung and TSMC (traded as TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC is largest dedicated semiconductor foundry in the world. Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, and Apple all buy chips from TSMC. The more each of these companies is in demand, the more money TSMC makes. Their competition is weak right now, Samsung Semiconductor is huge, but you can't invest in them, and they only really make chips for their phones sold outside the US and for IBM (and those chips are for supercomputers, servers, and mainframes not for consumers). They mostly focus on DRAM and SSDs. TSMC is a position right now where it is indispensable to a lot of the worlds largest corporations (Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all use TSMC products). Right now all these companies are on an absolute tear. TSMC announces earning on April 16th and option prices are ripe. Go get them tendies boiz.",

Already exceeding demand, TSM increased production. Recent report from Taiwan is Coronavirus hasn't affected TSMs production line to a great extent. Still having the same guidance for the current quarter.\n\nApple is currently expecting to sell 20 million iPhone 9s to be sold in the next quarter.\n\n**TSMC locked in 5nm A14 Bionic for AAPL, 7nm Big Navi for AMD, and 7nm Ampere for NVDA. Apple is expected to sell over 100 million iPhone 12s this year and the A14 chip production starts soon, the best part is TSM recently announced bear virus won't affect their production output and it's business asusual**\n\nThey are also expanding rapidly to meet the rising global demand for chips. PS5 and Xbox Series X chips are also produced by them. They are selling chips faster than they can make them.\n\nTSM is fluctuating between 59 to 53 for a while due to bear virus news.

        "selftext": "Hi, first time posting on Reddit so if I screw this up please go easy. I made some investments yesterday in what I hope was an opportunity to get some quality stocks at a discount. I bought: UPS, MasterCard, Disney, Apple, Qualcomm and AMD. I also took a flyer on Inovio Pharmaceuticals with a small position. \n\nMy rationale is these are quality stocks (I know Inovio is speculative) with strong growth prospects, taken down in the past week by a market which I believe is overreacting to the potential economic impact of the coronavirus. \n\nMy investing horizon is the next 10 years, so if it takes time to go up I'm good. That said, I obviously don't want to lose money -- and I'm hoping to see significant appreciation over that time period. What do you think? Thanks for your input.",

        "selftext": "With Qualcomm\u2019s earnings coming tomorrow AH, I\u2019m curious what you guys think of a play.\n\nWith their 6-yr deal with Apple they have a stronger revenue projection. Although, they won\u2019t be supplying this until probably end of the year.\n\nThis quarter won\u2019t have much to tell, but analyst already know this and have adjusted earnings expectations to be relatively weak.\n\nFacebook did their earnings and showed a strong growth in their other revenue section which is mainly coming from their Oculus Quest VR sales. This is only about 330m though, but this was for Q4 2019.\n\nQualcomm supplies the Oculus Quest with their snapdragon chipset. The Quest killed sales this year for Christmas selling out everywhere and had a ship date of mid-January around the end of December. This ship date continued to grow through January and is currently now March 3rd. This isn\u2019t due to shipping delays but actual orders (I have a Quest and have just been in general watching the ship date/there\u2019s continuing to be more players online).\n\nQualcomm will focus on 5g and those potentials, but maybe this added revenue can give them a bit of a boost/talking point.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019re playin it or if you have other good info!\n\nTLDR; Calls - Qualcomm supplies Facebook chips for their Oculus Quest VR which sold hella so maybe it\u2019ll boost revenue more than expected to help in earnings",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291cHBjPndw))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291cHBjPndw))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "By Hoseex999/Achose111\n\nFirstly, why am I writing this? \n\nAfter coming to WSB my account drop a bit like 50% but now it goes 350% up due to autistic options trading that I learned here in WSB, also someone here introduced me to SPCE here on WSB and since then I follow the stock and made some good gains. So, I want to write some interesting shit in return to WSB. \n\nAlso, I think if I post this on r/stocks or r/investing I would be considered a heretic, be condemned for not following the guidance of the holy Intelligent Investor and be prema banned for not looking at fundamentals, so I choose to post here.\n\nThis thread talks about a few market bubbles, history of space industry, the potential of SPCE and the rationale behind being the grand bubble stock.\n\nIs gonna be long, jump to the the bubble part if you are bored.\n\n\\-----\n\nPreface: \n\nDuring the 1995-2000 Dot com Bubble, there are so many companies + useless startups that could cash in so much money by simply building some shit and claim is the future. \n\nFor example, Netscape without even a hint of profitability skyrocketed as high as $74.75 per share on its first day of trading before finishing the day at $58.25. The closing price valued the web browser at around $3 billion. By the end of 1995, Netscape shares traded at $174. In 1999, AOL acquired Netscape during the height of the bubble in a deal valuing the company at $10 billion. \n\nThis is just one small internet stock that successfully suck the cash out from retards in the dot com bubble. The larger internet company names such as yahoo, AOL, E\\*TRADE, eBay, Priceline.com, and Amazon.com are tracked with the by the Bloomberg US Internet Index, Before and After Dot-com Bubble, the combined market values of the 280 stocks had fallen to $1.193 trillion currently from $2.948 trillion at their peak, a loss of $1.755 trillion. See 1.\n\nFrom a source I forgot, during the bubble in the US there are around 3-5 thousand ppl quit their jobs and do day trading full time, 5 mil people also joined in and invested some of their cash into the tech market. While we could say the people are retard in the 2000s and lose trillions on the bubble, some of these stocks ultimately become part of our society and we become heavily reliant on these companies. \n\nThe point is if a person could get in into some stock bubbles and get out alive before the burst, we could get so much tendies and waste it on useless shit. (Btw, there are always a few in the market, like the small 3d printing bubble in 2013, DDD&amp; SSYS goes to 100 and goes back down, currently it still hover around 10-20)\n\nSo, now I would want to talk about SPCE, the history, the billionaire space race and the potential reason to become a grand meme stock.\n\n\\-----\n\nSpace is only for the rich:\n\nIn 2004, there is a competition called the Ansari X Prize, basically a few teams compete to become the first company to build a spaceship to space. Guess which team win? The answer is Scaled Composites, which later formed the spaceship company with VG and is also the company that build white knight two, the mothership ship VG is still using today. In fact, SpaceShipOne the spaceship built in 2004 could reach 112 km which is still higher than today\u2019s VG SpaceShipTwo 90km. see 2.\n\nI even made a comparison photo here https://imgur.com/a/JpxcdMY , what I found was that after 15 years, while the vid quality improved quite a bit, the spaceship is mostly the same as in 2004, this is due to the fact that converting from a smaller prototype to a functional tourist spaceship is way harder then everyone could though. \n\n\u201cI believe that our real significance of this program is that realization,\u201d he said then, \u201cand I believe that realization will attract investment, and that realization will attract a whole bunch of activity and very soon it will be affordable for you to fly.\u201d - Burt Rutan, Engineer of SpaceShipOne in 2004 See 3.\n\nNow is Feb,2020 and we still haven\u2019t sent ordinary people to space without paying 50 mil to board a Souyz to space.\n\nI once read that software companies are so easy to generate money because you just need to write some code, make servers, sell your services easily to audience across the globe and you could already generate income without heavy overhead costs. \n\nBut Space industry on the other hand is simply expensive, it requires loads of cash for everything from launching, R&amp;D, staff, etc. Sending a kg of stuff cost around 2700 USD, the ISS costs around 150 BN should show you how expensive space is. Most participants that are in the Ansari X Prize (some are listed below) go bust.\n\nRocketplane- Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010\n\nArmadillo Aerospace-Have around 1 mil USD of investment, but in hibernation mode since 2013\n\nXCOR Aerospace- Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2017\n\nUnlike Facebook where you could build it by a few ppl in Harvard, Space companies needs loads of initial investment, staff, expensive testing costs, years of development and high failure rate means it is simply impossible for people without at least a few millions/outside investors to start a space company let alone grow it into a successful space venture.\n\nThus, space is a billionaire race ground. Elon, Jeff and Branson is competing with each other, they are also interestingly the only 3 people that could make Reusable launch system. See 4\n\n\\-----\n\nReason that SPCE becomes a bubble meme stock: \n\nI think everyone now should get a glimpse on why there is so many successful internet companies but so few space companies. Space is like million dollars\u2019 + many years worth of hard and thus very few companies could become successful. But on the other hand, it gave the reason for SPCE to ascend into the ultimate meme stock.\n\nIn many stock market bubbles, no matter small or big like 3d printing, dot com, 2008 real estate bubble, railroad mania or the endless stock market bubbles there are always many companies that a person could invest in that sector. There are like hundreds of stocks to invest in the dot com bubble and at least dozens of 3d printing stocks to invest in the US, UK, China or in Europe \n\nBut what about space industry stocks? \n\nULA: Good luck pumping LMT and BA\n\nIridium: Starlink would likely make Iridium out of business, would not recommend.\n\nStarlink: There is likely the same or even more hype levels for Starlink then VG, but until there is an IPO, I won\u2019t count it, even then there is a IPO, there is only two stocks that everyone would mostly trade on, VG are also on different business then Starlink so zero competition between them\n\nBlue Origin: Bezos is not going to IPO it, he doesn\u2019t need to. His wealth is Blue Origin mkt cap and it currently weighs around 100+Bn\n\nSpaceX: Elon said he would not IPO SpaceX, so not an option too.\n\nChina, Russia, Japan, EU: Currently zero stocks that are passenger space/ communication related, all are either state owned or non-existence. \n\n\\-----\n\nThe Bubble: \n\nSo, here comes the point, if any fund manager unless it could buy into SpaceX via deals, normal person, boomer, millennials, people from other countries is going to buy into the space industry there is only Virgin Galactic that a person could buy (or you could buy Iridium which is gay and not recommended).\n\nWe all know space is going to be the future and yet I found it shocking that for an industry that has such huge potential, there are only 4 companies that represent the space industry and other are funded by governments, 2 are out of touch, ULA is only a small part of BA and LMT, so a person could only buy VG if it wants space to be a part of its portfolio.\n\nThis is a stark contrast to many stock bubbles where there are many choices that a person could invest on, you could buy an internet index back in the dot com boom or many real estate/bank stock choices for the 08 crisis. \n\nVG is the only one stock that 99% could invest on. I think this is the reason that would lead it to become a ultimate bubble stock, assuming even 0.1% of us stock investors which is around 100 thousand of people in the US invest 10k into the company, it would already add 1bn onto VG, 1 billion is pocket change for many large funds and if they want to be in part of the space race, most of them could only buy VG.\n\nEven a small news of relocation could jump the stock about 20% and is still up 40% since news release, imagine just releasing news such as day for launch, reopen sales, etc., when it eventually rides Branson I would not surprise it goes up 100%. After all, in the dot com bubble 500% increase from IPO is rather common, even QUALCOMM goes up around 2000% in the dot comm bubble and reach 88 in 2000, it only goes back to 88 recently and is now only 2 dollars up @ 90.56 in feb,2020. \n\nI think most people don\u2019t realize how this stock could be a stock in the history books, if according to history of how bubble stock forms, the bubble would grow for a while until it reaches hype point when the US goes back to the moon in 2024 and may burst or run for 1-2 more years. \n\nWhile it may be a large company in the 2030-2040 like how amazon is in the 2000 and it become today, we are talking about getting in, trade in a bubble and GTFO before things goes to shit. \n\n\\-----\n\nConclusion: \n\nVG is still the only stock that represent the hype and for anyone to invest into space industry. Even if you think my analysis is retard just please don\u2019t short the stock, you could not predict the only space stock that the public is allowed to put their money in would behave.\n\n1. https://money.cnn.com/2000/11/09/technology/overview/\n\n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne\\_flight\\_17P\n\n3. https://spacenews.com/what-the-hell-happened-the-rise-and-fall-of-suborbital-space-tourism-companies/\n\n4.

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.
