        "selftext": "Time for an update to my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ixtmfu/the_orcl_and_not_the_one_from_omaha/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Byte Dance wants to kowtow before its buyers and the state powers who hold the proverbial knife. A lot of negative news has been building up over the weeks, until today, when [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-02/bytedance-works-to-resolve-tiktok-concerns-as-process-drags-on), released a new article suggesting Byte Dance is doing everything to address the security concerns of this deal. Possibly dragging the outcome past the **November 12th** deadline, when a ban of the app by the Dept of Commerce would be enforced.\n\nSo, I think several questions must be asked about this deal.\n\n1.  How does Byte Dance  assuage China, to approve the deal, if it requires the export of the \"AI algorithm source code?\"\n2. How  will the US react to a deal that does not contain this \"source code?\"\n3. If Byte Dance moves it HQ to [London](https://nypost.com/2020/08/03/tiktok-owners-will-relocate-to-london-from-beijing/#:~:text=LONDON%20%E2%80%94%20TikTok%20owner%20ByteDance%20will,officials%2C%20The%20Sun%20newspaper%20reported), could this reshape take the deal?\n\nIf Byte Dance cannot  reach an agreement to kept their source code a secret, China will most likely kill this deal. Likewise if the US does not get the source code , as part of the agreement, the deal is dead.  \nBut, something of interest to note: when Byte Dance applied for their export license, an announcement  was made to move their HQ out of China.  If this move is approved by China, the whole deal dynamic could be reshaped. \n\nSo,  watching the news over Byte Dance's recent court cases to delay the ban, and seeing its success. I think Byte Dance could be maneuvering themselves to maintain control in the event of the sale of TikTok. However, Donnie expressly said he would deny the deal should Byte Dance retain any ownership and not divest it interest in TikTok. \n\nWhere does that leave us? Well it seems to move the timeline for the Oracle-Walmart deal into mid November. China could still deny the deal earlier, but recent news would suggest a longer play at this time. \n\nic $ORCL 56, qty 20 expires OCT2nd, rolled to ic $ORCL 55, qty 20 OCT9th\n\nLook to take some profit early due to Donnie's COVID contraction.",
