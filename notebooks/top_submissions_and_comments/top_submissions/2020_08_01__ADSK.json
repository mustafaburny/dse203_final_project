In some ways I was privileged because I got to work with my dad in factories during an era where manufacturing technology started to change in drastic ways. It inspired me as a young pup which eventually lead me down the road of online mathematics-related education. Lucky for you, this includes game theory and finances.\n\nI write these DD's because I believe I have an enormous advantage in the current climate. I love to distribute knowledge, love the process of learning and I consider it one of my hobbies.\n\nI self-taught myself serverless and cloud computing technologies while I was in school and moved to California to pursue building my dream company in education technology. It also appears that the US is shifting toward increased Mexican trade, which I understand quite closely and have written about before.\n\nI love education and I love teaching - it is my passion. The intent here is to spur imagination and debate on the subject. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as an Education Company\n\n[Compliance is king](https://preview.redd.it/mil0bshb4qe51.png?width=2782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b42c5173e74ab83bd9cc38b115796a772c6d5b43)\n\nDropbox has a wonderful history introducing the masses to cloud computing applications. It solved a real file problem at the time - Apple and Microsoft files were not intuitive and there was a split in adoption. Academics of various ages needed an elegant solution and that was Dropbox. Think about that; users looked to solve a File Operating System problem using cloud computing in 2007. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDropbox is an education company. The best education technology companies are those that support the flow of education with high quality tooling rather than trying to replace it. Under this framework, I regularly invest in things like Autodesk, Adobe, and Dropbox as the companies have created an environment where IT school administrators will offer Creative Cloud, Autodesk, and Dropbox services under their student email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are familiar with the American education system, you know that this is an absurdly slow dinosaur when it comes to getting changes in motion. Technology, as a result, has to execute in rather phenomenal way to even have a chance in the education space. This is why you'll see awfully accessible and robust technology exist in the space - Windows, Macs, Chromebooks, Khan Academy, Symbolab, Dropbox, Adobe, Autodesk, Oracle, Blackboard, Canvas, etc. They are convenient tools that pay a lot of attention to things like ADA (disabilities) compliance and the like.\n\nThere is a revolution occurring in education in the form of disabilities pedagogy (the study of how to teach). Unlocking a lot of understanding in children with non-verbal autism, PTSD, and other serious learning challenges is an enormous frontier in teaching, learning, and understanding human development. \\*\\*These technologies do not get in the way and exist to assist.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as a Technical Product\n\nThe File &amp; Storage system in any given operating system will always be critically important to a user and the need will always be larger than you can anticipate. It extends from IT safety, banking, education, supercomputing, and so on. Can you evaluate the amount of storage and data needed after Machine Learning tools have grown for 10 years? It can not be determined, but it can be anticipated. Organizations that have built their own distributed infrastructure are advantaged. One can reasonably assume that these companies will distribute the building blocks to their products. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu67kf179qe51.png?width=2953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16a1ce179420a08750c5df246064f6eebdad30cc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: the CEO is currently in the Board of Directors of Facebook - who is also looking into workspace applications \\*\\*SPECIFICALLY TO SOLVE LONG TERM WORK-FROM-HOME COMMUNICATIONS\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workplace @ Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/vpcnvvru4qe51.png?width=3382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b3f6da6502c53102a73047c4b13977f3d498b1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workspace @ Dropbox](https://preview.redd.it/rr462ns25qe51.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb2ba0e8e4fcc2bc24e82129bd0e209bee2d55d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is an enormous list of high-quality features that Dropbox offer due to its integration and infrastructure approach across multiple platforms:\n\n* \\- File security\n\n[banned by xi](https://preview.redd.it/mtg94ntd8qe51.png?width=1411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e62965952b2e9b876860beede13c106b59115f6)\n\n* \\- Signatures\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewaxdbdl8qe51.png?width=2791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce09ff54bad22b1920a33326478f69e11171a81d\n\n* \\- Computer vision document scanning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OCR](https://preview.redd.it/0551mtwz8qe51.png?width=2413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22ec6a63fe1fe5935dea0d7c743ea4a202f7a393)\n\n* \\- Workspace expectations (file syncing, large file transfers, organization,IT controls)\n* \\- Link generators to leak those sweet unreleased albums through zoom [https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0)\n* \\- File embedding \n* \\- Self-built storage infrastructure\n* \\- Deep industry wide integrations ranging from Zoom to Adobe\n* \\- Deep relationships in the education sector\n* \\- An unholy amount of other file solutions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hicx44ptdqe51.png?width=2547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc087db00260d31a49e3c33a32020848f9d91e05\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Compliance Advantage\n\nCloud computing is no longer a mystery, nor is it an open secret. It's a necessary supply chain tool, demanded, and growing faster than imaginations can keep up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work in the fintech industry. Let me tell you, compliance is everything. There is no Square, Paypal, Dropbox, Cloudflare, or any of your favorite important apps without various degrees of compliance. It would be much more helpful to view Square as an organization that distributes compliance to it's small businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \\- For Banking it's the Bank Secrecy Act and PATRIOT Act\n* \\- For Education it's FERPA\n* \\- For Healthcare it's HIPAA\n* \\- The list goes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean? It's means that mature cloud companies like Cloudflare, Dropbox, and the like are in an excellent positions to \\*\\*satisfy the legal means to continue to grow at scale\\*\\*. This is an extremely important factor to consider in the next 5 years. **Dropbox is not something people \"get\" -  it's something that they're \"given\".** For example, when I signed my name to accept my first career job - I was given Dropbox's HelloSign to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cloud Computing Hierarchy of needs](https://preview.redd.it/s3hfokxg5qe51.png?width=2981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ff1c87c8db5802df55d7f4156ee9b9f2e4f23c4)\n\n[Compliance advantage in education](https://preview.redd.it/s1qhcdxj5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34678980f20b163d47ec041add6defae67720038)\n\n[Another example of compliance-focused approaches](https://preview.redd.it/6nhym58n5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bc8101854eaa2a29f643f630024be629b23b9de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Monopoly Problem &amp; Integrations Competitors\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d1vs3oy5qe51.png?width=1835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81db898c8bd65364d7b2162ede4daecd5455547e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverybody knows it. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple is a monopoly cluster on data. Breaking them up is not a complex equation. Much like the death of a drug or religious cartel; there are many other viable candidates eager to steer the wheel in another direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is possible to compete against them, as evidence by organizations like Dropbox, Cloudflare, TikTok, Zoom, and the like. These smaller companies combining is what I consider the Unicorn Operating System. There opportunity is by distributing infrastructure to overwhelm larger companies that depend on acquisitions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is already happening. Zoom &amp; Dropbox distribute infrastructure.\n\n[Cloud Infrastructure is critical.](https://preview.redd.it/2entdn446qe51.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f486402438fd28382c109b7e3cc6c62483f99a1a)\n\n[Dropbox executing like a pioneer, similar to Paypal](https://preview.redd.it/wfli2evh6qe51.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7e0ac53777e81ff94736208493a873475eed8ef)\n\n# # Dropbox Financially\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7s08qzcdqe51.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9ad76618cd785e924f3e2203480903a9e681e0d\n\nThis part easy.

        "selftext": "Listen up fellow autists, during my education I have spend a lot of time using the 3D printers and generative design software. And the software of the very company now going public beat every tested competitor in usability, design iteration time and design validation time. Their software (live parts) had the most intuitive to use visual feedback and the shortest time for iterations and design changes. With a few tweaks to their software they could become the market leader.\n\nWhat their software allows is to export the result of your design simulation directly as a usable 3D file. Using other software, you had to use the simulation result to construct such a file yourself, taking at least 30 minutes \u2013 2 hours based on complexity. The few tweaks I\u2019m talking about are adding the possibility to design products based on multiple different loads in different directions. Think of the loads normally seen on the wheel of a car, there is the normal force, the corner force and the acceleration / braking force. The design needs to withstand all three of these. In addition, they only supported full fixtures in their simulations, giving parts to much stiffness. Accounting for these two is made easy since you can export their 3D design very quickly and validate using other simulation software. Other software has these problems as well but with them the time to validate using other simulation software is longer since you need to design the parts yourself instead of pressing export.\n\nNow you might be wondering why is this important? Fuck do I care about some bitch ass design software? Well this is not just any design software, this is a peek into the future of mechanical engineering. This shit will change how every fucking product that is in your house is produced or is transported there. Buying a new car? In 20 years every part will designed using generative design.  Were talking about a company here that has managed to merge ai with design and in a time efficient way. Other software such as SOLIDWORKS gives crap results, AUTODESK dreamcatcher might be up for the task. But all others are fucked. And this software package is only a side project of their company.\n\nTheir main products are metal 3D printers and machines aiding that process. These products can be mass produced and once it catches on big time in the manufacturing industry this shit will print tendies.\n\nThis is the near future, 5 years from now. In 10-15 years our products will asses themselves using inbuilt sensors and convey this information to the AI designing the newest iteration of the product. No longer will excess material be a thing, imagine how much money you could save by making every car lighter by 2%. How much material that would save. There is a big market for this type of engineering and it will only grow in the next decades.\n\nPositions: Desktop metal (DM) call 2021\n\nIpo is expected to be fourth quarter this year.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed\u2019s anticipated policy framework review.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we know the Fed\u2019s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You\u2019re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed\u2019s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed\u2019s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.\n*****\n&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let\u2019s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they\u2019re not going to stop it,\u201d said Caron. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay there for awhile. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Where\u2019s the stimulus?\n&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the thing I\u2019m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the politics are shifting beneath that.\u201d He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.\n*****\n&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.\n*****\n&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,\u201d said Keon. \u201cAs the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don\u2019t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It\u2019s not panicking about it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. \u201cAs the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. \u201cDemocrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,\u201d said Mills.\n*****\n&gt; # It\u2019s the economy\n&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.\n*****\n&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.\n*****\n&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0FgKliy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yHvkn2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L2S9kUV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kgk42Nv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMOmbjC.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kCvYfYX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jwR8nq6.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nSC6K2N.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/bwcCQMYv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/yxfJ72fy/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nr453Zw/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs\n\n&gt; \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d\n\n&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThis will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn\u2019t a shock to see new highs this quickly.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there\u2019s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early \u201880s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early \u201890s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February \u201961, July \u201980, November \u201982, and March \u201991. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)\n\n&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.\n\n&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.\n\n&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion.

Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays\n\n&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.\n\n&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.\n\n&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**\n\n&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven\u2019t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they\u2019ve actually given us credit for coining the \u201ctriple play\u201d term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.\n\n&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGhxT3rxKxc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCwfvNh2iXU))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$BIG** \n&gt; * **$COTY** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$SPLK**\n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$TOL** \n&gt; * **$VMW** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$FLWS** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FKXPQh9j/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST INCREASE IN EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/G3q2ZwT4/erincrease1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RwgQ9SD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mvBOGth.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY6k2e0.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rx2gJbQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zKSTcN5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/B3hFxJN.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wqQ6cS6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tln4z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7xetbo6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Buy Co., Inc. $114.00\n&gt; **Best Buy Co., Inc.

        "selftext": "Listen up fellas. \n\nTelehealth has tremendous potential moving forwards, we all know that. Additionally, the world is becoming increasingly cognizant of mental health and the importance of maintaining it. \n\nOTRK combines telehealth with mental health. I would describe what they do but the Motley Fool probably does it better than me:\n\n \"The artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform targets and engages with those coping with chronic conditions whose lives can improve with behavioral change. The company then delivers its insights to patients either in-person or via telehealth connection with a healthcare professional.\n\nLike Livongo, Ontrak partners with employers and healthcare plans to find, treat, and support those with behavioral health conditions, eventually delivering medical expense savings upwards of 50%.\"\n\nA lot of people have been comparing OTRK to LVGO over the last few weeks. For those who don't know, LVGO is a &gt;12B market cap stock who deals with telehealth for diabetes. They grew heavily in 2019 and 2020, with revenue going from $40M to $91 M in Q2 2020. They are now positive cash flow, whereas they were bigly in the red a year ago. From this growth their stock has seen over a 400% increase in value.  \n\nGuess which company has similar financial to the old LVGO. OTRK made 17 M in revenue (+124% YoY) in Q2 2020, but is debt ridden and has negative cash flow. They shot up almost 100% on the earnings beat to $60 and now have a market cap of $1B. This seems like a fair valuation, as they're following the footsteps of LVGO but still need a few more years to get there, right? WRONG\n\nIn the OTRK earnings call, their CEO Terren Peizer gave guidance for 90 MILLION total revenue in 2020. They're at less 30 Million after two quarters. That's some rapid fucking growth. The CEO seems a little sketchy. He did some work in 1983 as a highly yield bond salesman and he ratted on one of his buddies to the SEC in exchange for immunity. I don't trust the guy and you shouldn't either. \n\nBut, their CEO is pumping the shit out of this company, and who the hell is going to tell him he's wrong until their next earnings report when we actually get to see what they've been up to. Their $1B market cap should probably be $3B by the next earnings call if people buy into his projections. That's a stock price of $60-$180.\n\nThis company is possibly a scam, so be wary, but this shit could pump to the moon. \n\nDISCLAIMER: These options have relatively low volume and large bid/asks. Don't try and make hella trades with this shit. Get into a position you like and hold it for a few weeks. \n\nTLDR: Buy OTM options on OTRK dated no later than November.",

        "selftext": "**Overview**\n\nIn order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, governments in [188 different countries](https://www.brookings.edu/research/school-closures-government-responses-and-learning-inequality-around-the-world-during-covid-19/) have implemented school closures. For the United States specifically, every state and territory ordered or recommended school closures\u2014affecting upwards of 55 million students across the country. Wary of the achievement gap that could spur from prolonged closures, the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) has recently released [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools-faq.html) for reopening schools. Moreover, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York [recently announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/nyregion/cuomo-schools-reopening.html) that schools can decide to open so long as they are in a region where the average rate of positive coronavirus tests is below 5 percent over a two-week period.\u00a0\n\n**Efficacy of School Reopening: Lessons from Other Nations**\n\nExtended school closures impact students in a variety of ways: it fosters learning loss, weakens social and emotional skills, entrenches abuse in unstable homes, and can lead to a decline in nutritional health. Cognizant of the importance of in-person instruction, multiple countries have already set guidelines to reopen their schools:\n\n*Denmark*\n\n* In Denmark, students were to stay 2 meters apart wherever possible, were grouped into \u201cbubbles\u201d of 12, and were required to wash their hands every two hours but not to wear masks.\u00a0\n\n*Germany*\n\n* In Germany, their government cut class sizes in half, had one-way hallways, staggered breaks, masks for teachers and free twice-weekly Covid-19 tests for students and teachers.\n\n*Taiwan*\n\n* In Taiwan, students returned to school and were required to go through temperature checks at school entries and to wear face masks. Additionally, Taiwan left school reopening to a more localized decision to account for differing infection rates in the country.\n\nIn each of these nations, case and mortality counts continued to decline after reopening schools\u2014a positive indication that school reopenings have been effectively implemented with a variety of guidelines.\n\n**Concerns With School Reopening**\n\nAlthough some governments were able to successfully reopen schools, other governments were not as successful. In Jerusalem, over 100 students and 15 staff members were infected after an outbreak occurred at a high school. To alleviate the spread of COVID-19 in schools, the CDC recommends more research on mitigation strategies (i.e. face masks, the use of cohorting, social distancing).\n\nThe Council of Chief State School Officers estimated that schools would need between $158.1 billion and $244.6 billion in additional funding to open safely.\u00a0\n\nOn top of the estimated [158.1 billion to 244.6 billion dollars](https://ccsso.org/blog/ccsso-submits-cost-estimate-safely-reopening-public-schools-after-covid) school are estimated to need to open safely, considering that the United States has recently surpassed five million virus cases, school reopenings could pose a harm to children\u2014especially considering that the response to COVID-19 has not been as effective as other nations that have reopened schools.\n\n**Financial Impacts**\n\n*Stocks*\n\nOnline educational institutions and virtual schools have seen increases in enrollment as a result of extended school closures. Publicly traded company K12\u2014which currently owns 40% of the market\u2014saw [stocks rise 21%.](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-03-05-public-markets-watch-for-coronavirus-impact-on-edtech-stocks) Chegg, a popular service for study materials and tutors, has seen stocks rise [87% in the last year.](https://investorplace.com/2020/07/5-online-education-stocks-that-can-expand-your-horizons/)\n\n*Costs to School Districts*\n\nThe pandemic will cost states [$555 billion over fiscal years 2020 to 2022.](https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/states-continue-to-face-large-shortfalls-due-to-covid-19-effects) Seeing as school districts rely on state funding and local tax revenue that is likely to be cut because of rampant unemployment, it is likely that districts will have to resort to laying off employees or lessening the quality of education. This occurred during the Great Recession when the Clark County School District in Nevada [laid off upwards of 500 employees in a single year.](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2011/01/13/16landscape.h30.html)\n\nLet us know what you think!",

        "selftext": " \n\n **Tinley Beverage Company ($TNYBF $TNY)** makes award winning cannabis beverages in California. The flavors are designed to replicate alcoholic drinks like Fireball, Margarita, Moscow Mule, Malibu Coconut Rum, Amaretto, Kahlua. They also offer non-alcoholic ready to drink cocktails under the Beckett's brand names, available at Bevmo, and soon to begin trials at warehouse stores like Sam's or Costco.\n\nThey built a new plant with a high-tech bottling line, which recently received its license, and will soon be commissioned into use. In addition to making their own drinks, they are expected to announce copacking deals to make cannabis drinks for their clients. Former NBA player Baron Davis is on board as an advisor, he helped grow and sell Vitaminwater. Here are some of their key upcoming events anticipated by long-term shareholders. Particularly of interest are the copacking deals to manufacture beverages for other cannabis companies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q2 Financials (Ending June 30th) will be out in just a few short weeks.** To give you an idea what this might look like: As of June 24th, \"the Company has fully exhausted its inventory of Tinley\u2122 \u201927 multi-serve products, which were produced at the Company\u2019s recently-decommissioned Phase 2 facility. The Company\u2019s inventory of carbonated, ready-to-drink products is nearly depleted\". \"The Company expects to generate initial co-packing revenue in Q2 from pre-production packaging services\". These numbers will be interesting nonetheless. As a comparison, at March 31st, the Company had $174,000 in revenues for the first 3 months of the year, and $277,807 in finished goods. The releases subsequent have laid it out black and white, this product has been SOLD. When it hits the financials is another question, but it is coming. There will obviously be a period of time throughout Q3 that some product would not be widely available until the most recent production at Long Beach.\n\n**The Company's Long Beach Facility is fully licensed (and producing)!** As of July 2, \"the initial run of Tinley\u2019s\u2122 \u201927 products will include the Company\u2019s new Tinley\u2019s\u2122 \u201927 Arabica Cask.\" There had been some speculation as to whether this would happen \"mid-July\". As stated, \"the Company expects the first bottling run to take place in the facility by mid-July.\" Since this time, pictures with multi-serve beverages, mainly the Cinnamon Cask, have come to light. Remember that the Coconut Cask is the Company's number 1 seller. Reading between the lines, one can infer that even though the Cinnamon pictures came out a few days ago, the Coconut Cask was most surely produced before then. Production would have been occurring over the past few weeks as a result. As of July 29 interview with Jeff Maser and Money Works Magazine, production was in the works at that very moment in time, and had been for some time already.  Single serves will be completed after the multi. The team is working to get California stocked.\n\n**A massive consumer trend in non-alcoholic beverages has emerged while many of us have been shareholders, right under our noses.** Further to the Money Works Magazine interview, one development that has taken hold over the last year or two is that a massive, massive, consumer trend has emerged in non-alcoholic beverages. This has occurred during the time many of you have been shareholders. The massive demand for this emerging trend is prudent to capture; it had an estimated market share of $18 Billion last year alone, growing in the triple digits in certain markets around the world. The company has diversified its risk by focusing attention to it, and used their know-how and resources to capitalize on this astronomical growth. Remember, the Company's principals are the best of the best in the beverage space (their bio's are at the bottom of this post). They're making strategic decisions on behalf of shareholders, allocating time and efforts where money is to be made. Bear in mind that although infused beverages are the Company's bread and butter (Tinley's), regulations have made its rollout much slower than that of Beckett's (non-infused line). Beckett's can be rolled out very easily (using the same great taste and formulations already developed), while regulators take their time to make many facets of the business easier (or more difficult?). Revenue recognition is also much, much faster with Beckett's. Banking regulations unfortunately make revenue recognition much slower with Tinley's. Some have pointed out that Jeff has only mentioned Beckett's lately. In Canada, there is an extremely fine line when talking about the two business lines. The regulations do not allow for a cross marketing of the two. You either talk about Tinley's, or you talk about Beckett's, not both. Be cognizant of this.\n\n**The Company has at least 4 commitments from supermarkets/chains for Beckett's.** The June monthly CSE report (form 7) stated, the company is \"working to obtain additional grocery, liquor store and other retail placements for its beverages\". The July report had a slight change of wording: the Company is \"working to begin trials at the previously-disclosed grocery and warehouse chains, as well as obtain additional grocery, liquor store ecommerce and other retail placements for its non-infused beverages\". This indicates they are one step closer to a rollout. Jeff indicated in the most recent interview with Money Works Magazine that they \"ramped up production;\" producing more Beckett's last week for these demos.\n\n**Closing of the current Private Placement will happen today.** Since its announcement several weeks ago, the share price has held steady, but the most important development here - nearly 5 million shares have been purchased, in the open market, over this time. (Most likely bought off of those selling to buy in on the private placement). That is one incredibly large position that was taken over the past month. The placement took a bit of time due to some last minute due diligence by one of the houses taking interest, which is not unusual in the industry.\n\n**Celebrity endorsements are coming.** There have been some questions coming up as to why this has not happened yet. It has always been important to ensure the Company had ample inventory, and distribution in place prior to announcing these. It is **absolutely imperative** to have this in place before letting celebrities endorse and tell their followers. There have been many examples of celebrities doing such with other products, only to have inventory and website issues unable to handle the newfound demand. With beverages, you only get 1 shot to win over the consumer. Get it right, the first time. With Long Beach up and running, it is safe to say the Company is one step closer to releasing this news. The Company is \"working to finalize initiatives with prominent figures **(with an S)** in sports and entertainment for marketing of Tinley products and co-packing clients\u2019 products.\"\n\n**Copacking. There has been \"a ton of interest\".** The May 27th release is most important here: Mr. \\[Baron\\] Davis is currently working on marketing initiatives and development of new products for the Company\u2019s own products and its expected co-packing clients\u2019 products. We also know that the copackers are \"well known\". There is some major money to be had here...\"Well Known\" being the key words \ud83d\udcf7;) With the July 2nd licensing news, \"the Company is now in a position to consummate agreements in its pipeline of prospective co-packing clients, and it will update the market as such agreements come to fruition.\"\n\n**Canada will be announced \"shortly\"** regarding Beckett's, and Tinley's. When this happens, remember that Canada is a very, very large piece of real estate. The product will hit, but it's rollout and availability won't happen in a single day. It will take some time. You may see it in Toronto right away for example, but may take some time to reach its way to Vancouver.

        "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been riding AMD\u2019s cock since late June and have made some great returns, especially in the past two weeks. That being said, today I sold my remaining call contracts on the stock. No, not because I think AMD is going to drop (although it will have price pullback all the way down to $77)- but because I think there\u2019s an opportunity that many investors (including you autists and bag holders) are overlooking.\n\nINTC took a massive hit the last two weeks (-$13.42 between 07/20-07/31) , following a pump on AMD after their Q2 earnings beat, with the additional help of many news outlets covering the AMD versus INTC battle. In the midst of all of this, INTC decides to let everyone know that they will not be manufacturing chips anymore- which sealed the deal on AMD being a dominant force in the chip manufacturing industry. \n\nI see a lot of people, especially on this retarded reddit page full of blind option traders (with the exception of the 10% who know what they are doing) talk about how \u201cINTC is going to drop all the way down to $32\u201d... \n\n\n\n- Here is what you need to understand about Intel -\n\nSince 2014, Intel\u2019s revenue in the Client Computing Group (chip manufacturing) has dropped almost 7% in 6 years. You cannot let this news regarding Intel\u2019s switch in corporate direction give jurisdiction on whether you think the corporation will be of any value a year from now. It is obvious that Intel has been slowing the production of their chips for atleast two years now, and they have slowly been shifting in a different direction because of an increase in revenue provided from the data sector.\n\n\n\nSo what does this all mean?\n\nThe fact that Intel has cut the manufacturing of chips is actually a good thing for the corporation, whether you think so or not. It has been a slowly-decaying revenue stream for years, and the money can be implemented in other sectors in which Intel has seen yearly-growth in revenue.\n\nI know, it\u2019s hard. Intel isn\u2019t making chips, doesn\u2019t make sense right? Yea it kind of doesn\u2019t make sense. BUT, in a broader scheme of things, it does. They have been getting killed by their competitors for years, so the move seems appropriate.\n\n\n\nINTC STOCK\n\nThe only times INTC stock has dropped below $50, in the past 3 years, were for the following reasons:\n\nAugust to February 2018- Intel suffers scrutiny for announcing that they are shifting their focus away from chip making and towards A.I., memory solutions, cloud computing, and IoT.\n\nJuly to August 2019- News articles released regarding AMD\u2019s new Ryzen chips and their comparison to Intel.\n\nMarch 2020- Do i really need to explain this drop\n\n\n\nConsensus\n\nINTC has been hinting for YEARS that they are leaving the chip manufacturing sector and turning towards other profitable ones. Their latests announcement shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but if you are someone who hasn\u2019t followed them for years- then it may seem like one.\n\n\n\nThe reason you are reading this\n\nINTC 60C - exp 01/15/21 \nThese \u201crelatively small\u201d leap contracts are sold for pennies on the fucking dollar right now. If you read what I just wrote, which I\u2019m sure most of you won\u2019t- then you would understand that this move has a lot potential. Right now, INTC isn\u2019t gonna drop any more. If it goes below $40, then maybe I\u2019m wrong.\n\nBut I\u2019m never wrong.\n\n\n\nAmd to the moon, but lets not be retarded on how we value a major corporation like this. I mean cmon. LOL",

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

        "selftext": "Listen up fuckers.\n\n\nI\u2019m not ludicrously experienced with options, but I can recognize some bullshit when I see it. This arcticle [(Intel \u2018Stunning Failure\u2019 Heralds End of an Era for U.S. Chip Sector)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html) and a bunch of other \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b news caused $INTC to drop off the face of the earth last week. \n\n\nI kinda fail to see the drama. Intel has always outsourced it's chips. Maybe it's doing it more now, but even 8 years ago when my brother and I built our first PC's. His chip was from Mexico, mine was from Taiwan. \n\n\nFurthermore, TSMC, the company this article says Intel should sell factories to, has been the heavyweight chip maker for a decade or more.\n\n\nNvidia and AMD for example, they are the two graphics card manufacturers. BOTH of them have their chips made by TSMC. These companies do all their designing, but in the end everything is made by TSMC anyway. At least, a lions share of it.\n\n\nNow, Intel definitely has struggled in the recent market, but that's because they've demolished AMD in the performance chip market for nearly two decades. There was no reason to keep pushing their envelope, spending billions on R&amp;D for a better product. All they had to do was refine their Lake series processors and they'd continue to rake in a ton of profit. This profit was used to expand their market to the mobile industry. Particularly laptops. For a long time it was hard to get an apple product with any kind of processor that wasn't Intel.\n\n\nThey're not going away. They're not crashing.\n\n\nThey're just finally seeing AMD pass them in one market. This has caused other markets to start to shift due to uncertainty about who the \"best\" chip manufacturer is, but trust me - we will see Intel back with a fiery vengeance.\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Intel pops out some high core count chips that are pushing 5.0-5.5 all core clock count speeds. Once they scale down their transistor size... Oof. It's going to be a Rottweiler back in the pit. \n\n\n\nTL;DR INTC $55c 09/18, but load up on whatever the hell you want, these contracts are CHEAP",

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

Or GOOG invents an improvement to instant results, ie Mind Results, results pop up on your android even before you type anything, and it works on 50 different languages.

Intel is still insanely profitable with lots of collaborations and products lined up. Also safe from any COVID-19 related shutdowns.\n2. Consistent Grind Up history after beatdowns. Tends to slowly increase, but expecting a Pop tomorrow or Wednesday due to some factors listed below.\n3. Ex-dividend date this Thursday. Dividends are only distributed if bought before the date so run ups are higher likely tomorrow and Wednesday. Dividend also demonstrates the fundamental strength of the company.\n4. Alot of Insider buying recently with leaked Institutional buying this week(sorry can\u2019t say who but yeah going to get called out but it is what it isss).\n5. Stimulus package confirmation this week may cause excessive euphoria in market-leading to even more buying.\n\nSafe price target would be \\~50.4 and could easily run past 52+. Hope this helps!",

Really interesting business model for Semis AMD has.\n\nIn 2019, you couldn't get away from heating up of the trade war. Congress began debating SAR for HK around the end of  Hong Kong's \"2019 Summer of Love\" and rumors of what happens in the \"re-education\" camps / \"Where did the Falun Gong practitioners go?\" This is important because of the SWIFT system of world banking. HK is how they get dollars.\n\nThen in November of 2019, this happened..\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Human_Rights_and_Democracy_Act#Related_bill\n\nArizona plant news is where the tin foil ends and the conviction began for me. The Foundry is basically THE corporation of Taiwan. The Great Cheetoh has been making deals around the world, and technically Taiwan isn't China. We have recent armament deals with Taiwan and Japan to prove it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TLKt9yPb-f0\n\nWhy not?? Seemed like the American thing to do and there is a republican in office hell-bent on decoupling US communications tech from the CCP aka ROC.\n\nIn Feb / March... Rona. April the economic fallout, news about bad PPE and tests from China being sold to Italy. In May all the US boats in Taiwanese waters and the rhetoric worldwide basically reflecting that the world isn't happy with the CCP.\n\nI had the balance for a RH call and it made more sense than an airline play at the time, so i got in.\n\nAnti CCP rhetoric started heating up and bi-partisan on the YouTube's, by the way, it seems 2020 is the year NBC (Comcast) discovered ad-revenue. Thank you Lester.\n\nAt this point morning wood for TSM was a regular thing, so i set my limits on call options for both accounts, and incorporated into the LT DRIP. Thank you Papa Powell. I'm still poor, couldn't have done it without you...\n\nThen it seemed to be heating up at the end of May. Everyone is like WTF 'mate on the \"One Belt. One Road.\" Initiative, both the geographical and digital. People are really starting to report on not-so-great stories out of China, and not just tinfoil or Epoch Times channels.\n\nLot of shade being thrown on China tech, and things are heating up in S China Sea.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6KiLhxgIBys\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BTgDYhtr-LU\n\n...looks like Chy-na is on everyone's shit list, including Australia. Forex folks know how dope-tied the Aussie's and Kiwis are to CCP trade relations.\n\n The rumor was potential decouple from China. I mean the world is kinda dope-tied to Santa's little elves. I just realized how weird Christmas will be...\n\nI bought my shares for both accounts as per the voodoo ritual of purchasing at least 1 stock of a long term call strategy.

A little over 3,000% between 2 contracts that cost $75 total.\n\nAlong the way, i picked up RH tendies and rebalanced the cash / bought more contracts and shares. They're officially part of the DRIP.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/UFKPnOz\n\n\nRelated post I made last week regarding TSM and INTC. Any thoughts on how US semi production will play out for them?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0jqtu/opinions_on_taiwan_semiconductor/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nLast week, The Fool confirmed many of the LT bias I had been building up on a win for The Foundry since November. All hype, or real talk?\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/31/3-tailwinds-are-lifting-tsmcs-stock-to-new-all-tim.aspx\n\nFinancial analysis-\nThis guy is boring af, but he goes through the numbers that no one likes to read, records in mobile, and is cool enough to zoom in on what he is talking about.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wVxF7wwuogo\n\nCan anyone see a downside other than \"COVID CLAP Trumps all\"? Maybe I've been chewing too much YouTube tinfoil on lunch, but the limit orders that are closing 930-4pm are making me think I've hit the Autistic Lottery. Wish I had bought more.\n\nFriday, all I could see was a bull flag on the 4hr and 30min charts. Monday 8/03 it hasn't shit the bed at 11am EST. Maybe thats just the tin foil talking again and this is the ceiling.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/nRYKBB5",

The AOA sensor is manufactured by a private company called Rosemount Aerospace.\n\nAnother issue was with the \"maneuvering characteristics augmentation system\" (MCAS) which is the flight control system that is heavily impacted by all the sensors on the plane (especially the AOA).\n\nLooking forward, the FAA has clearly stated requirements that will allow the 737 MAX to return to flight around the world. they are:\n\n*  Completion of all TAB return to service (RTS) recommendations and acceptance by the TAB of those completed actions. (these are the 7 things about AOA and MCAS)\n* Completion by BA and Acceptance by FAA the new regulatory requirements\n* Official revisions to documentation/training for the 737 MAX\n\nAdditionally, there are specific requirements before it can fly in the US:\n\n* For delivered/yet to be delivered 737s, all FAA changes must be incorporated and updated based on the above changes\n* All Pilots must be trained and certified on the new changes BA will be making to aircraft operation.\n\nAfter this is compelte, FAA will issue a  Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC) (example [here](https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/media/CAN-2019-05.pdf)). this basically tells the international 737 MAX owners to:\n\n*  strongly encouraged to mandate the pilot training identified in the 737 MAX FSB report as a minimum starting point\n* be responsible for the continued airworthiness and continued operational safety (COS) of aircraft on its registry \n\nThe rest of the report breaks down in engineering terms what is wrong and how it is going to be fixed.\n\n**TL;DR: FAA is making BA rework all of its 737 MAXs. BA will likely be taking those cost directly out of its own profit margins. Buy calls / stock on their top suppliers, who BA will have to pay for all the new equipment\\***\n\n[**BA TOP SUPPLIERS**](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionNO4.php?supply&amp;code=BA)\n\n* TAITRON COMPONENTS - TAIT (no options)\n* MSFT - whatever you retards are buying for Tik Tok is fine. Leaps will be good here as well\n* TSM - Jan21 80c should work. if you are cheap do 90\n* Intel - more importantly AMD is a supplier and they will eat intel's lunch. Dell and IBM also provide them chips.\n* other big defense companies that subcontract, LMT, NOC, RTX etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*DISCLAIMER**: I am not an engineer, I am a retarded PFA for a DFEN company. I do not have any active positions from above. I will be waiting for a red day to get in.",

I'm not predicting a second crash, just looking for companies that are likely to decline no matter what. In a crash, they'll just decline more steeply, offsetting losses to long positions... in theory.\n\nFor example, I was thinking of buying puts in MAC ($7-ish)  back when it was around $35. They had been in decline for a long time while their competitors were doing fine.\n\nMaybe INTC? I don't think their troubles will be over soon. If Apple shows that custom ARM chips are superior, others will jump ship. ARM is making inroads even in the enterprise market.  (If NVDA does buy ARM, that would give them a huge advantage: long NVDA. Also long TSM as the actual manufacturer of Apple's custom silicon, but damn it, I should be looking for shorts!)\n\nNNN: It's already gone down quite a lot, but they are still paying a hefty dividend.

MU looks like it's been trading sideways for a while despite all the AMD/Intel bullshit, so is it going to pop soon or what?\n\nI don't like doing research, or learning about the stock market because this shit is gay and rigged. I just like overhearing things from smart people and YOLO'ing calls on them. It has actually made me hundreds of thousands of dollars in a couple years so I think my strategy works quite well actually.\n\nThinking about buying a ton of 80c 1/15... smart or retarded?",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed\u2019s anticipated policy framework review.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we know the Fed\u2019s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You\u2019re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed\u2019s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed\u2019s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.\n*****\n&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let\u2019s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they\u2019re not going to stop it,\u201d said Caron. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay there for awhile. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Where\u2019s the stimulus?\n&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the thing I\u2019m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the politics are shifting beneath that.\u201d He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.\n*****\n&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.\n*****\n&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,\u201d said Keon. \u201cAs the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don\u2019t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It\u2019s not panicking about it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. \u201cAs the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. \u201cDemocrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,\u201d said Mills.\n*****\n&gt; # It\u2019s the economy\n&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.\n*****\n&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.\n*****\n&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0FgKliy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yHvkn2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L2S9kUV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kgk42Nv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMOmbjC.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kCvYfYX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jwR8nq6.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nSC6K2N.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/bwcCQMYv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/yxfJ72fy/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nr453Zw/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs\n\n&gt; \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d\n\n&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThis will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn\u2019t a shock to see new highs this quickly.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there\u2019s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early \u201880s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early \u201890s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February \u201961, July \u201980, November \u201982, and March \u201991. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)\n\n&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.\n\n&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.\n\n&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion.

Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays\n\n&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.\n\n&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.\n\n&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**\n\n&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven\u2019t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they\u2019ve actually given us credit for coining the \u201ctriple play\u201d term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.\n\n&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGhxT3rxKxc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCwfvNh2iXU))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$BIG** \n&gt; * **$COTY** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$SPLK**\n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$TOL** \n&gt; * **$VMW** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$FLWS** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FKXPQh9j/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST INCREASE IN EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/G3q2ZwT4/erincrease1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RwgQ9SD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mvBOGth.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY6k2e0.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rx2gJbQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zKSTcN5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/B3hFxJN.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wqQ6cS6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tln4z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7xetbo6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Buy Co., Inc. $114.00\n&gt; **Best Buy Co., Inc.

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

They do business  in all parts of the globe, up until now.  TSMC are wise to the China debacle and are outright voicing that they are with U.S.  They will no longer be advancing any new contracts with Huawei.  This is an implicit move to show good faith to the FIVE EYES, bolstering an already tight pact with the United States.  This is a promise to all TSMCs' Clients that TSMC will protect the (expensive research &amp; development) designs via upholding customary Intellectual Property Rights.  \n\nTSMC has a leading edge on its' Samsung and ARM competitors. Their process for controlling the amount of un-wanted matter pervading the nanometer construction, is unparalleled as much as their ability to manufacture any design submitted.\n\nU.S. has reciprocated and has slated construction of a new Fabrication Plant, to be headed up by TSMC, to be built in Arizona.  \n\nThis is a BUY and HOLD.  TSMC will be at $200 April 2021\n\nAs is AMD, INTEL, Applied Materials (obviously NVDIA)\n\nP.S.\n\nIf you haven't seen the youtube inside TSMC, you should.  It's nearly totally automated.  Machines that cover an accumulative distance of 3X around the globe, everyday.\n\nYes, INTEL has On-Shore Fabrication Plants - But they are a ways from updating their processes to catch up to TSMC and it's an expensive overhaul not to mention some of the leaders who've made Intel what it is, have recently left.
