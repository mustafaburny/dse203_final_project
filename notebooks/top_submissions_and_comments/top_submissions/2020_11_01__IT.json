SVM/??? here with another fuckin banger. LET'S GOOOO!!!!!\n\n# Introduction:\n\nThe market is going to tank. Let me just give a bit of background so you know why my opinion is better than yours...\n\nI am not a bear. I am not a bull. I go where the market tells me to go, I bet where it tells me to bet. And right now, the indicators are telling me to take a strong bearish position. So that's what I have been doing.\n\nI've been trading more than 20 years. I was trading the great financial crash while most of you were watching fucking Spongebob or whatever the fuck you kids jerked it to. This is not my primary job, but I make a good deal of cash on the side every month, timing the market and swing trading broad market ETFs. I do my research, I know my shit, and I rarely touch your shitty meme stocks. I'm doing you all a favor of once again sharing my insights into this market, so you too can share in my profits and maybe learn a thing or two.\n\nI will lay this out as cleanly as I can, offering multiple premises for my bearish bet and explaining them in detail. I've covered some of this in the past, but wanted to consolidate everything and more in one place. **This post will be long. If you want to cry about that rather than thank me for my service, you will go broke soon and deserve it cuz you are a lazy fuck.** PRESSING FORWARD!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Primary Bearish Premises:**\n\n**Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued (Macro)**\n\n**Premise 2: SPY is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes (TA)**\n\n**Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money You Retards (Facts)**\n\n**Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary (Theory)**\n\n**Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting (Data)**\n\n**Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks (Data)**\n\n**Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High (Data)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued\n\nThere are plenty of small, detail arguments for a bearish position. Covid cases rising, election uncertainty, stimulus failing, and so on. Plenty of others have made this case, so I won't focus on the small scale issues such as these.\n\nWhat I want to give you is a larger, macro picture. Because the market is simply overvalued, period. The market has become divorced from the overall economy. I understand tech, and why they have a bullish case for growth in the face of Covid lockdowns... My point here is that you need some REAL WORLD measures to tie \"future earnings\" down to reality, to prevent irrational euphoria from taking over your mind.\n\nThere are plenty of indicators out there showing that stocks are overvalued. We could talk about insane P/E ratios, about euphoric meme stock flops like NKLA, and so on. The metric I'm going to present here is not new by any stretch. It isn't unique or original. But it is undeniably useful, and carries strong weight, whether modern traders wish to shun it and its originator or not. I'm talking about the Buffet Indicator.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oem2uhz714061.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1f7e97544eba52859b986af68b4b80556660e43\n\nFor those of you new to this concept, it is simply the total stock market valuation divided by GDP. The point is to compare total market valuations with some hard, trailing, real-world metric, in this case GDP. When market valuations uncouple strongly from actual market conditions, it is a strong signal of irrational stock valuations. And that presents opportunity for those paying attention.\n\nNote that **this chart has already been detrended down to account for historically rising P/E ratios**, and it still shows a strongly overvalued market, equal to what was seen during the DotCom bubble. That's bad news, folks.\n\nThis is the REAL issue in the present market, and why buyers are becoming exhausted. Covid, instability, elections, stimulus... These are all just catalysts to give that equity bubble a little prick. Only the dumbest of the dumb are still \"buying the dip\" under current market conditions, which means mostly clueless retail gamblers on WSB. All these perma-bulls are doing is offering liquidity to the institutional investors to help get them out of their positions. In the end, we all know who is left holding the bag.\n\n# Premise 2: The Market is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes\n\nI'm not a big believer in technical analysis. Most of it is bullshit, astrological voodoo if you ask me. But some of it works, and when technical analysis works, it is simply being used as a proxy for assessing market sentiment and emotions. Let's take a closer look at the teaser SPY chart I posted above.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h0ndq2a914061.png?width=1808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fe30a5ad23952719c69c6634debe7fe8c0832af\n\nAs you can see, the market has been repeatedly rejecting multiple new highs. This process was briefly interrupted by positive vaccine news. We breached a new high on Pfizer vaccine results, but even that new high was instantly rejected and resulted in a sudden reversal selloff. The Moderna vaccine news created another short rally, lower than the Pfizer high, and that too was followed by a selloff. **In other words, the market is continually rejecting current market valuations.** As they should be, if you were following the point above. We are running on vaccine news fumes, and those will not last long. If you develop an instinct for these things, you can almost feel it in your gut: The market WANTS to head down.\n\nIf this isn't the top, it is close to it. $366.77 will very likely be the high for SPY for the year, and will soon unwind downwards.\n\n# Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money\n\nI know this will come as a shock to most of you idiots but the fucking money printer does NOT GO BRRRRR.\n\nThe Fed has to follow the laws that govern it's actions. The Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print cash and hand it out. Go ahead and read the Federal Reserve Act, and take a look at the Fed's actions, for proof of this. It doesn't even have the authority to print cash to buy corporate bonds or anything else.\n\nWhat the Fed \"prints\" is called \"reserves.\"\n\n[ Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/8ibo0kud14061.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=626a1464cd76296ee9d435a5c69f182e4286f9d6)\n\nSo what, you say? So everything. The key point about reserves is that they cannot be spent like cash can. When a bank gets reserve funds in its reserve account at the Fed, it CANNOT SPEND that money. All the bank can do is use that account as collateral to lend against. Which means **if the banks are not lending, those QE funds are NOT entering the economy.** They might as well not exist. And banks are not lending, as we will see below.\n\nThis is the counter argument to all the ignorant retail traders who will argue that the Fed is \"backstopping\" stocks, or that the Fed will not \"allow\" the market to crash. The Fed has no power to print money, and therefore no power to buy stocks, and therefore no power to prevent a crash. The Fed's power is illusory, but enough people buy the illusion to make it effective. That won't last forever.\n\nJust think about it. If Fed actions and QE really made stocks rally the way people claim it does, why isn't the Japan Nikkei constantly breaking new all time highs???\n\n# Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary\n\nQuantitative Easing is not Cash. In fact, QE is deflationary.\n\nHere is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against.\n\nIn fact, it's worse than that. Because the Fed is removing assets from the open market, and not paying cash for them. It is purchasing liquid assets with illiquid reserves. Despite all the Fed's talk about \"creating liquidity,\" what the Fed is actually doing is REMOVING liquidity from the system!\n\nWhy would they do this? Answer: To lower interest rates. Don't take my word for it, the Fed explains this itself!\n\n[ Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained ](https://preview.redd.it/bzl5jfpf14061.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4c96c8e3b741867281f43b5472c634c85cba5bf)\n\nSee, the Fed has to follow the laws that govern its actions. Despite what the public believes, the Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print money and hand it out. The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through **credit expansion.** So the Fed does everything it can to reduce interest rates, both by setting reserve rates near zero and by using QE to drive rates down further.\n\nOnly when credit expansion revives will we begin to see inflation and a true recovery. The Fed knows their hands are tied, which is why they keep hammering Congress to pass more stimulus.\n\nPerhaps the greatest strength of the Fed is in \"forward guidance.\" The Fed simply uses words to convince the public that money is being printed, that inflation is coming, so that people go out and spend and buy assets. They are playing a trick on the public, and the trick is working. People actually believe inflation is coming, that stocks are being held up by the Fed, that money is pouring into the system. The public is wrong on every count.\n\nThe Fed is trying to contract credit markets in order to lower interest rates in order to eventually spur lending in order to eventually create inflation. But in the meantime, QE is deflationary. As stated above, if reserve funds are not being lent out by the banks, they do not enter the economy, and thus QE serves a deflationary role. Let's take a look at the next premise, that banks are contracting the credit markets.\n\n# Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting\n\nThe question of whether banks are lending or not with their QE reserves is simply a matter of looking at the data. Practically every data source we can point to suggests contracting credit conditions. This means QE reserves are not entering the economy, and therefore are not producing inflation nor holding up stocks.\n\n**The SLOOS data from the Fed, Oct. 2020:**\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/data\\/sloos\\/sloos-202010-table-1.htm](https://preview.redd.it/pt6xz8wg14061.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4de834db13e36878f58154dbe44010b2777743b0)\n\nReal Estate lending is booming, you say? Not so....\n\n**Banks Lending is TIGHTENING:**\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/data\\/documents\\/sloos-202010-charts.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/95wkopaj14061.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb6dcc0329897ca807477b5506786e5edba4b70e)\n\nNote: The decline near the end doesn't represent growth in credit, but represents a reduction in the RATE of tightening.\n\n**Consumer Demand for Loans is SHRINKING:**\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/data\\/documents\\/sloos-202010-charts.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/6d29h9dk14061.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73842070279db79f47a95b1d5c5b1eaeaef08498)\n\n**Even Credit Card debt growth is negative!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73j9n0fl14061.png?width=1585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6328ef22e4a84f0a32b419c35eeacc5238911d24\n\n# Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks\n\nIf you are like me, you look forward to the H.8 data every Friday from the Fed (yeah right haha). A continuing trend in that data, month after month after month, is that major banks in the US have been loading up on bonds with no end in sight. They are piling more and more cash into safe assets, now up to a whopping $4.6 TRILLION in securities.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/releases\\/h8\\/current\\/default.htm](https://preview.redd.it/tn38ss3p14061.png?width=1219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc1c06695685a883599315abc9e36047128e687)\n\nMeanwhile, retail traders (that means you) keep piling into stocks at all time highs. A record amount of cash was dumped into the market after the vaccine news breaks. I'm just gonna go ahead and call it now. This is the top.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.bloomberg.com\\/news\\/articles\\/2020-11-13\\/stock-funds-get-record-44-5-billion-inflows-on-vaccine-optimism](https://preview.redd.it/xogj0z2q14061.png?width=1314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c466b29277d6f047781fd9156bd476b3b1c011f1)\n\n# Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High\n\nI bring this up just to reiterate another real-world metric that is gloomy as fuck and yet completely ignored from market valuations. Why are stocks breaking all-time highs when we still have MILLIONS more unemployed than we did this time last year? Hello McFly?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jda435zq14061.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3929064c0e9d6ae120201ad4295e02cca2bdcf45\n\n# Conclusion:\n\n**Shit's fucked up son.** Real world economy is still in shambles. Market is more overvalued than it was during the DotCom boom. Still millions unemployed. The market is topping off and rejecting highs again and again. The Fed is not printing money and not backstopping assets, despite claims to the contrary. We are heading down, folks!\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**SPY 350p 12/18**\n\n**VXX 22c 12/18**\n\nAlso anything else that strikes your fancy. IWM, GLD, SLV puts are all fine (dollar is going to rise). Longer dated TLT calls will print as well due to QE reducing bond yields, eventually. Go longer or shorted dated depending on personal risk tolerance.\n\n**Timing can be difficult. My strategy is to periodically enter bearish positions when short-term indicators look good, and hope to eventually time the major dump. If things begin to stabilize short-term I exit the position quickly with a small gain or, rarely, a small loss.**\n\nSee: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkm5jq/the\\_bears\\_arent\\_done\\_folks\\_these\\_diamond\\_hands/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkm5jq/the_bears_arent_done_folks_these_diamond_hands/)",

        "selftext": "There's really nothing more to say. I haven't been happy in my 1 year-relationship. My girlfriend probably moved in with me with the expectation that I'll **pay her $40k Nursing School debt THAT SHE NEVER EVEN GRADUATED FROM (and she never told me about this debt**)**.** She was working as a receptionist but quit when we moved in because of 'mental health issues'. \n\nHonestly I've taken her to a psychologist, cared for her, even took some leave just to spend time with her and help her recover. I give her alone time when she asks for it. And when I'm at home, I always do the chores and ask her if she's game to go eat something nice and spend more time together.\n\nOne day, I pull up to our condo and my door is open. I see some other *fucking guy* leaving my house, and he looks like he's been on a million different drugs.\n\nPissed, I tell ask her about it and she gets angry at me, asking me why I'm never home and why I always abuse her. She dodges the question over and over and says that it's just 'a friend' she opened the door to because no one was home to keep her company. This happens about 2 more times and one day, I confront the guy in the front door and turns out he's '**rented**'. \n\nFirst off. Where did she get the money? Has she been renting guys out with the little \"salary\" I'm giving her to spend while I'm working my ass off  providing for both of us? I'm a freaking security guard earning $19 CAD/hr. Which is not bad but not sustainable for a marriage where one person pays for two.\n\nI was pissed to hell. \n\nThere was something she didn't know about, though. I've been stashing away a little bit of money, starting with 5K CAD after finding about this reddit site. At that time, I was honestly depressed because I had a hard time paying for our condo and with debt. And perhaps that fueled me with all-inning that 5K with a PLTR options play (call) that expired Nov 27, 2020. Oct 30, 2020 when I bought multiple calls for PLTR it rockets all the way to **wakanda** and to **jupiter**. I'm now 1012% up. I cash out before Citron sell it. **(DW I'll add that money to buying PLTR STOCKS**, less riskier than doing options). \n\n***How does this relate to my girlfriend?***\n\nIt relates. It relates because I'm going to leave her fucking ass. Actually, even if PLTR doesn't his $40 I'm STILL going to leave her ass. I have to pay spousal support but when I looked at the calculator online, it amounts to about $82 per month for **0.5** to **1 year**. I'll do it and then cut all ties. And that bitch'll have to handle her debt herself. I'll cut all ties and leave without a fuckin word. \n\nIt's not like we were married or anything. It's not like we are obligated to one another. I haven't committed to her through marriage. And this is my decision. \n\nSo her, that guy, and CITRON, can go suck my hard cock throbbing because of the 5k liters of blood that gushed in, making it hard, when I saw PLTR go from $10.12/share to \\~$27-\\~32/share. Goodbye and I'll see you Monday when that shit pumps to the moon and beyond.",

[Today it is at $22](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ciic).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all these EV stocks popping up, \n\n# my next play is the merger of $THCB and Microvast \n\n([Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-11-13/tuscan-holdings-corp-announces-intent-to-combine-with-microvast-inc)). You might say, the merger isn't confirmed yet. That is true, but that's how you maximize profit before the news sets in. Bloomberg has never been wrong about any SPAC rumour except once (Topgolf). THCB will be able to sign an extension by Dec 3rd, likely to be beforehand)\n\nRight now, without an agreement confirmation, $THCB has barely popped yet, shares and warrants are still cheap. There is virtually 0 downside risk, THCB shares are currently at $10.44, like most SPACs, you can redeem shares to $10 cash if it fails through, which is unlikely to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So what is Microvast?**\n\nTLDR: EV Battery Maker based in Texas, business focuses in Asia (China market is $$). One of the best EV battery techs right now. Already has 100M revenue this year.\n\nIt makes EV batteries based on Lithium Titanium Oxide (LTO) chemistry. Compared to the incumbent Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries, Microvast's batteries have longer life, shorter charging times, and offer substantial lower cost of ownership by eliminating swapping station infrastructures required by buses running on LFP batteries.\n\n[Their batteries powered the electric buses used in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, it expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue this financial year.](https://www.reuters.com/article/microvast-ma-tuscan-holdings/ev-battery-maker-microvast-to-go-public-through-spac-merger-idINL4N2HZ3SI) Most other EV companies don't even have revenue yet. [THCB has a Return On Equity of 48.48%. This is amongst the best returns in the industry. The industry average is 11.30%. THCB outperforms 85% of its industry peers.](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/THCB?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=THCB&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking)\n\nIf you missed out on CIIC train, this will be the next hype play. I don't expect it to have big jumps in the next few days, but the merger agreement with Microvast should come out within the next 2 weeks. Get in early before it comes out and jumps up 50%. Shares and warrants are both cheap as fuck right now. Once merger is announced, THCB will easily go to \\~$20 range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: Load up on THCB shares and warrants. (I am going 30|70).",

        "selftext": "Institutional ownership in this company went from 1% to almost 8% within a week(because it was a Direct Listing) and looking at the price charts, their average purchase range should be around $13-15.\n\nThis gives a floor for us retail investors and speculators out there. Price is UNLIKELY to go below this floor.\n\nMore institutional ownership is quite probably coming soon. This means money.\n\nARK, Soros sold a stake in JPM(probably, I forgot) to jump in PLTR.\n\nMorgan Stanley raised the price target yet downgraded the stock, I don't know if it\u2019s a dick move from their part to try to buy it at a lower price or maybe I am just over thinking.\n\nLong term considerations:\nThis company is structured in a way in which the founders would gain insane amount of money if this stock prints(KINDA like how Musk benefitted from TSLA stock price)\n\nPlus the total control of the founders(much like lizard man Zuck have over FB) mean shareholders cannot pull any funny business.

One example, an oil major would save $1B annually for using Palantir's software.\n\nThey have an almost 10+ years head start in the business and the fact that it\u2019s so deeply entrenched with the government means it ain't gonna become bankrupt.\n\nI mean this shit can surpass NFLX or TSLA valuations if Karp's vision and various statements are realised.\n\nAlso remember, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp do not just work for money, they already have had a boatload(literally) of money and for them to stick to a product for nearly 17 years is definitely telling.\n\nThis company probably wouldn\u2019t enter the Chinese market or more likely wouldn\u2019t take any Chinese government contract.\n\nTheir margins are insane(forget NFLX, AAPL, TSLA etc) when their customers enter the scaling phase and their products are sticky as hell.\n\nShort term considerations:\nThere's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares.\n\nRegardless, a lot of employees could exercise options constantly that they received as compensations as they didn\u2019t get the chance to do so earlier at a fair price.\n\nThey raised their guidance. And do you know what market loves the most? Raised guidance. That's why even though market sold off by retail profit takers at first then it quickly went back to where it was. Monday could be higher.\n\nThis stock probably hasn\u2019t really discovered its true pricing because of the still low institutional ownership and employees stock options activity.\n\nThe market(by market I mean some journos and analysts) still seems to misunderstand their product and think they are a data mining company, a consultant company, a fancy government contractor for specialist software etc. It is not any of them. I will let you discover yourself what this company is. It's kind of like how some boomer analysts still think a certain company is just a car company.\n\nHow to play this shit?\nI think leaps or outright buying shares(then selling puts to generate income and buy more) is the best way, regardless, this is a matter I don't want to comment too much, I have given you some insight, now you do your own thing.\n\nRemember, this isn\u2019t NIO, it\u2019s a much more bigger fish than that(if they can realise their long term goals).\n\nSome resources for you to dive slightly deep.\n\n[Third quarter earnings presentation(pdf)](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf)\n\n[Palantir S-1 Filing(SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)\n\n[STILL low institutional ownership](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PLTR&amp;subView=institutional)",

        "selftext": "I am someone who has spent over a decade in hedge funds and then in private equity\n\nIf you want to understand what it is going on. You have to understand that the largest driving force in the background in which you are operating in is the shift from active managers to passive managers. The vanguard crowd has been winning for more than a decade and now we are at a point where nearly all new money entering the market comes in the form of passive ETFs and index funds. \n\nAnd here is where the fun begins. millennials and new investors have a extreme time preference for passive management while baby boomers largely invested in active managers. So in the past few years, all new money entering the market is passive and all old money leaving the market is active. Hedge fund and mutual fund managers are shedding AUM while the likes of vanguard and ETFs have been gaining AUM.\n\n So why does this matter?\n\nWell, the old operating model of securities analysis was predicated on value judgements. If a stock falls 20%, your money manager tasks a analyst to runs a DCF/comps analysis, and tells you it is undervalued by 10% based on the latest assessment, and that the fund should buy some shares. The old buy high sell low, with a dash of analysis added in. That was how things use to run anyways. But in the world of passive investing, price becomes the only judgement as to whether it should be added or subtracted, there is no analysis of valuation metrics, fundamentals of the business or even if it is a fraud or not. There are no analysts digging into the company, calling up suppliers, doing channel checks. It is just pure automation, stock goes up, it gets reweighted high, buy. Stock goes down, it gets reweighted down, sell. The market has become dumber over time. And the people who do the work do not get paid for it, because more and more of the market is passive. So undervalued things remain undervalued, and overvalued things get more overvalued. \n\nThere are essentially three players left in this market, of which only two are active investors. You have the passive money, which now drives 90%+ of the market. You have the small remaining active investor base, who have been shedding AUM and are desperate to hold on to their jobs and are forced to actually follow indexes to avoid getting fired, and what their doing which is arbitraging value, no longer pays off. Then you have people like WSB and stocktwits, where people chase momentum in everything from large tech to chinese frauds. What you are seeing today is the two remaining active groups fighting to control the flows of the passive money (who simply follows whichever side has more momentum). \n\nThis is why we are in a world where TESLA can go up valuation by 10x despite revenue only increase by 15%. We are in a world where large cap gets larger. We are in a world where a bunch of degenerates gambling on FDs, which then drives gamma covering by market makers will create an escalating feedback loop in which passive money piles in, making it into a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nSo thank the Bogleheads, you have the keys to the Asylum. You are now running the trillion dollar global equity markets. The memes are now real and you are now the captain of Wall Street.",

        "selftext": "Ok, so TSLA will be included in S&amp;P 500 in Dec 21. Old news. Around $100B(almost 1/5th of its market cap) of TSLA would need to be purchased(some active funds may have already purchased) based on current stock price.\n\nThe only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&amp;P 500 inclusion thingy. After that, I don't know what will even move this stock. They freakin surpassed Berkshire and could surpass Facebook(for a short time)!!!\n\nToday they will announce whether to include TSLA in two sessions or in one session.\n\n[This is what happened when Yahoo was included(which is comparable to TSLA's inclusion as they have had relatively comparable size in comparison to S&amp;P 500's size). Although I believe TSLA will rise again after some time, unlike Yahoo.](https://imgur.com/a/1qj22eR)\n\nAfter the trading sessions, expect a big dip. As a lot of speculators this year have bought into TSLA precisely to front-run the index investors.\n\nAlso, the trade date Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla\u2019s inclusion, investors said. (this paragraph copied straight from wsj)\n\nSo, I guess don't be a fool(unless there are some tax implications, which I don't have); buy the rumour, sell the news. TSLA will completely tank after the inclusion.\n\nAlso, remember NIO etc kind of benefit from the TSLA hype, so be very careful you all about them.\n\nI don't think if you don't have any immediate tax implications, there wouldn't be much value holding TSLA for the longer term as there are better long term plays. And when or if TSLA reaches $700 or higher(I know I am very bullish, but that's why I am still holding it) there would be almost no point in holding it any longer.\n\nSome special points to remember:\n\n* TSLA already jumped 40% after its inclusion news broke out and had been steadily climbing before it due to rumour that it will be included in the index and Softbank's trade earlier this year.\n* TSLA can issue more shares, especially in this valuation. I mean why wouldn't they, lol.\n\nI know posts that say anything negative about TSLA gets downvoted but be careful about your TSLA shares or options!\n\nDisclaimer: I am long TSLA shares and call options. I am also long PLTR(long leaps too) and some other meme stocks which I am not mentioning cause my post gets removed somehow and I am not sure why(so you know I don't give a damn about valuations, although I am kind of an early mover, so all of them are at a very profitable position).",

How does this happen? Shares can be borrowed, sold, then borrowed from the buyer (making two people technically borrowing the same 1 share). This is insane and has never happened before without causing a short squeeze. (look up volkswagen short squeeze chart to see what it looks like when short interest exceeds 100%). \n\n[https:\\/\\/finance.yahoo.com\\/quote\\/GME\\/key-statistics?p=GME](https://preview.redd.it/n8sr8ifnww161.png?width=840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f3ef131a7d5bdee19acd4c6bd8196fad9c66aa)\n\nSo if gamestop stock goes up, the shorts will have to cover, which is literally impossible since theyve shorted over 100% of shares, so the price will be driven to an absolute retard height. But, whats gonna make gamestop go up? how are the shorts wrong?\n\n**Consoles**\n\nWell, the obvious is console sales, but thats not really it. Yes, the consoles will help, however more importantly there are key indicators that gamestop is not going bankrupt. Recently, they just paid off a metric fuckton of debt *voluntarily* which means they have the cash to do that, aka not bankrupt. People are literally camping out at gamestop for consoles. They will not struggle.\n\n**Cohen**\n\nAlso, they are getting the help from ryan cohen, who successfully competed with amazon by launching an online pet store called Chewy, which made him a billionaire. This is good news for gamestop because he will help pivot them from brick and mortar towards a more digital world, which means gamestop now has realistic growth prospects. Also, there is rumors that cohen will announce a tender offer, which would immediately trigger a short squeeze, end of story. Cohen has openly critiqued the BoD about their '20th century mindset' so it is likely he is going to take over soon. \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Also, massive completely random spikes in volume off seemingly no news indicate that cohen is buying up shares. ](https://preview.redd.it/e19xcu0qxw161.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f7c9aeb4df33cc2d416f7fda3b2e8ee257cc43)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positioning**\n\nThey have also positioned themselves to benefit from non traditional 'brick and mortar' revenue streams. Another thing that gamestop has is online revenue sharing with sony, which means they will be benefiting from digital game sales. They also just announced that they would be selling TVs on their website, showing that they are positioning themselves to compete as an online retailer. \n\n[https:\\/\\/www.theverge.com\\/2020\\/10\\/15\\/21517970\\/gamestop-revenue-sharing-microsoft-xbox-digital-downloads-games](https://preview.redd.it/cijd0o25xw161.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=310955852b0224bfff2fc36825d50a741475f46c)\n\n[https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/)\n\n\\^Link about TVs. \n\n**The move:**\n\nBuy as many shares as you can and hold. Set a limit sell on all your shares for at least $500, to make sure that you dont miss the squeeze. That alone would be a 3,233% gain.  \n\nImportant note: This quarters earnings will likely not be a catalyst for a short squeeze. It is likely that there will be a run up and then small dump after. Remember, the shorts are working hard to fuck over longs. Dont be a retard and fall for it. Buy up the dips. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: BUY GAMESTOP SHARES, HOLD WITH A LIMIT SELL OF AT LEAST $500/share**",

        "selftext": "Why should you listen to me? I'm either a licensed pharmacist who makes a living analyzing clinical outcomes data or a full-blown autist who has lost thousands making reckless plays (I'm actually both)\n\nSo I was looking through Pfizer\u2019s well-guarded Phase 3 COVID vaccine data and came to the following conclusions:\n\nPfizer stated they achieved an incredible \u201c90% efficacy\u201d in the trial which has enrolled 43,538 patients, 38,955 of which received both required doses. But what does \u201c90% efficacy\u201d really mean? They are referring to the \u2018Relative Risk Reduction\u2019 which is a number with no external validity. Essentially, RRR, is a way to inflate what the real-world effectiveness of an intervention is by removing the good outcomes of the non-intervention arm of a trial. It is the incidence difference between the placebo and intervention arms, divided by the incidence difference of the intervention arm.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a 2% chance of having a brick fall and hit you in the head, but there is an intervention available that reduces your risk of a brick hitting you in the head from 2% to 1%. The RRR = (2% - 1%) / 2% = 50%. When in reality, your absolute risk is reduced by 1% (ARR = 2% - 1% = 1%). \n\nNow let\u2019s apply this to the Pfizer data. Pfizer only reported a few numbers: 90% effective, 94 positive cases in both arms, and 38955 patients receiving both doses. Trial arm splits are always very close to 50/50, and knowing those 3 numbers, we can do some math and come to the following data table:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Placebo (No Vaccine)| Intervention (Vaccine) |\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|COVID Cases |85|9|\n|Enrolled |19,388|19,567|\n|Outcome Incidence  | 0.438416% | 0.045996% |\n\nAs a double-check, the RRR = (0.438416% - 0.045996%) / 0.438416% = 89.5% (round up to 90%)\n\nBut let\u2019s dive a little deeper. Based on this trial, there is a 0.44% chance to contract COVID-19 without the vaccine, and a 0.046% chance to contract COVID-19 with the vaccine. Your absolute risk reduction would be 0.39%, which means getting the COVID-19 vaccine reduces your chance of contracting the disease by 0.39% (0.0039). \n\nSo how many vaccines would we have to give to prevent 1 COVID case? This is called a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and provides the number of interventions (vaccines) required to prevent one outcome (infection). NNT is calculated as 1/ARR, then rounding up to the next highest whole number. The NNT for Pfizer\u2019s vaccines = 1/0.0039 = 256.4 = 257 patients must receive both vaccines in order to prevent one case. Sounds bad, right? Well, it gets worse. Roughly 7% of each COVID case leads to a hospitalization, and roughly 2% of cases lead to death. This means that to prevent 1 hospitalization, 3,672 patients must receive both vaccines (257 / 0.07), and to prevent 1 death, 12,580 patients must receive both vaccines (257 / 0.02). \n\nThe intervention arm in this trial, at best, prevented 1.6 deaths (19,567 / 12,580). \n\nTo prevent the roughly 240,000 COVID deaths in the US, over 3 billion vaccines would have to be given (240,000 x 12,580). \n\nGuess what? Yeah, it still gets worse. The primary outcome of this trial was a COVID-19 infection within SEVEN DAYS OF THE SECOND VACCINE. So technically speaking, any effectiveness of this vaccine is only for 7 days and you could essentially be completely vulnerable again (this likely isn\u2019t the case, but still is still a possibility). \n\nModerna's data ain't much better. Their NNT is roughly 177. \n\nI didn't even mention the supply chain nightmare Pfizer's vaccine will cause since it needs to be stored at -70^(o)F.\n\nHere is more bad news, there is virtually no long-term safety data available for these vaccines. Long story short, The FDA isn't going to approve this anytime soon. \n\nPositions: $SPY $325p 3/31/21, $PFE $30p 7/16/21, $MRNA $50p 1/21/22",

        "selftext": "Posting on a throwaway account, for obvious reasons.\n\nIn 2013, my uncle passed away from pancreatic cancer.  In his will, he left my twin brother and I  $100,000 each.  \n\nMy brother and I were talking about our different investments at the time, and how we were going to invest our new money.  For the last decade or so, I\u2019ve been a silver enthusiast, and I argued that silver was, IMO, the best alternative investment to stocks and bonds.  He had just learned about Bitcoin and was adamant that the return could be exponential.  I had vehemently argued against Bitcoin, saying that it was pure speculation and would be a total waste of money.  I was so sure that Bitcoin would crash.\n\nWell, he ended up investing about 50k into Bitcoin around then (when Bitcoin was ~$100 each), for over 500 coins.  I, on the other, invested most of it into stocks, and about 30k into silver.  \n\nHis 50k Bitcoin investment, which was made within months of the same time as my 30k silver investment, is now worth over $10 million.  My 30k silver investment  in 2013 is now worth about 26k, with my entire net worth below 100k.  His wealth in Bitcoin alone is more than 100 times greater than my entire net worth.  \n\nHe has never sold any of his Bitcoins.  He\u2019s never even traded them for other crypto currencies.  His job pays him very well, so he\u2019s never really had liquidity issues.  He has still 500+ coins, and he\u2019s going to retire soon.  He is planning to sell his house, travel, and live as an investor. \n\nNow, he did give me one Bitcoin.  And I will not sell it.  As happy as I am for him, though, it really hurts to hear about his fortune and bright future, and not be jealous.  I\u2019ve stopped attending family events (him too), because I can\u2019t get over the overwhelming thought of \u201chey, you should\u2019ve done what your brother did\u201d, at every waking moment.  It\u2019s extremely depressing.  I try to be thankful for what I do have, and I try to be thankful since I know that many other people in the world have it way worse.  But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get over it.  The thought that\n\u201cif you made the same investment, you wouldn\u2019t have to work anymore\u201d always comes to me, in every area of my life.  I always think to myself, you wouldn\u2019t have to work, or you wouldn\u2019t have money issues like this if you just invested a little into Bitcoin.  This thought is especially pervasive whenever I\u2019m at work, and it is a crushing feeling.  \n\nAny advice on how to cope?",

        "selftext": "DD - Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd ($PSTH)\n\nIn recent weeks there has been a lot of interesting action in the stock market as it relates to $PSTH. Despite a lot of noise and action and speculation if you go looking, the major news outlets and press have been quiet. This DD makes the argument (based on the available evidence) that Bill Ackman\u2019s blank cheque company, PSTH, will announce a merger with Stripe, securing a \\~20% position in the company and taking it public.\n\nThis can be discredited as conjecture, but most things on WSB can be and are before they are realized. There is simply too much evidence here in favor of this happening to be ignored any longer.\n\nKey Information/Timeline of Events:\n\n\\- In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH \u2013 the SPAC raised $4B in proceeds making it the biggest SPAC ever.\n\n\\- The SPAC is designed very differently than others and incentivizes long term holding. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional merger is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long term holding of the company and is referenced in the \"tontine\" name - look it up, pretty cool.\n\n\\- Ackman has given several interviews since the listing of PSTH arguing that they are very well positioned to target and capture a unicorn (large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company.) Early speculation included AirBnB. While Ackman held talks with the company, they didn\u2019t get to the point where his people got an inside look at the financials and he basically said they had no idea what they were dealing with despite liking how the company looked on the outside. AirBnB now, for many reasons remains unlikely.\n\n\\- Ackman in the same videos talked up Stripe as a quality company but one not ready to go public, specifically citing managerial deficits.\n\n\\- Stripe has been talked up by some in the press as the next Google. They control a large percentage of online payments at present.\n\n\\- Ackman has publicly disclosed his biggest misses as companies that make money based on money, giving Visa/Mastercard as the obvious example.\n\n\\- In the weeks since those interviews, several key events have taken place as follows:\n\no Following Ackman comments, Stripe initiates a dramatic position filling hiring spree with focus on positions needed to go public/SPAC\n\no Square executive joins board of PSTH\n\no Seth Klarman ($30B hedge fund manager \u201cthe next Buffet\u201d and noted value investor, disclosed a $400M position in PSTH).\n\no Warren Buffet has slashed his JPM position almost entirely.\n\no Warren Buffet is secretly building a large position and hiding it from the press/pushing filing deadlines as much as possible.\n\no There is a large and undisclosed PSTH somewhere in the market that is not Klarman\u2019s.\n\no In recent days the pre-market movement has been very odd. Several million positions. Pre-market on Friday for example, stock was up nearly 9% for some of the morning. Has consistently hit after-market highs the next day. The data is trending in a very clear direction.\n\nRelevant Documents/Links:\n\n\\- Ackman interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4)\n\n\\- Klarman position: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html)\n\n\\- Buffet leaves JPM: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193)\n\n\\- Buffet secret position: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html)\n\n\\- PSTH (Ackman) recent letter to investors, see PSTH section: [https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf](https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf)\n\n\\- Yolo Capital Mgmt twitter feed outlining much of the same events: [https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt](https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt)\n\nIn the end, we don\u2019t know anything for sure but the evidence here (there is more to dig up, see [u/YOLO](https://new.reddit.com/u/YOLO/), is very compelling). Holding a stake here, whether its Stripe or something else, is likely a play with limited downside and insane upside. The warrant structure (\u201cTontine\u201d) alone is so appealing.\n\nGoodluck.\n\n\\-commons (long-term) and contracts (June 21)",

So the price will skyrocket faster than PLTR or NIO or any other meme in 2020.\n\nRight but what if they don't want to close their shorts all at once. Then nothing happens, right? Yes... and no. As they start buying back the price will rise slowly and some people that did not want to buy will at some point get a margin call. This will force more short sellers to buy (at a lose cause fuck gay bears). And this will accelerate the rising of the price creating more margin calls and so on and so on. Until we run out of short sellers trying to buy. At this point the price will stop increasing. Basically, we only need a small (comapared to 22.70 Mill) amount of people buying to trigger this.\n\nSo there is still a thing that needs to happen a small amount of people need to suddenly buy or close the shorting positions.

Two things can happen either they ace it and people start buying or they screw it up and the price goes down.\n\nFirst scenario it's golden the price starts rolling and GME goes to the moon. The second one sounds bad, right? No, if the price drops by 20% some people might start closing their shorts. Then as that happens the price will bounce back and start the process again.\n\nBasically GME is a ball at the top of the hill right now.

By comparison, gold [**GCZ20,** **-0.39%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/GCZ20?mod=MW_story_quote) has gained 24% in the year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **-0.55%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote) has climbed 4.7% so far in 2020. The S&amp;P 500 index [**SPX,** **-0.47%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) has gained more than 12% and the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index [**COMP,** **-0.21%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/COMP?mod=MW_story_quote) has surged more than 33% over the same period.\n\nStill, bitcoin bears and detractors aren\u2019t hard to find. On Tuesday, Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, and a longtime bitcoin skeptic, on Twitter challenged proponents of the currency to explain to him why bitcoin is worth his attention and not [doomed to collapse](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dalio-says-he-might-be-missing-something-about-bitcoin-challenges-twitter-to-change-his-mind-11605637663).",

        "selftext": "Fellow Betters, if you understand options, move on.\n\nFirst, proud of this community and all the giving it did yesterday.  Truly phenomenal.\n\nI've noticed a lot of people on this sub legitimately don't know what options are or what they do.  This is incredibly concerning, how are we going to get to the moon if we don't know how to build a rocket.  As such, I've decided to write a quick reference options guide to help some of the newer, younger, or less experienced traders as a Christmas present to the sub. If you know what options are, move on.  I'm going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible.  A reference guide.\n\nAs much as we all like loss porn, I like seeing gain porn way more and hate the thought of people losing life savings/tuition money/inheritance because they come to the sub and don't know anything about options but see a ticker with rocket ships and buy a 0 DTE 30% out of the money call with everything they have.  Gotta know how to play blackjack to sit at the table.\n\nDepending on feedback, I may write a few more.  If I get told to fuck off I completely understand, but if some people learn some stuff then I'll continue.  I will be using $MSFT as my example.\n\n* What are options?\n   * The Basics/Buying vs. Selling Options\n   * The Money\n   * Calls Explained\n      * Buying Naked Calls\n      * Selling Naked Calls\n   * Puts Explained\n      * Buying Naked Puts\n      * Selling Naked Puts\n* Options Pricing\n   * Intrinsic Value\n   * Extrinsic Value\n* The Details\n* The Greeks\n* Helpful Links\n\n**Options Explained**\n\n***The Basics***\n\nBuying an option **gives you the right** to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (strike price) on or before the expiration date (European options are specifically on the expiration date).  Buying calls is bullish, buying puts is bearish.  To buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade (premium explained more later).\n\n* If you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy calls.  \n* If you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy puts.\n\nSelling an option **obligates** you to buy (put) or sell (call) 100 shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date, really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option.\n\n* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price, you sell calls.\n* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price, you sell puts.\n\n***The Money***\n\nFor Calls:\n\n* At the Money - A call with a strike price equal to the current stock price\n* In the Money - A call with a strike price BELOW the current stock price, can immediately be exercised\n* Out of the Money - A call with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price.  The stock MUST rise to or above the strike price to be exercised.\n\nFor Puts:\n\n* At the Money - A put with a strike price equal to the current stock price\n* In the Money - A put with a strike price ABOVE the current strike price, can immediately be exercised\n* Out of the Money -  A put with a strike price BELOW the current strike price, must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised\n\n***Calls Explained***\n\nBuying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub, and thus will be covered first.  I will be using $MSFT as my example stock.  $MSFT is currently trading at $215.17 and I believe that the sale of the new XBox around Christmas time will increase the stock price to $230.0 by Christmas.  I would buy a call.  I decide to look at the Dec. 31 options which you can see below.\n\n[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/v1li3ko65u161.png?width=1155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f4953ae3048e58bca84001d3caa2be444b0189)\n\nThis is Robinhood on a computer.  At the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below.\n\n* Strike Price - The price the stock has to rise above to be exercised\n* Break Even - The price the stock has to rise above to not lose money\n* To Break Even - Percent change in the stock required to break even\n* % Change - Daily change in option price in percent\n* Change - Daily change in option price in dollars\n* Price - Price of the option\n\nIn the above example:\n\n* $215 Strike Price - In the Money, could be immediately exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss\n* $217.5 Strike Price - Out of the Money, could NOT be immediately exercised.\n\nThe Break Even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk.  This can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option.  For the 12/31 $230, $230.0 + $1.67 = $231.67.  The option CAN BE EXERCISED BELOW THE BREAK EVEN FOR A LOSS.\n\n***Buying Naked Calls***\n\nOk, so the 12/31 $230.0 strike is what we are going to buy, that is $1.67 dollars PER share, for 100 shares, so the buyer would pay a total of $167.00 for the trade (depending on the bid - ask, explained in ***The Details*** below.)  We go ahead an buy that option for a debit of $167.00.\n\nAs the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:\n\n* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time\n* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time\n* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing (explained in Greeks)\n\nOn 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:\n\n* $MSFT is above the breakeven, we'll say $240.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, the contract would be worth around $10.00 ($240.0 - $230.0 = $10.00).  This is per share! So your profit would be: ($10.00 x 100) - ($167.0) = $833.  The $167.0 is the debit paid for the contract.\n* $MSFT is above the strike but below the breakeven, we'll say $231.00.  The contract will be very close to break even, and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below.  If you are still bullish on $MSFT, this is the ONLY time I would recommend exercising the option to buy the share (AND ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL TO DO SO).  If you are bearish or do not have the capital, your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss.  In this case it would be around $100.  **NOTE: ROBINHOOD RISK MANAGEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SELL OPTIONS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO EXERCISE THEM AND IT IS CLOSE TO THE STRIKE ON THE DAY OF EXPIRATION.**\n* $MSFT is below the strike, hold or sell to avoid max loss.  Your max loss in the trade is $167 dollars, and the stock may run up towards the end of the day.  If $MSFT finishes the day below the strike, the option will expire worthless.\n\n***Selling Naked Calls***\n\nIf you are neutral to bearish on $MSFT because you think the PS5 will outsell the XBox, you could sell the 12/31 $230.0C.  See below.\n\n[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/d8z02ztweu161.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38aef118e5984f02c90185de2e5cc9855c73a4e3)\n\nNotice \"To Break Even\" turns into \"Chance of Profit.\"  This is a calculation using the Greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade.  You sell this call.  This would mean you would be CREDITED with $167 dollars initially.  As the month goes on, if $MSFT goes up in value, you will begin to lose money on the trade, and if you desired to close the trade you would have to Buy to Close, meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for.  If $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, the options contract will decrease and you can Buy to Close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on 12/31.\n\n**SELLING NAKED CALLS CAN BE VERY RISKY.**  If you sell the call, and $MSFT shoots up the next day to $240.0, the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call.  This means that you as the seller are OBLIGATED to sell them 100 shares of $MSFT at $230.  What happens if you don't have them? You have to buy them at the current market price.  So $240.0 x 100 = $24,000.  You would then sell them for $230.0: $23,000. Your max loss on the trade will be $24,000 - $23,000 -$167.0 = $833.  And that is only if the price goes to $240.0.  If the price at expiration is $250, your max loss would be $1,833.  For every $10 increase in underlying, the max loss increases $1,000.  To avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls, to be discussed later.\n\n***Puts Explained***\n\nBuying puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub.  $MSFT is still $215.17, and I believe the new XBox sucks.  I think the stock will fall to $205.0 on or before 12/31.  Below are 12/31 puts.\n\n[Figure 3](https://preview.redd.it/svbfbulzcu161.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41e389a6b8a77e1b71c189615a6fb9acbee41553)\n\nNone of the metrics change, except for what is in and out of the money.\n\n* $217.5 - In the Money, can immediately be exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss\n* $215 - Out of the Money, cannot immediately be exercised\n\n***Buying Naked Puts***\n\nThe 12/31 $210.0 strike is what we are going to buy, so that is $3.58 for 100 shares, so if purchased and filled this would cost us $358.0 dollars.  Note this is much more expensive than the $230.0 call, this is a result of the strike price being much closer to the current stock price.\n\nAs the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:\n\n* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time\n* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time\n* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing\n\nOn 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:\n\n* $MSFT is below the breakeven, we'll say $200.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, worth around ($10.00). ($210.0 - $200.0 = $10.00)  Again, per share, minus the debit, would again get us around $642.  Notice how this trades profit was lower with the same difference in strike price to underlying price on expiration. That is because the premium we paid for this trade was higher.\n* $MSFT is below the strike price but above the breakeven, we'll say $207.0.  The contract will very throughout the day, and unless you have the capital to exercise Robinhood risk management will likely sell the thing whether you like it or not.\n* $MSFT is above the strike price, you can sell to minimize profit OR hold until it expires worthless.\n\n***Selling Naked Puts***\n\nIf you are neutral to bullish on $MSFT because you think the XBox will be meh, you could sell the 12/31 $210.0P.  This means you would be credited with $3.58.  If $MSFT decreases in value, the option price will increase in value, and you will lose money on the trade.  You can hold to expiration or Buy to Close at any time for a loss.  If $MSFT trades sideways or increases in value, the option will decrease in value, and you can Buy to Close for a profit at any time.\n\n**THE SAME RISK APPLIES TO SELLING NAKED PUTS AS NAKED CALLS, BUT IS \"CAPPED\" AS A STOCK CANNOT GO BELOW ZERO.**\n\n***Options Pricing***\n\nThe price of an option has two different parts, intrinsic and extrinsic value.\n\n* Intrinsic Value = |Current Price - Strike Price|\n   * An Out of the Money option has no Intrinsic Value\n   * An In the Money Option has an Intrinsic Value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price. \n   * Example:  $MSFT price: $215.17.  For the 12/31 $212.5C, this option has an Intrinsic Value of $2.67 for each share, or $267.  BUT you can see in Figure 1 it is $7.30, or $730 dollars to buy.  That is where extrinsic value comes into play\n* Extrinsic Value\n   * Effected by theta and implied volatility\n   * Can be calculated by Extrinsic Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value\n   * Theta\n      * The more time an option has to expiration, the higher it is priced.  This is because the underlying stock ($MSFT) has more time to move.\n      * The theta curve accelerates around the 45 day mark, see the figure below.  You can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value, regardless of if it is in or out of the money IT WILL DEPRECIATE\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knprhfu1iu161.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80a6189eafe6f7fb8662cf5cd467d2c9b588af9d\n\n* Implied Volatility - a lot of math goes into this one, but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time\n   * Steady stocks, like $KO, tend to have lower IV. \n   * High growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher IV.\n   * The IV OF EACH OPTION will be different depending on expiration date, how far In or Out of the Money the stock is, and the movement of the underlying.\n   * IV Crush - this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing.  Even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases, decreasing the extrinsic value.  BE CAREFUL IF YOU HOLD OPTIONS OVER A STOCKS EARNINGS.\n\n***The Details***\n\nGoing back to our out of the money 12/31 $230.0C on $MSFT, if you select the option, you will open up the details surrounding that option.  This can be seen below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9jybsf99ju161.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28414c66b7307b4d47e6841693976f068c0af774\n\nThis explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is. From left to right.\n\n* Bid - Highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price\n* Ask - Lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price\n* Mark - Often in between the Bid and Ask, what you see on the main options tree\n* Previous Close - The price of the most recent option sold\n* High - Highest price paid during the trading day for the option\n* Low - Lowest price paid during the trading day for the option\n* Volume - number of contracts traded during the trading day\n* Open Interest - number of total contracts not settled\n\nBid-Ask Spread is the different between the Bid and Ask, in this case $.19.  The closer the bid ask spread, the more likely you are to get an order filled.  Slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock.  If the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call, by the time you enter the order the Bid-Ask Spread might have moved up dramatically, and your order might not get filled.\n\nOpen Interest is important as well.  If very low open interest, Selling or Buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is.\n\nThe lower the open interest and the wider the Bid-Ask Spread is, the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers.  They will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bid/ask and will expect you to do it.  If they are moving millions of options a day, $.10 is a lot to them and they will profit off of it.\n\n***The Greeks***\n\nYou can see the Greeks listed above for this call.\n\n* Delta - how much an options price is expected to change for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Calls have positive delta, puts have negative delta.  If $MSFT goes from $215.0 to $216.0, the price of the option will increase $.1691.  Puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases.  Delta will approach 1 as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike, causing a natural increase in intrinsic value.\n* Gamma - the change in Delta for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike.\n* Theta - change in the option price for every 1 day closer to expiration.  Theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date.  If you hold onto the 12/31 $230C for a day it would decrease in value .06 per contract, so a total of $6.  You can see how this is an options buyers Enemy.\n* Vega - How the implied volatility affects the price of the option.  A drop in vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value.  Compare vega to normal levels by looking at other options of other similar underlying.  Again, BE CAUTIOUS OF IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS.\n* Rho - sensitivity to interest rates, has to do with the U.S. treasury, you have the least control over this and this arguably effects options the least.\n\n***Helpful Links***\n\nHere are some awesome links that will help everyone get better at trading options.\n\n [Options Strategies | Learn To Trade Options - The Options Playbook](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/) \n\n [Investing with Options (robinhood.com)](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/trading/investing-with-options/) \n\n [Options Trading Strategy &amp; Education (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/options-trading-strategy-and-education-4689661) \n\nI hope you find this helpful.

        "selftext": "**TLDR:** Donate to St. Jude for extra luck!\n\nHello WSB,\n\nI want to run through a trade I made for anyone who is confused about the finer points of options trading and the mechanics of an infinite squeeze like the one we saw in TSLA, PLTR, etc. \n\nI encourage anyone who has questions on options to ask in the comments. I see a lot of posts asking about the basics and I want to pay forward all the help I received on reddit.\n\nPart 1: Sell Puts\n\nI sold a Put at $30 strike price expiring in 1/15/2020. I got $1680 premium, which I used to fund the rest of my trade. Some may ask why I used this method instead of just using $3000 to buy calls? The answer is that this is to mitigate risk. If GME goes up but does not hit $30 by 1/15/2020, then some of my loses will be mitigated by the increase in the share price. \n\nPart 2: Buy Calls\n\nThe next step was to buy 25 GME call options at $30 1/15/2020. This cost $1500, which I sourced from selling my put above. This means I control 2,500 shares of GME above the $30 price point. \n\nPart 3: Forced Buying\n\nMarket Makers hedge the options they sell by buying 20% of the shares they have shorted in case the option ends in the money. This means that the MM who sold me those calls bought 500 shares of GME at $13.80 each. I removed $6,500 of shares from the market while only putting $1,500 on the line. As Gama changes, so will the number of shares the MMs are forced to buy as a hedge. \n\nPart 4: The Short Squeeze to Infinity\n\nGME already has 140% of their shares shorted. If MMs must buy shares and hold them until 1/15/2020, that makes it even more difficult for the shorts to cover. Short squeezes are violent and lead to huge increases in price. Overstock grew over 500% and VW briefly became the most valuable company due to similar strategies (Porsche literally bought tons of call options). \n\nIt is not impossible to see GME hit $100/share and maybe even $1,000/share (dream with me) since there is no precedent for a company that has this much short interest. If this occurs, then anyone who put 3K down on this trade would cash out with $2.5 Million.\n\nRisk Mitigation\n\nIf we get a squeeze: If GME goes over $30, I will make mad money. Many retail investors will become millionaire off of GME.\n\nIf GME Stagnates: My cost basis for GME is $4.10 on 1,000 shares. Even if my calls expire worthless, that will only add $1.36/share to my cost basis. As long as we stay over $5.46, I will profit on my position. I plan to sell a few weekly CC to bring my cost basis back down to $4. I have 6 weeks to make back $1500 which means I probably only need to pledge 400 shares at .2 Delta. \n\nIf GME Crashes: Even if we crash 50%, I will be making money on the trade. I will sell CCs until my cost basis is $0.\n\nPositions: GME short squeeze to infinity and beyond",

        "selftext": "Reading through some of the posts I can see how a lot of newbies have FOMO (fear of missing out). Post after post of losers making huge returns. Everyone is getting rich but you. Boofuckinghoo. The smart investor realizes it\u2019s all hype. Some of it works, most of it doesn\u2019t. To be successful you need to be able to recognize the difference and to do that, you need time, knowledge and practice. \n\nHere are ten tips that can help you along the way. \n\n**Tip 1 - You don\u2019t know shit**\n\nYou\u2019re going to lose your money. Don\u2019t get suckered by reading posts about guys who made 1000% return in 5 minutes. For every one guy that posts his massive gains, 100+ suckers have lost their money. The first lesson to realize is that it\u2019s way easier to lose money in the market than to make money. \n\n**Tip 2 - Understand how money flows in the market**\n\nMoney moves from the idiots to the knowledgable, from the impatient to the patient. Any dummy can make money short term. But to make money long-term and truly grow a portfolio, you have to be armed with knowledge and a shit ton of patience. \n\n**Tip 3 - Play for the long term**\n\nThe most important rule you need to follow religiously is NEVER FUCKING LOSE MONEY. Print it big, tape it to your wall. Your top responsibility is protecting your capital. YOLO is a stupid play. 99% of you are going to bet at the wrong time with the wrong stock. Calm the fuck down and work on a long term strategy. You have decades dummy. \n\n**Tip 4 - Time is on your side, but not much else**\n\nThe market never stops. The machine just churns and churns. Rich to poor, poor to rich, it just keeps on turning and turning. There are ALWAYS opportunities. Another IPO. Another MEME turd. FOMO is for fools. Miss a run? Big fucking deal. There\u2019s another one around the corner. You have plenty of time to learn, test, and grow your capital. \n\n**Tip 5 - Paper Trading**\n\nPaper trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with real active data but it\u2019s all practice. No real money exchanges. It\u2019s a great way to learn, to see how shitty you\u2019re going to do without losing a penny. DO THIS FOR TWO YEARS. Take whatever capital you have right now and buy some long term ETFs or solid ass stocks with minimal risk. Keep adding to it EVERY paycheck. Build up some capital for when you\u2019re ready to trade for real. Take two years to learn how to trade, watch your paper portfolio go to zero a couple dozen times, read and follow the news, WSB, Stocktwits, etc. Ask questions, test out your strategies. You\u2019ll thank me two years from now. \n\n**Tip 6 - Understand taxes**\n\nBig difference between short term and long term capital gains. Uncle Sam loves you short timers. Paying taxes is for suckers. \n\n**Tip 7 - No one knows shit**\n\nThere is no crystal ball, no one has the \u201cinside track\u201d, and only believe 10% of what you read. Be very fucking skeptical. About everything. Social media, analysts, CEOs, news, all if it, be fucking skeptical. It\u2019s all manipulation. Don\u2019t even trust Buffett. You are the guardian of your capital. Everyone wants to take it it away from you. Understand that and you won\u2019t get suckered so easily. \n\n**Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations**\n\nAs much as the market today feels like a casino, the underlying foundation of the market is investing, not gambling. With every stock you buy you\u2019re buying a piece of a business. Learn to read fundamentals. Do they make money? Are they growing? Do they have debt? How are their competitors valued? Do they make more money today than they did 5 years ago? How will they make more? How do they return capital to shareholders? And on and on and on. Learn motherfuckers. Earnings per share. P/E rations. Intrinsic value. Net income. Figure out formulas for valuing stocks. Is TSLA worth over 250x earnings? Is WFC undervalued at 13x earnings? Investing blindly because big\\_dick\\_loser said so in a post is beyond idiotic. Just burn your money, you\u2019ll have more fun. \n\n**Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for suckers**\n\nRemove the bookmark for Ferrari. You ain\u2019t getting one anytime soon. Play fucking smart. Go long. Think in decades, not days. You\u2019re not smart enough to day trade and beat the system. Not long-term anyways. Most of you won\u2019t beat the market over 10 years. So be fucking smart. Paper trade until you can consistently prove gains month after month. When you\u2019re ready to trade for real, dip in slowly. Fuck FOMO. Fuck YOLO. Remember, time is on your side. Compound that shit. \n\n**Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication**\n\nLike anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it. Easy money never lasts. Dig in, learn, practice, rinse and repeat. Be motivated to learn how to invest, take the time to study, read, test and constantly improve. Be disciplined with your money. It\u2019s fucking hard to make, easy to lose. Protect that shit. \n\n\\--\n\nFor those of you this resonates with, you\u2019ll be fine long term. Do the fucking work. For those of you who love chasing the fantasy, good luck, I mean it. It\u2019s a tough fucking pill to swallow watching your account get dwindled down to zero. Nothing tastes worse that losing all your money. \n\nPeace.",

        "selftext": "All is in the title. It was 95% of my savings. Now I come here not to lament or anything, I have to deal with that shit on my own. My friends and wife (as of now...) have my trading account frozen anyway.\n\nI come here to remind that losing can have consequences and what got me is the infamous but very real \"I'm going to recoup my losses\". At first I lost on long plays, shares, i kid you not in March i sold fsly and net at respectively 24 and 18$, approx 160k down to 120 (I bought Fastly at 32 last year).\n\nThen I discovered options and bought monthly ATM 550c from TSLA and it visited the 400 pretty quick at that time. This got me another 40k deeper. I know today it's close to 3000 (600 post split)...\n\nI did some good lucky moves and mostly made it all back in the summer, but they i decided for whatever reason to bet on Intel because there was a a series of good chip manufacturer earnings... They did -20% the fuckers and that's when things started getting fun. I got margin called so I wired intraday more funds, they were immediately available and in my panic I discovered 0DTE.\n\n0DTE was the beginning of the downward spiral that transformed a 160k loss into a 410k loss, week after week, by chunks of 25k i kept wiring to reload my day trading limit. This is basically when you MUST find the strength to stop. I kept dreaming about more multipliers \"I can do x3, x5 or x10 with a good 1pm qqq buy that will end up with a hulk dildo by 4pm\". This my friends is typically the exact reason your brain will defeat all your rules, your checks and you might even start lying just because you think its possible to make it back.\n\nI've lost everything, I don't own any property, my parents are poor and not from the US, I'm actually homeless right now but I have a good paying job in a Bay Area company. The morale of the story is that it's all fun and games if you play and stick to a small % of your saving and ABSOLUTELY don't refund your account if you take losses, denial is a stronger force than you think, and addiction to day trades is very real. Anyhow, I will carry over my big loss for years while my wife is going to use my savings and buy regular SPY so we can at least offset the possible gains in 10-15 yrs...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't be the next me.",

        "selftext": "Earlier this year, Apple announced a new policy for their IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) which is basically your unique identifier so ad companies can impact you with ads. \n\nNow, instead of being shared by default, ad companies will need apps to implement permission requests that will ask the following question: \n\n\u201cExample App would like to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. \nButton 1-&gt; Allow Tracking\nButton 2-&gt;Ask App Not to Track\u201d\n(Sorry, I didn\u2019t manage to post a screenshot)\n\nEarly testing by different companies showed that Allow Tracking gets between 0% and 20% conversion rate. \n\nSo what happens with the rest of users? They don\u2019t share their identifier, and that is a massive deal. Ad companies (like Facebook) are completely blind and can\u2019t offer personalized ads based on behavior and can\u2019t attribute installs (meaning, Facebook doesn\u2019t know if it has provided you with an installation, so how is it going to charge you for the ad?). \n\nThe full scope of the implications excedes my knowledge (and I know a thing or two about this topic), but a whole bunch of technology, revenue models, advertising strategies and a long and unknown etcetera is going to be effectively useless for 58% of the US market in 2021. \n\nLearned a lot from this sub, so I thought it was fair to give you guys this clue.

        "selftext": "The largest public pension in the U.S. by assets increased its bets on makers of electric vehicles, and a videoconferencing stock in the third quarter.\n\nCalifornia Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, or Calpers, raised investments in Nikola \ufffc (NKLA) and NIO \ufffc (NIO) in the period, and nearly doubled an investment in Zoom Video Communications \ufffc (ZM). It also edged up an investment in Tesla \ufffc (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.\n\nCalpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.\n\nA short seller\u2019s report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers\u2019 deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.\n\nNIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&amp;P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.\n\nJ.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company\u2019s deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.\n\nCalpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.\n\nThe pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.\n\nZoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe advent of Zoom and videoconferencing has left televisions behind, we have noted. The company announced in October that it will begin collecting communications taxes in certain states. Zoom stock slipped last week on a sign that a coronavirus vaccine could be available soon.\n\nCalpers bought 38,373 additional Tesla shares in the third quarter to edge up its holdings to 1.69 million shares.\n\nTesla stock has rocketed nearly 400% this year through Friday\u2019s close, including a 4.8% slip since the end of September.\n\nThe electric-vehicle giant\u2019s earnings have been strong. There has been speculation Tesla stock could join the S&amp;P 500. Recently a prominent investor blamed a mania for Tesla stock for hurting his short position in the shares.\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nIt is good to see pension fund still buying tesla. This is bullish to all the tesla shareholders.\n\nThanks for the awards.",

        "selftext": "Listen up, retards, half of y'all laughed me out the room the [last time I posted DD about Palantir](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j2u1cs/why_palantir_is_not_a_dud/), well fuck all y'all haters because I'm back with more:\n\n**TL;DR - PLTR 150 12/31/21**\n\n--------------\n\nNow let's get started:\n\nSo, Palantir is up 105% from its average low of about 9 bucks. For the autists who bought in at the low, congrats and fuck you. For the retards who fomo'd in yesterday at ATH - I still love you, but [711k? That's ballsy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jw7zed/i_heard_were_doing_pltr_now_my_whole_account_aka/).\n\nNow I'm sure you're wondering: where the fuck is PLTR's ceiling? \n\n#PLTR's advantages, now with some data\n\nI'll admit, most of my previous DD was equal parts BS and equal parts cocaine fueled shitposting that had a semblance of logic and formatting. But this time, I have **facts** in addition to my cocaine fueled shitposting. \n\nRealistically, Palantir's biggest advantage is that it helps large companies streamline their own disparate datasets without needing the companies do anything *to* that data. \n\n**This means:** Palantir clients don't have to change the way they operate to gain additional insights.\n\nEssentially, a client would use Palantir's suite of tools like Gotham to parse through all of their data so that they can make better use of said data. This part from [their IR report](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx) gets quoted a lot, but it's worth looking at:\n\n&gt; An oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and **generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks** of starting to use our platform.\n&gt;\n&gt; The energy company **identified an additional $315 million in cost savings opportunities** using our software, and the company\u2019s management is currently **targeting $1 billion in total savings** in the coming year through the use of our platform. \n\nAgain, keep in mind that all of this is happening without the client changing their data - i.e. no need to hire a dedicated team to handle data migration (along with all the risks associated with that), and no need to train their existing team to learn a new method for data entry.\n\nEssentially: with minimal disruption to operations, this client is suddenly able to identify pathways for savings by using Palantir. \n\nThe best part? \n\nThis client can't *leave* Palantir because Palantir didn't *change* anything on the client's end. All Palantir did was give the client a tool that connects some dots between dataset A and dataset B that were previously unconnected. \n\nGet rid of Palantir, and that connection is lost: this is because dataset A and dataset B used to never talk to each other, and they'll probably still never talk to each other. All Palantir did was help the *humans* behind the wheel see the connection.\n\nThis means Palantir's non-government contracts are likely to be very sticky. Moreover, in instances of mergers and acquisitions, the marrying of data is usually a huge headache. If that headache can be reduced, then it smooths out potential friction in operations and allows new acquisitions to more quickly start performing and generating ROI for their new parent company.\n\n--------------\n\n#Palantir's Future\n\nPalantir has a very bright future ahead of it for the following reasons:\n\n- Large total addressable market\n- Clean balance sheet\n- Closer integration with the military\n\nPalantir's total addressable market is estimated at 119 billion dollars. For you retards who don't know what TAM means, I'll spell it out for you:\n\n&gt; Total Addressable Market is a term that is typically used to reference the revenue opportunity available for a product or service. \n\nBut keep in mind that just because TAM is high doesn't necessarily mean that will all translate into income. As competitors emerge, they will eat into that market. But until a competitor can find the 21st century Osama bin-Laden, or help the US military fight an informationized war (more on that later), I don't think they'll be able to hold a candle to Palantir's capabilities. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point: Palantir's balance sheet is sexy as fuck.\n\nDuring their most recent earning call, they revised their revenue guidance upward to 1.07 to 1.072 *billion* in 2020. Let that number sink in. This is a 2500-person company bringing in over a BILLION dollars per year in revenue in what will most likely be incredibly *sticky* revenue. \n\nBut retard, I can hear you say, you didn't see how much they lost. \n\nI did, you asshole. And I'm getting to it: \n\nPalantir's main losses came from employee stock compensation. Namely:\n\n&gt; The company reported a third-quarter net loss of $853.3 million, or 94 cents a share, compared with a loss of $144.1 million, or 24 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Its adjusted loss was $73 million, adjusted for $847 million in stock-based compensation. \n\nPersonally, I don't see this as a loss, because retaining strong human talents in this space will be crucial for Palantir's continued dominance in this particular space. The stock-based compensation accounts for 99.26% of its entire third quarter net loss. \n\nAgain, let that shit sink in. \n\nMeanwhile, Palantir *grew* its revenue: \n\n&gt; Palantir brought in revenue of $289 million, a 52% increase from revenue of $191 million in the third quarter last year.\n\nSo long as Palantir can keep its stock-based compensation at a steady value--and I have no reason to believe that they won't--then, their continued increase in revenue will eventually outpace any such loss in the future. \n\nBut most importantly, they have 1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30th. Sitting on a pile of cash gives them operational flexibility and can help pad any unexpected issues that might arise. \n\nWhich brings us to the final big point:\n\n--------------\n\n#Palantir and the Military\n\n[I'll just link the Q3 earnings presentation for you](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf) because it's got pretty pictures that you retards love. But here are the main points:\n\n- Palantir software is becoming the de facto operating system of US and Allied Defense\n- 2-year, $91M contract with US army research lab for AI and ML development\n- Enabling Mission Command for NORAD &amp; USNORTHCOM Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (N/NC JADC2)\n\n**Palantir software is becoming the de facto operating system of US and Allied Defense**\n\nWe're moving towards an era of even greater integration and interoperability in the military--not just between different branches but between different nation's militaries as well. One of the key factors that allowed the Allies to kick the shit out of Nazi Germany was a unified command structure. \n\nPalantir is building just that for the US and her allies. \n\nThink of how inefficient the military is, especially a military alliance that spans multiple nations, multiple languages, and multiple different command structures. \n\nThink of how *dumb* your average crayon-eating grunt is. You think Lance Corporal Fuckface is going to learn French or German or Polish so he can coordinate effectively with his counterpart in NATO and call in an airstrike? Or you think he'll just go through a simplified process of calling it in to the US chain of command, and that data gets relayed via Palantir's services to the appropriate French jet on station to deliver some ordnance? \n\n**US Army Research Lab Implication**\n\n[This is the kind of shit](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-can-help-hunt-down-missile-sites-in-china/) that the US army uses AI and ML for:\n\n- Identifying Chinese and Russian airbases, missile sites, and radars\n- Significantly cut down on the amount of time a human has to sift through satellite images\n\nThis forms the informational logistical backbone in the era of informational warfare. Here is the example image from the slideshow where Palantir is used to [identify an airbase in the Russian Far East](https://i.imgur.com/X2irHFV.png), identifying crucial equipment and logistical nodes that can be prioritized in a war. \n\n**N/NC JADC2 Implications**\n\nPalantir outright states that they're using AI to help provide course of action development to NORAD. It means we're one step closer to Skynet, baby! But more importantly, Palantir placed what looks to be an image of a [SIGINT/ELINT op](https://i.imgur.com/tiqwNu6.png) off the coast of Kamchatka. \n\nBut that's not what you should focus on. You should focus on the fact that Palantir is now a crucial part of mission command in NORAD operations. Y'all remember Desert Storm? How the US Air Force basically clowned on Saddam's army for a month straight? That shit didn't emerge in a vacuum. It took 9 months of non-stop mission planning and 24/7 command and control during the op. \n\nPalantir's mission is to make the planning and command process of a similar op in the future *far more streamlined*. And given that China has more or less set a deadline for the reunification of Taiwan in 2049, the US needs to gear up for a major war in the Pacific while keeping an eye on Russia to make sure they don't try and rebuild the Soviet Union. \n\nAnd guess who will be passing all those delicious bits of data back and forth that entire time? \n\nPalantir.\n\n--------\n\nEDIT: All you assholes telling me I jinxed it, consider this your chance to buy shares on the cheap. \n\nAll you retards buying FD's, just switch to ITM LEAPs.",

I have 10% of my liquid portfolio invested it.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is nearing record highs after more than doubling this year, partly driven by fears that major central bank easing and fiscal stimulus will debase currencies. The digital asset [advanced](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/bitcoin-tops-17-000-for-first-time-since-december-2017) for a third session Wednesday, outperforming most of its rivals to break above $18,000. Its performance has attracted some big Wall Street money managers including Fidelity Investments, which launched a Bitcoin fund over the summer, and macro investor [Paul Tudor Jones](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1704916).\n\nIn a series of tweets Tuesday, hedge fund founder [Ray Dalio](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1801626) questioned the cryptocurrency\u2019s utility as a storehold of wealth, but [added](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/ray-dalio-says-he-might-be-missing-something-about-bitcoin): \u201cI might be missing something about Bitcoin, so I\u2019d love to be corrected.\u201d\n\nOther wealthy Bitcoin backers include Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins who are [now](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-06/winklevoss-twins-ride-bitcoin-surge-to-become-billionaires-again) worth about $1 billion each from the cryptocurrency\u2019s surge, according to Bloomberg\u2019s wealth index.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s gains have helped make up for Salinas\u2019s business interests. Shares in his biggest listed asset -- conglomerate [Grupo Elektra SAB](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ELEKTRA%2A:MM) \\-- have slumped more than 10% this year, while those in the local [television network](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AZTECACP:MM) he and his family control have dropped almost 60%.\n\nA spokesman for Salinas didn\u2019t immediately reply to an email and phone call seeking comment.\n\nSalinas, 65, who contracted Covid-19 last month, [said](https://twitter.com/RicardoBSalinas/status/1328895703486255104) in a later tweet he first invested in Bitcoin four years ago, adding he holds the balance of his liquid portfolio in precious metals miners. Salinas and his family have earned more than $500 million through dividends from their listed holdings in the past two decades, according to the Bloomberg\u2019s wealth index.\n\nSalinas has also used Twitter to comment on the pandemic. He previously called for Mexico\u2019s health officials to stop imposing \u201c[authoritarian](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-15/mexican-billionaire-says-health-officials-are-wrecking-economy)\u201d policies to contain the spread of virus and took to the site again to reveal his own diagnosis.\n\n\u201cTake care of yourselves and do not be afraid,\u201d he [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/mexican-billionaire-with-covid-says-we-ll-all-get-it-eventually) last month. \u201cWe\u2019ll all have to get it, and we will be fine.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Gather round my fellow gamblers and shit posters, I have a story and a proposition for you all.\n\nSeveral weeks ago **I had the bright idea to YOLO my entire account in Palantir**. \n\nWhen PLTR was down and out, myself and a few otherwise guys were balls to the wall in long positions. We all loved the company, but quite frankly, things were looking pretty bleak. While we knew the company should be worth more than the measly $9 it was at, the market price told us otherwise.\n\nI was rather worried about what I had done. YOLOing my entire account into Palantir on IPO day drove me to post **a sad story about I had fucked up thousands and thousands of dollars of gains**, which I later deleted out of embarrassment. You can find the remnants of that story here:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3xaua/once\\_upon\\_a\\_time\\_in\\_2020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3xaua/once_upon_a_time_in_2020/)\n\nThe only thing that remains is some top comments of people calling me a retarded degenerate.\n\nI held on to my sweet sweet palantir, and as any good redditor would, I continued preaching the gospel of Thiel and Karp in any case.\n\nin one WSB conversation, I was lamenting about how I needed money from Palantir in order to pay for the PS5 I had already pre-ordered. This was a very serious concern, because I had paid Walmart, and subsequently saw my Palantir position lose several thousand dollars. Wasn't quite sure how I would explain this one to the Mrs.\n\nA classic millennial problem indeed.\n\nThen along came a random internet stranger named u/ZanderPerk. He promised me that he **would buy me a PS5 if PLTR hit $20 by end of the year**, which at the time, seemed like an outlandish price. You can find that comment here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj8apo/last\\_chance\\_for\\_early\\_bird\\_pricing\\_pltr/gagx94u/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj8apo/last_chance_for_early_bird_pricing_pltr/gagx94u/?context=3)\n\nA few weeks later, our sweet sweet hivemind started heating up, and I reminded the internet of what was promised:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jpbtx9/pltr\\_looking\\_forward\\_to\\_my\\_free\\_ps5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jpbtx9/pltr_looking_forward_to_my_free_ps5/)\n\nZanderperk, being the gentleman that he is, assured me that **he would live up to his end of the bargain**: [https://i.imgur.com/8lM0j4D.png](https://i.imgur.com/8lM0j4D.png)\n\nSo in anticipation of this glorious transaction, I did what anyone in my position would, and ordered a custom bumper sticker in Zander's honour: [https://i.imgur.com/4d2yhA2.png](https://i.imgur.com/4d2yhA2.png)\n\nThis baby will be slapped right on top the console, and forever live beside my 55 inch 4k TV.\n\nNow it seems that reddit has caught wind of this tale, and people are calling on Zander to send me the money. I have asked him for his email address so that I can send him a PayPal money request, to the tune of $499 USD. You can see further discussion here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzjzlg/pltr\\_just\\_won\\_this\\_man\\_a\\_playstation\\_5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzjzlg/pltr_just_won_this_man_a_playstation_5/)\n\n# Now here is my promise to pay it forward.\n\n# Since PLTR has indeed hit $20 before the end of the year, I will do the exact same thing for someone else *IF* Zander pays up AND it hits $30 before the end of the year.\n\nIf Zander sends me the money, I will post pictures of the PS5 and sticker in WSB for you all to see, and I will update this post with a link to that post. (The sticker doesn't arrive until \\~Dec 7th.)\n\n***Then*** if PLTR crosses $30.00 before the end of Dec 31 2021, I will set up a quick lottery system to give out another PS5 using some clever technology that will be determined at a later date. (I already have an idea in mind.)\n\nIn order to enter the draw, people must be able to prove that they are still in an active stock holding or long option position. The position must be started or purchased before the end of the day tomorrow (November 24th). Bears can fuck off.\n\nThe winner will be ordered a PS5 disc edition off of Amazon, Walmart or Bestbuy straight to an address of their choice. Winner must reside in a country that receives deliveries from one of these stores.\n\n*CHECK BACK HERE FOR UPDATES.*",

        "selftext": "WOW, today is going to be quite a day by the looks of it!!\n\n* * *\n\nU.S pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German biotech firm BioNTech said their coronavirus vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 among those without evidence of prior infection, according to data published Monday from their late-stage vaccine trial.\n\nIt comes as drugmakers and research centers around the world scramble to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in an attempt to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 1.25 million lives worldwide.\n\nScientists are hoping for a coronavirus vaccine that is at least 75% effective, while White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has previously said one that is 50% or 60% effective would be acceptable.\n\nAlbert Bourla, chairman and CEO of Pfizer, hailed the development as a \u201cgreat day for science and humanity.\u201d\n\nThe results were based on the first interim efficacy analysis conducted by an external and independent Data Monitoring Committee from the phase three clinical study. The independent group of experts oversee U.S. clinical trials to ensure the safety of participants.\n\nThe analysis evaluated 94 confirmed Covid-19 infections among the trial\u2019s 43,538 participants. Pfizer and BioNTech said the case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received a placebo indicated a vaccine efficacy rate of above 90% at seven days after the second dose.\n\nIt means that protection from Covid-19 is achieved 28 days after the initial vaccination, which consists of a two-dose schedule.\n\nThe final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary, however, as safety and additional data continues to be collected.\n\n\u201cThe first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine\u2019s ability to prevent COVID-19,\u201d Pfizer\u2019s Bourla said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen,\u201d Bourla continued.\n\n\u201cWith today\u2019s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis. We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nRoughly 42% of the trial\u2019s participants had diverse backgrounds, Pfizer and BioNTech said, adding that there haven\u2019t been any serious safety concerns reported yet.\n\nThe companies said they planned to submit for emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration soon after they have two months of data, which is currently on track for the third week of November.\n\nBased on current projections, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.\n\nThe companies said they plan to submit data from the full phase three trial, which began on July 27, for scientific peer-review publication.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/covid-vaccine-pfizer-drug-is-more-than-90percent-effective-in-preventing-infection.html",

        "selftext": "Gooood morning!\n\nI hope you are all enjoying this wonderfully green day.\n\nAfter PLTR reached $20 yesterday u/ZanderPerk \\- a stranger from this subreddit - gave me $400 USD to cover the costs of my PS5. I already have the console in hand, and there is a custom bumper sticker coming in his honour. You can read the full story here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzrj3y/legend\\_of\\_the\\_wsb\\_ps5\\_i\\_promise\\_to\\_pay\\_pltr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzrj3y/legend_of_the_wsb_ps5_i_promise_to_pay_pltr/)\n\nAs promised, I will be paying it forward and giving some other lucky Palantir bull a Digital Edition PS5 if PLTR\u2019s stock price reaches $30.00 this year. Here is how it will work.\n\nThe day Palantir touches 30.00 (before the end of 2020) I will come back to WSB and post a form for you to enter the draw. \n\nAnd it gets better.\n\nIt must be the season of giving, because another generous redditor - u/degenerate-hotdog has reached out to me and offered to cover the costs of TWO other PlayStation 5\u2019s.\n\nThat\u2019s right. There are **THREE** **PLAYSTATION 5**\u2019s being given away if Palantir hits $30 this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# FAQ:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How do I enter?**\n\nWhen Palantir hits $30, I will post a form on this subreddit for you to complete to enter the draw. Messages sent to me and comments in this or other threads do not count as entering the draw. The winner will be selected directly from the survey results. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What information will be required to enter?**\n\nThe form will only ask for your 1) reddit username, 2) an email address and 3) your selection of a number between 1 and 1,000,000. Do not give anyone any other information who may be posing as someone who is part of this draw. I will be doing the draw, and those are the only 3 details I will be asking for. &lt;- This part is important. Don\u2019t get scammed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How can I find the post to enter?**\n\nThere are three ways to ensure you don\u2019t miss the post. You can follow me on reddit and get notifications about when I post. Also, when Palantir reaches $30, the post will be titled \u201c$PLTR - WSB PLAYSTATION 5 DRAW\u201d. I will also update THIS post with a link to the draw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What exact price action will trigger the draw?**\n\nIf Palantir touches $30.00 USD before the end of 2020 the draw will occur. That means that even if it touches and then retreats, the draw will still occur.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How will the draw be done?**\n\nThere will be a 48 hour window from when the post is created to enter. I will post the exact draw closing time in the post. When entry closes, I will remove the link to the entry form from the post. After all entries have been collected, I am going to log into World of Warcraft, on a character aptly named Palantir. I will then use the World of Warcraft loot rolling system to roll for a random number between 1 and 1,000,000. This rolling system is entirely random. I will \u201c/roll 1000000\u201d ONCE and then I will check that number against a spreadsheet of all the entries. Whoever is closest will win. The entire WoW draw and spreadsheet lookup process will be recorded and I will post it on YouTube. Winners will be announced on the draw post, along with the recording of the draw process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How many winners will there be?**\n\nThere will be 3 winners. The closest 3 numbers will be given a console. However, I only personally guarantee the console for the first closest number. The second and third consoles are u/degenerate-hotdog\u2019s responsibility. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How will winners be contacted?**\n\nWinners will be contacted via email and reddit private message, using the addresses and usernames collected via the form.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What if they don\u2019t respond?**\n\nYou will have 7 days to respond before I move on to the next winner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What if** u/degenerate-hotdog **changes his mind?**\n\nThat\u2019s unfortunate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What if there is a tie?**\n\nIn the event that two numbers are the same distance from the drawn number and there is a tie, whoever can prove to me that they were bullish on Palantir first wins. A bullish reddit post about why you like the company will suffice, as there are no financial requirements for this draw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How will the winner get their PS5?**\n\nThe PS5 that I am giving away will be ordered from Amazon, Walmart, Bestbuy or Gamestop straight to an address of your choosing. If you don\u2019t want to reveal your personal address, we can send it to a post office box or your place of work. Alternatively, we can try to set up in-store pick up.\n\nWith regards to u/degenerate-hotdog, he has told me that he wants to do GameStop gift cards instead. In any case, I will do my best to put the second and third place winners in touch with him, and how you get your prize from him is between the two of you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What if we can\u2019t get one because they are all sold out?**\n\nWe will try to get one for a couple of weeks. If we are struggling to get one, I will send you an appropriate gift card valued at $400 USD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What if some unforeseen challenge prevents us from getting a PS5 sent to me?**\n\nI will send you a gift card, intended to be used on a PS5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Will you buy a more expensive one from a scalper?**\n\nNegative. Regular price from a reputable retailer only.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Who qualifies?**\n\nIn order to qualify you must be over the age of 18, a member of this subreddit and you must be bullish on Palantir. You do not have to own a security or option relating to Palantir, but bulls are encouraged to participate. I am not sure that I can legally provide kickbacks to individuals, so I am choosing to just remove the position requirement to be safe. Please do not enter if you or your family members will not play the PS5. These things are in high demand. You must also reside in a country that receives shipments from Walmart, Amazon, Bestbuy and/or Gamestop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Do I have to get a PS5?**\n\nYes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Can I pay the extra to get a disc edition?**\n\nYes, but you will have to send me $100 USD plus transfer fees first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Can I get an xbox?**\n\nNo. Xbox sucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Can I get cash instead?**\n\nNo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does the winner have to do?**\n\nWinners will be asked to please post a picture of their PS5 on WSB and tag myself and u/degenerate-hotdog in it. We would also strongly encourage you to pay this forward at the next aggressive Palantir price target or resistance point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Is this legal?**\n\nThere are no laws preventing me from giving away gifts, and I am not requiring you to take any trading action to enter this draw. So yes. This is legal.",

Even then, Volkswagen  was already late-to-market with electrification and digitalization in  particular.  \n\nLate like every other car manufacturer.\n\n&gt; build the technology, especially digital technology, we need for the  Group as a whole. This will turn our cars into digital devices \n\nCars will become another platform to sell software.

That is an immense new segment, and will create a host of new opportunities. \n\nWhat car manufacturer do you think has the best Self driving software?\n\n&gt; In ten years, the most valuable company in the world will be a mobility company again.\u00a0 \n\nYes.

Collect $1.14 per share in dividends (5.45% yield) and target long term capital gain of 82% within a year (based on my price target of $38)\n\n**My positions:** Over the last few weeks I have been accumulating shares on any dips \u2013 I own 40k shares at an average price of $17.22 (currently have an unrealized capital gain of 21%). I plan on holding for more than a year to collect the juicy dividend, get favorable tax treatment, and significant capital gains based on returning to pre-COVID stock price level.\n\n**Company Background**\n\nStock Price (11/13 close): $20.88\n\nMarket Capitalization: $4.25B\n\nAnnual Dividend: $1.14 per share (5.45%)\n\nWARNING: This is a boomer stock. This is not a pre-revenue EV stock valued based on stolen graphic design renderings. This is not a SPAC pump and dump or a pre-revenue tech company. I realize this is going to be outside the wheelhouse of the short attention span of most WSB players. But I think this is also a long-term lock for big gains with little risk and these asymmetric risks are ideal for long term candidates. \n\nUnum (UNM) is a Fortune 500 insurance company based in Chattanooga, TN. They primarily sell group disability and life insurance to other companies in the US and UK. 182k businesses get insurance through UNM \u2013 including one in three Fortune 500 companies. They also offer other insurance policies like accident, critical illness, dental, and vision (and historically offered Long Term Care Insurance). \n\nBelow is a historical financial summary (numbers from SA):\n\n$ in millions | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | TTM\n:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\nRevenues | 10,731.3 | 11,046.5 | 11,286.8 | 11,598.5 | 11,998.9 | 11,923.2 \nEBITDA | 1,490.6 | 1,615.4 | 1,667.3 | 896.5 | 1,696.9 | \t1,521.1\nBasic EPS | $3.51 | $3.96 | $4.39 | $2.38 | $5.25 | $4.67\n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\n1. Strong revenue and earnings even during COVID \u2013 for the third quarter of 2020, UNM reported net income of $231.1 million ($1.13 per share), compared to net income of $242.0 million ($1.16 per share) for the third quarter of 2019. COVID had a give and take impact on the business \u2013 they collect less premiums when employment goes down but COVID also lead to lower claims in some lines of business like their dental and vision insurance as people put off care. There was elevated mortality which lead to higher claims on their life insurance business. But overall, their earnings have seen little impact from COVID while their share price has been completely hammered. \n\n2. Valuation \u2013 this stock is insanely cheap. In February 2020 (immediately pre-COVID), the stock was trading close to $30.  Current PE ratio (TTM) is 4.47. Per the third quarter results, book value per common share is now up to $53.50 (14.6 percent growth compared to the year-ago quarter). It is trading at less than 50% of book value. \n\n3. Dividend Yield \u2013 current dividend is $1.14 per share (5.45% dividend yield). The dividend has been growing for the last 12 years. The 10 year dividend CAGR is 13.22%. Current payout ratio is under 23% so the dividend is about as safe as it gets.  \n\n4. Share buy-backs \u2013 in the past, the Board has authorized massive share repurchases. In May 2019, they authorized $750m of share repurchases. In 2019, they repurchased 12.3 million shares for $400.4 million. This was suspended during COVID, but it shows an appetite for buying back shares and that management thought the company was undervalued even in May 2019 when it was trading at $36 per share. \n\n5. Technicals \u2013 the stock is currently trading near historic support areas with limited downside, significant support, and lots of room for upside.\n \n**Headwinds**\n\nInvestors have primarily criticized UNM for the increases to reserves in the closed block Long Term Care (LTC) business. I think the market is putting too much emphasis on this business \u2013 and as morbid as it sounds, COVID is actually helping the Company here. \n\nIn the past, UNM tried to make a profit on LTC insurance and failed like many other insurers. They made bad assumptions on lapse rates and longevity which has cost them a lot of money \u2013 these policies are incredibly unprofitable now that people survive a long time in assisted living facilities and nursing homes. In 2009 they closed the individual LTC business and in 2012 they closed the group business. Even though the block has been closed, they have repeatedly dumped more money to increase their reserves. Earlier this year, the Company came to an agreement with insurance regulators in Maine to add $2.1b in reserves over the next 7 years. \nHowever, COVID seems to have had a favorable impact on the closed-block business (though they won\u2019t explicitly say this on earnings calls). A lot of the COVID deaths have happened in nursing homes which have led to increased mortality and therefore lower benefit payments. You can see this in their third quarter results: \n\n&gt;As reported in the third quarter results, the Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $70.8 million in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 163.2 percent from $26.9 million in the third quarter of 2019. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business was 67.4 percent in the third quarter of 2020, compared to an interest adjusted loss ratio of 89.8 percent in the third quarter of 2019, driven primarily by higher claimant mortality.\n\nEDIT: Imgur link with position proof\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XKfi9v1",

        "selftext": "Just wanted to put my thoughts out there before markets open for what it's worth.  Full disclosure, I do own PLTR along with EV stocks outside of TSLA.  They are currently only make up less than 10% of my portfolio.\n\nThe rally that we have seen this week has been impressive.  I imagine for traders this was an incredible week and a lot of money was made.  Hats off to you guys and cheers.  I've learned that there are many ways to win on the market, and trading is certainly one of them.  I'm not one to say that it's a horrible way to approach the markets just because it doesn't work or sit well with me.  For those who are interested in TRADING, this may not apply as much to you.\n\nHowever, for those who are thinking about INVESTING.  Please tread carefully.  Ask yourself these questions\n\n1. Do you know what the company does / is hoping to achieve?\n2. How does that sit with you?  Do you agree with the company's goals? \n3. What, if anything, would change your decision?  What are factors that you believe will prevent the company from doing what it intends to do?\n4. Given that you have a sense of the company's achievements, goals, and plans for the future, are you okay with paying what it's currently worth?\n\nAt least take some time to answer some of these questions before moving forward.  Similarly come up with a plan for investing your money.  Establish how much you intend to put in the company (i.e. 300 dollars).  If you are concerned that you are buying, for example, PLTR at its all time highs and that it will dip next week, start a position 1/3th position today and come up with a plan to invest the other 2/3 over the next two weeks.  That way if it does dip, you catch some of the dip, but if it does continue to go up for two more weeks, you at least caught some of the initial price/gain.  Either way, at least, by starting a 1/3rd position you can satisfy your FOMO and adjust your plan accordingly from there.\n\nAt the end of the day, tread carefully.  Take as much emotion out of the equation as possible.  Trust me, there will always be more opportunities to make money in the markets.  Right now it's PLTR.  A few days ago it was everything EV, few months ago it was all BioTech, a few months before that it was chip stocks.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and tech companies. I put this post together to share some key takeaways I had from looking at Airbnb's S-1 filing. If you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. Thanks\n\nOn Monday November 16th, Airbnb filed to go public. While a target IPO price has not yet been set, Airbnb looks to be aiming to raise about $3 billion dollars at an analyst-estimated valuation of $3 billion. This is up from Airbnb's most recent valuation of $18.1 billion in April of this year when it raised a total of $2 billion in debt to cope with the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nAirbnb is a remarkable company. What started in 2007 as 2 friends renting out airbeds in their apartment to attendees of a conference has, 13 years later, grown into a company operating in 220 countries with over 4 million hosts who have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. In 2019, there were 327 million nights and experiences booked on Airbnb. Nobody could have predicted those numbers in 2007. Airbnb has defined a brand new travel category and become a standard part of our vocabulary, much like Zoom. As they state in their S-1:\n\n&gt;*\" \u201cAirbnb\u201d has become synonymous with one-of-a-kind travel on a global scale.\"*\n\nBut, while Airbnb is clearly a remarkable company, is it a good investment? That\u2019s the question that this post aims to answer. Here are some key takeaways from an analysis of Airbnb\u2019s recent S-1 filing:\n\n(\\****Note:*** *In case you\u2019re wondering, an S-1 is the document that a companies files with the SEC when they plan to go public)*\n\n1. Airbnb is a resilient business\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on Airbnb\u2019s business. Gross booking value (GBV) in March was down 127%. Due to cancellations and alterations, Airbnb actually lost money on bookings in March. However by August, GBV was only down 14% when compared to August 2019. This impressive recovery shows how strong Airbnb\u2019s business is.\n\nFor the 9 months ending September 2020, Airbnb posted a revenue drop of 32% when compared with the first 9 months of 2019. While this is a concern, the cut to sales and marketing expenditure at the same time points to a business that is quite resilient - In the same time period that revenue dropped by 32%, Airbnb cut its sales and marketing spend by a massive 54%. The ability to cut sales and marketing spend by over half while only having a revenue drop of 32% (in the middle of a pandemic) points to a business that is highly resilient with strong brand and customer loyalty.\n\n2. Post-Covid travel patterns may benefit Airbnb\n\nIf we compare the gross nights and experiences booked on Airbnb to Airbnb\u2019s gross booking value (GBV), we see an interesting pattern. Gross bookings in August are down 28% YoY while GBV is only down 14%. This means that the average spend on an individual booking has actually trended up this year! To further validate this point, long-term stays were down only 13% this year, compared to 81% for short-term stays. There was actually YoY growth for long-term stays from May to September. The importance of long-term stays is highlighted by the quote below:\n\n&gt;*\u201cWe believe the long-term stays category represents a different use case than leisure travel, and as a result, was not as impacted as dramatically by\u00a0COVID-19.\u201d*\n\nLong-term stays are a distinct competitive advantage for Airbnb and if trends continue they could drive a lot of long-term growth.\n\nAirbnb has also highlighted a number of other categories that have performed particularly well this year. In particular, \u2018domestic travel\u2019, \u2018short-distance travel\u2019 and \u2018travel outside top 20 cities\u2019 have performed very well. For example, short-distance travel grew a whopping 38% YoY in September.\n\nNo doubt these trends will reverse somewhat as we exit the pandemic. However, it is unlikely they will reverse fully. If these trends maintain decent momentum, they represent a shift in travel patterns that uniquely benefits Airbnb and provides a significant competitive advantage.\n\n3. Strong customer retention and brand loyalty\n\nOne of the most striking figures from the S-1 is that 91% of Airbnb\u2019s traffic is organic, coming from direct and unpaid channels. This is very impressive. Airbnb has built an incredible brand and clearly has strong brand loyalty.\n\n&gt;*\u201cOur strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019.\u201d*\n\nCustomer engagement and retention are also impressively high on the platform. In 2019, 68% of guests left a review of their stay. 69% of revenue generate in 2019 was from repeat guests.\n\nAirbnb also has very strong retention among their host community. In 2019, 84% of revenue came from people who had hosted in 2018. This shows that the majority of hosts are staying on the platform and continuing to earn money through Airbnb.\n\n4. International expansion is a big opportunity\n\nAirbnb\u2019s revenue growth has slowed over the last three years. It grew by 32% in 2019, down from 43% in 2018. While slowed growth is never great, 32% is quite healthy.\n\nIt remains to be seen what the impacts of Covid-19 will be on growth over the next few years. However, there seem to be big opportunities for international expansion which would allow Airbnb to maintain (and possibly improve) its growth rate.\n\nAirbnb believes that its total addressable market is a whopping $3.4 trillion. While you can always take these predictions with a grain of salt, it is clear that Airbnb believes that a big part of this market opportunity lies outside the US and Europe. They highlight international expansion as a key part of their long-term growth strategy:\n\n&gt;\\*\u201c\\****Expand our global network.*** *We plan to expand our global network in the countries in which we already have a deep presence, as well as to expand into markets where our penetration is lower, such as India, China, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and tens of thousands of smaller markets and remote areas around the world.\u201d*\n\nThere are some encouraging signs that Airbnb has the potential to grow their international markets. They operate in 220 countries and importantly, 86% of their hosts are outside the US. International markets have also seen an increase in GBV and average nights per booking. In fact, Latin America has the highest average nights per booking of any region, at 4.1 nights. (North America is 3.7)\n\nThe strong customer loyalty previously mentioned, significant host presence in international markets (86%) and changing consumption patterns towards longer stays means that Airbnb has the potential to unlock a lot of value as they focus on international markets.\n\n5. Regulation is a big concern\n\nRegulation is a big risk for Airbnb. 70% of the company\u2019s top 200 largest cities (by revenue) have implemented some form of regulation on short-term stays. For example, London has put a 90 nights per year limit on short term stays for properties without specific planning permission to do so.\n\nAirbnb make it clear in the S-1 that the evolving regulatory situation is a cause for concern:\n\n&gt;*\u201cWe are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\u201d*\n\nAirbnb makes sure to point out that they are not dependant on any one city, region or country. For example, the US is the only country that represents over 10% of Airbnb\u2019s revenue. While this may be true, the evolving regulatory environment does not seem to be going in Airbnb\u2019s favour.\n\nInvestment Plan\n\n*Please note that this is just an explanation of investing decisions for my personal portfolio and not a recommendation to anyone to buy/sell any stock.*\n\nTo make a decision on whether or not to invest in Airbnb, I believe there are 3 important questions to answer:\n\n1. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?\n2. What year should conclusions be based on?\n3. What is a fair valuation?\n\n1. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?\n\nAlthough there are regulatory concerns, based on the above analysis I believe that Airbnb has strong upside potential.\n\n2. What year should conclusions be based on?\n\nThe Airbnb S-1 is primarily focused on 2019 numbers. Airbnb believes that 2019 figures are the fairest reflection of the strength of the business. They believe that 2020 is a highly irregular year and that the company will rebound quickly post-covid. Investors should come up with their own conclusion on that but I agree with Airbnb that 2019 is a fair reflection of the business.\n\n3. What is a fair valuation for Airbnb?\n\nThis is where things get tricky. In some ways, Airbnb doesn\u2019t have any direct competitors to compare against. They are similar to both OTAs (online travel agents) and hotel chains like Hilton but obviously quite different in a number of ways too.\n\nIn my opinion, an interesting comparison is with Uber. While not exactly the same, Airbnb and Uber have a lot of similarities. They are both semi-marketplaces (Airbnb is closer to a true marketplace). Uber connects drivers with riders while Airbnb connects hosts with guests. They have a similar business model in that they both take a % of each transaction on their platform.\n\nObviously there are quite a few differences. In particular, Uber drivers are far more commoditised than Airbnb hosts. Uber also has more direct competition (Lyft).\n\nLooking at 2019 figures for the fairest comparison, Uber is currently priced at roughly 6.33 times 2019 revenue. If we go with the analyst expected valuation of $30 billion, Airbnb would be valued at roughly 6 times 2019 revenue. Uber grew revenue 26% YoY in 2019 while Airbnb grew 32%.\n\nWith all of this in mind and particularly considering that Uber\u2019s model is less defensible, I believe that the analyst-estimated $30 billion valuation represents a very good price for Airbnb.\n\nWhat\u2019s my plan?\n\nMy plan is to wait and see what happens on IPO day. If analysts are wrong and the stock pops above $40/50 billion, I won\u2019t be purchasing and will wait to see what Airbnb\u2019s performance is like over the next few months. If the stock settles at or below $30 billion, then I will definitely be adding it to my portfolio.\n\nWhat\u2019s your plan?\n\nAre you considering investing in Airbnb? What did you think of my analysis above? Anything I missed? Let me know your thoughts.\n\nAnd please let me know if you found this post valuable and would like to read more. Thanks",

        "selftext": "So I've seen some posts here about people asking about when to buy stocks during this market downturn. And I've been trying to figure it out myself and I came up with some ideas that seem useful.  This is perhaps my third market downturn and I feel like I've gotten a lot better at it since the first time. \n\n1-Nobody knows beforehand where the exact bottom is beforehand. Everybody has ideas, but most of them are wrong. If you think the market is gonna bottom in a week and you're waiting for it to bottom, you'll probably miss the boat. \n\n2-Different stocks and industries bottom on different days. For example, cruises bottomed on a different day than tech stocks over the past week. Cruises bottomed on the 28th or 29th. Whereas tech stocks bottomed on the 30th and today. (this could change as the week progresses, but I'm guessing that these stocks have already bottomed for this downturn. I could be wrong though.) \n\n3-The best time to buy is going to be around the time when you're scared and kind of hesitant because you think prices might drop more. This is when prices tend to be most depressed. Not only are you feeling this way, but so is everybody else. \n\n4- Since you probably don't know how long the downturn will last and how severe it will be, I recommend a strategy of buying on different days instead of dropping all your money all at once on the first day. \n\n5- Try to buy after the downtrend reverses. Don't buy before the trend reversal. It takes some practice to be able to identify when this happens. But generally, get a good chart of your stock using thinkorswim or some other problem. Watch the price action and set up a simple moving average. The MACD indicator can also help. As the downtrend continues, the price will rally a little. Most of these rallies will be false rallies and the price will drop further after the rally. At some point, you'll see a particularly strong rally and that may be a trend reversal. You can take a chance at buying in at that point. In case you're wrong, it would be wise to set a stop loss slightly below your entry point. You can also use a trailing stop loss. At some point, one of those big rallies is gonna be the real thing. And then you'll be in.\n\n6- Don't worry if you miss the bottom. You can still get in at a good price if you're a little late or early. A lot of people miss the boat entirely or they panic sell and don't get back in. You're beating all of those people already. \n\n7. Try to buy the securities that you think will recover strongly and quickly. There's no point in buying in a market downturn if you end up with a stock that doesn't recover or takes many years to do so. (some people will disagree with me here) Or worse, a stock that falls further.\n\n8. Don't be afraid to experiment. The more market downturns you go through, the better you'll get at it. And the better you get at it, the more money you'll make. there's big money to be made in a very short amount of time in these downturns.",

        "selftext": "December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.\n\nThey're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/).

Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm\u2019s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.\n\n**Pros**: Affirm says its \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.\u00a0 As e-commerce grows, there\u2019s plenty of room for growth in the market\u2014less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers\u2019 ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.\n\n**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm\u2019s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.\n\n## Airbnb\n\nSymbol: ABNB  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  \nRevenue growth: -32%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $697 million\n\n[Airbnb\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)\n\nAs the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.\n\n**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb\u2019s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it\u2019s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.\n\n## DoorDash\n\nSymbol: DASH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  \nRevenue growth: 226%  \nGross margin: 53%  \nNet loss: $149 million\n\n[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)\n\nAfter moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash \u201cdashers\u201d deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.\n\n**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square\u2019s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.\n\n**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash\u2019s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash\u2019s business model.\n\n## Roblox\n\nSymbol: RBLX  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  \nRevenue growth: 68%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $206 million\n\n[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)\n\nMuch more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).\n\n**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans\u2019 app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.\n\n## Wish (ContextLogic)\n\nSymbol: WISH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  \nRevenue growth: 32%  \nGross margin: 65%  \nNet loss: $176 million\n\n[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)\n\nOvershadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the \u201caffordable\u201d segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.\n\n**Pros**: Shopping online isn\u2019t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish\u2019s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\n**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish\u2019s business with new rules or requirements.\n\n[Source](https://fortune.com/2020/11/25/2020-ipos-airbnb-roblox-affirm-wish-doordash-predictions-going-public/)",

The result is herding that ultimately becomes a drag on those companies\u2019 returns, according to the latest [academic research ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715077)into retail investing.\n\n When Robinhood users pile into a stock in large numbers, the average excess return on the day surges to 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month, a new paper found. \n\n \n\nThe thinking is that in seeking to make investing easier, the platform\u2019s slimmed-down interface could be resulting in concentrated trading in the most \u201cattention grabbing\u201d shares. That increases the chance of herding which can lead to big market reversals.\n\n\u201cRobinhood users are more subject to attention biases,\u201d wrote authors including behavioral finance pioneer Terrance Odean. \u201cThe combination of na\u00efve investors and the simplification of information is associated with herding episodes.\u201d\n\nRobinhood was at the center of Wall Street drama this year as the young fintech firm stirred up an investing [frenzy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-10-22/how-robinhood-s-addictive-app-made-trading-a-covid-pandemic-pastime) amplified by Covid-19 restrictions and stimulus cash.\n\nAs retail volumes spiked, even professionals started tracking the activity of Robinhood\u2019s 13 million users in a hunt for fresh trading signals. To do that they relied on data from Robintrack, a website that provided updates on retail stock demand, on which the academics also based their calculations.\n\nOne idea from the academic world: A strategy of selling a security after a herding event and buying it five days later delivers a 3.5% return and nearly double that for more extreme scenarios.\n\nIn fact, the researchers say there\u2019s good reason to think hedge funds are doing some version of this, since they observed a spike in short interest among shares bought heavily by Robinhood traders.\n\n[Read more: Robinhood Users Weren\u2019t as Reckless as Portrayed During Rally](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-29/robinhood-users-are-a-bit-less-nuts-than-you-were-led-to-believe)\n\nIt\u2019s familiar territory for two of the paper\u2019s co-authors. Odean at the University of California, Berkeley, and Brad M. Barber at the University of California, Davis have previously [documented](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/AllThatGlitters_RFS_2008.pdf) a tendency for individual investors to buy stock darlings.\n\nIn the case of Robinhood, they argue it\u2019s even more extreme, since many users are first-time investors on a platform that offers frictionless trading and only limited information. For instance, users buy equities on the app\u2019s \u201cTop Mover\u201d list more aggressively than other individual investors, meaning they\u2019re more likely to trade extreme losers as well as winners.\n\n\u201cHow information is displayed can both help and hurt investors,\u201d wrote the team, which also included Xing Huang at Washington University in St. Louis and Chris Schwarz at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThe simplified user interface influences investors decision.\u201d",

        "selftext": "I've been trading stocks for \\~15 years and options for \\~10. I have a full-time job and just do this on the side, but I've seen and tried a lot of stuff. \n\nOne of my favorite trading strategies involves selling SPX put credit spreads around 9-10 delta (2-5% OTM), 2 days to expiration. Crazy, right? Yeah, sounds like it. But bear with me while I lay out the nitty-gritty. I like the strategy so much that I've decided to (finally) lay it out in full detail for others to learn.\n\nMy inspiration for this started after reading and following Karsten's \"Passive income through option writing\" from [EarlyRetirementNow.com](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/09/28/passive-income-through-option-writing-part1/). He lays out his reasoning and thought process way better than I ever could, so if you like what you see here, go check out his stuff as well for more research and a twist on what I'm doing.\n\n**What I Do**\n\nEvery Monday, Wednesday, &amp; Friday, I sell (open) new put credit spreads on SPX that expire at the closest expiration. So, Monday, I sell SPX spreads that expire Wednesday. Wednesday, I sell spreads that expire Friday. Friday, I sell spreads that expire Monday. I hold these all the way to expiration and then open a new position with the next expiration. 95% of the time, these expire worthless and I collect full premium. The other 5% of the time, I suffer a small or large loss. Over the long run, the expected return blows the market out of the water....which leads me to:\n\n**Expected Return**\n\nI've been running this since May 2019 and am averaging something around **150% APY** based on max risk for the spread. It's absurd. \n\n**Risk &amp; Drawdown**\n\nThis massive positive return doesn't come at a cost, of course. And if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. And the cost here is that, yeah, while annual return is a ridiculous 150%, max drawdown can be 100% or more. ***Whaaaaat?!*** Yeah, that's right. While these spreads expire worthless 95% of the time, the other 5% can result in huge losses. These losses can accumulate up to 100% or more depending on the environment. \n\nSo this is a guaranteed way to blow up your account, right? Well, it is if you allocate too much capital to it. But if you keep your allocation small (which I do), then a 100%+ drawdown for this one strategy will be a small fraction of your overall portfolio. I personally only allocate about 10% of my total portfolio to this. What that means is that if/when this trading plan suffers a 100% loss, that only represents 10% drawdown for my portfolio, and I can tap into my other investments to \"replenish\" this trading plan.\n\nThese massive losses do happen, but they don't last long. I ran this very strategy through COVID-19 when VIX moved from 13 to 85 in a month, and my max drawdown was \"only\" about 125%. I reloaded from my other investments, and this put selling strategy recovered and turned green in 2020 before the market itself did...after I went down 125%.\n\n**Pennies, Meet Steamroller, Right?**\n\nYeah, this is pretty close to the definition of picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. There's nothing inherently wrong with that IF:\n\n1. The pennies that you collect add up to more than what the steamroller takes away\n2. You limit allocation so that when the steamroller hits you, it doesn't destroy you\n\n\\#1 - I collect around 2.3% premium per position compared to max risk (spread width). 95% of the time, they expire worthless, so I keep the full 2.3%. The other 5% of the time, I suffer what is usually a large loss, averaging around 20%. Do the math here: 95 \\* 2.3 is 220% gain on the wins. 5 \\* 20% is 100% loss on the losers. 220% - 100% makes for a very positive expected return...So that takes care of #1. The pennies I collect far outweigh the steamroller when it hits me.\n\n\\#2 - I only allocate 10% of my overall portfolio to this. When the steamroller hits me and results in a 100% loss for the strategy, I'm not wiped out. That's only 10% drawdown on my account, which is easy to recover from. This is what so many people miss when talking about the ole steamroller. If you just keep allocation in check, it's *okay* to get hit by a steamroller every now and then.\n\n**Trade Process - Timing &amp; Strike Selection**\n\nThe process here is simple. Every M/W/F afternoon, open a new set of put spreads expiring at the next expiration. Monday's position expires Wednesday. Wednesday's position expires Friday. Friday's position expires Monday. My short strike is around 9-10 delta. My long strike is 100-150 points below that. This results in a short strike around 2% OTM in low IV environments and 5% OTM in high IV environments. The long strike will be 5-10% OTM, again depending on IV. It'll be farther out as VIX rises. \n\nYou only suffer max loss if the S&amp;P500 drops 5% in a day or two out of absolutely nowhere (VIX &lt; 15), or if S&amp;P500 drops 10% in a day or two ***after*** freefall has already started. In 18 months, and with VIX rocketing to 85 during that timeframe, not once has one of my spreads even seen max loss....I'm sure it'll happen at some point, but if didn't happen in 2020, I'm curious to see when it would happen.\n\n**Why SPX**\n\n* 3 expirations available every week (Monday/Wednesday/Friday)\n* Highly liquid\n* Cash-settled. No underlying given to me on assignment.\n* Low trading fees (for me personally - your mileage may vary)\n* Beneficial tax treatment (60/40% long-term based on IRS 1256 contract straddles)\n* Less \"paperwork\" to file for taxes. Futures and index options aggregate together on IRS tax forms, eliminating 200 line items from this trading strategy in a year\n\nSPX is awesome.\n\n**Alternatives to SPX**\n\nSome of you may not have access to SPX options. Or your account isn't large enough to be handle SPX options. They are huge. A single contract represents $300k notional. The cash-settlement and risk-defined trades help diminish the impact of size, but it's still a lot of underlying to carry around. /ES (futures) are half the size and should work as well (just be sure you understand fees, assignment, and liquidity first). SPY can also work and is even smaller than /ES. Again, understand assignment of shares and fees. You also lose the tax benefit with SPY. But on smaller accounts, this may be the only viable option.\n\n**More Reading + Full Trade Log and Performance History**\n\nI set up a website dedicated to just this one strategy. It's not an interactive website or anything. I'm not selling anything or pushing a service/newsletter. It's just a place where I can define the strategy in way more detail than I've done here, and also a place where I can maintain a current and updated log of all of my trades and performance history. To learn more about the strategy and see actual trades/performance, check out the website: \n\n[https://wealthyoption.com](https://wealthyoption.com/)\n\nI am ***not*** selling or advertising anything on that site, whether my own stuff or somebody else's. Yes, there's a donate page up there, but that's not why I created the site and not why I posted this. But if you find this, love it, and want to return the favor, there's at least that option.\n\n**Questions / Suggestions**\n\nIf you're interested in this but have questions/concerns, fire away. I like to teach people, and I'm here to help.\n\nOr, if you're a pro or tried something like this before and see or know something that I'm missing, let me know that as well. Try to blast holes in my trading plan! I feel good enough about it now to finally share with the masses....but if there are any glaring holes or flaws, I want to know what those are.\n\n**Hope you enjoyed reading!!**",

However, the ride-hailing companies won the Proposition 22 referendum that exempts it from reclassifying gig workers.\u00a0\n\nIn a bid to garner support for the referendum, the companies had guaranteed other benefits such as health insurance for drivers who work 15 hours or more a week, occupational-accident insurance coverage, and 30 cents for every mile driven, among other protections.",

        "selftext": "# PLTR OVER $30 USD IN EUROPE. FREE TOYS AT THE BOTTOM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWelp my friends. Like 2 days ago I said if Palantir made it to $30 by the end of the year, I\u2019d give out a PS5 to someone in this subreddit.\n\nWhile a 50% gain over 6 weeks sounded aggressive, turns out things are moving a tad faster around here.\n\nLooks like we are over $30 in Europe. Fuck it. Let\u2019s do this draw now. It\u2019s American Thanksgiving after all.\n\n\\--\n\nBut before I live up to my promise and get into the details of how you enter this draw, I think I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t use this opportunity to get my thoughts in about Palantir.\n\n**First and foremost, will everyone who is calling PLTR a quote \u201cmeme stock\u201d shut the hell up?**\n\nJust because a bunch of gorilla IQ memers happen to be buying something, does not mean that the thing they are buying is stupid. All those dingleberries also own Androids and iPhones, does that doesn\u2019t mean Google and Apple are \u201cmeme companies\u201d? No.\n\nUnlike actual meme stocks such as: unprofitable weed companies, camera companies gone pharma, car rental companies gone bankrupt, and little airlines living off corporate welfare - Palantir is actually a ROCK SOLID COMPANY with an extremely promising future.\n\nThis rally was predictable and **it will keep on going in the long run.**\n\nMyself and many others in WSB, r/investing and r/stocks got in on day one - not out of chance - but because we did our due diligence and we could see the writing on the wall: Palantir has the potential to possibly become one of the most important tech companies in the world, and it is being led by people with a track record to back it up.\n\nThis stock isn\u2019t mooning because we have posted 10,000 memes and shit posts. I'm sorry kiddos and Cramer, but our TikTok videos with a few thousand views aren't powerful enough to create $25B of stock market value.\n\nThere is something much larger at play here, and we in WSB are lucky enough to be along for the ride.\n\nPLTR is heading to Mars because the financial institutions didn\u2019t have the opportunity to get in before the IPO and now they are racing to catch up. Moreover, now that **Palantir\u2019s first quarterly report has proven they are the real deal,** and everyone has started googling this pandora\u2019s box of a company - the market is going \u201choly shit\u201d.\n\nThe only question mark that was in Palantir\u2019s path was the impact Joe Biden\u2019s administration might have on the company's relationship with the US government.\n\nWith a former Palantir consultant Avril Haines at the helm of the entire US intelligence community as of this week, the risk of the new administration working against Palantir has been all but removed.\n\nThat\u2019s why we are up bigly this week.\n\nBut more importantly, **you need to consider the global technological context of this company, to truly understand its future potential.**\n\n1. In the 90\u2019s PC\u2019s took over. \n2. In the 2000\u2019s it was all about the .coms.\n3. The 2010\u2019s was the era of wireless and mobile platforms.\n4. 2020 WILL be the decade of smart automation through a global wifi network.\n\nAnd because of that, there is now an information and technology cold war brewing. China and USA are racing to get control of the global internet infrastructure, and they are doing everything they can to invent true AI. \n\nOnce the entire world and everything in your home goes \u201csmart\u201d and becomes connected to Starlink\u2019s grid, someone or some*thing* is going to need to sift through the quintillions of zeroes and ones, to make sense of it all in real time. Guess who is **the only company in the world that has the know-how and business/political connections to fill that void?**\n\nAt the risk of getting too deep in the weeds here, I need to mention one last detail: You all need to read up on Project Maven.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Project Maven is an AI drone project that Google was originally supposed to fulfill for the US Airforce. Google walked from the contract citing \"ethical\" concerns, and then Palantir picked up the pieces. Imagine how pissed the US Airforce was when Google called them unethical and embarrassed them?\n\nThis has a **very** important underlying implication. If you accept the premise that the American government is going ham in this technological revolution, there still remains the question as to who will be the primary benefactor. \n\nCommon sense would suggest that companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft will be working with the US government to create AI. However, Project Maven changed all that. \n\nGoogle's refusal to fulfill their top secret contract taught the government that they cannot trust the trillion dollar megacaps to be unequivocally and unapologetically pro-USA. Those companies are so big, that they don't need to choose a side in geopolitics, and they will almost certainly continue to offer their products to everyone around the world. \n\nWhen it comes to matters of national cybersecurity, the odds are that **the US government is going to put all it's eggs in a company that is unquestionably loyal and patriotic.** When the pentagon is creating a trillion dollar AI behemoth, they know they need to work with someone they can trust when push comes to shove. Palantir is the only AI company that is bold enough to do so, and **their founders have created a special the corporate share structure to ensure they will never lose control**.\n\nSo again, this is not a fucking \"meme stock\".\n\nPLTR is mooning like your pubescent boner on viagra because everyone is starting to realize that this **magnificent titan the CIA created** (*see In-Q-Tel*) has gone public and will probably be at the forefront of the next global technological revolution.\n\nSo: \n\n* Stop worrying about a dip next week. (*Yes it might happen. So what?*)\n* Stop worrying about a price crash post lock up. (*This will happen. But from what price to what price? Who cares?*)\n* Stop trying to time the market to squeeze out an extra $1000. (*We aren\u2019t smart enough or fast enough to win that game.*)\n* Stop viewing Palantir like it\u2019s a penny stock. It\u2019s not.\n\n**Start** looking at the year 2030 and imagine what you will do with your money then, if you grow the man balls (or lady balls) required to hold that long.\n\nHow you handle your positions over the next 6-12 months may be the most important decision of your life: do... not... sell\u2026\n\nThere are only a handful of times in your life when a person should truly go all in. 1) When you meet the person you know you want to marry. When you decide to change your career. And when a company like Palantir goes public.\n\nIn 10 years, you can thank me. Today, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nGod speed.\n\n\\--\n\nNow for the fun stuff.\n\n# RULES:\n\n* You must be 18 or older to enter.\n* You must be in a country where you are able to receive shipments from Walmart, Amazon, Bestbuy and/or Gamestop.\n* Your reddit account must be at least 1 week old to claim the prize.\n* There are no financial or trading requirements for this draw.

        "selftext": "  \n\nAlright guys, so a couple of days ago I took one too many Adderall and in order to burn through the high, I went through Roblox\u2019s financial statements in depth. And let me tell you, the numbers I found in there, literally makes my bull cock hard. Let me show you why in this post.  \n\nFor this analysis I will first start off with a general intro into Roblox; more specifically, I will talk about what it is, what it does, and how it makes its revenue. Then I will examine the micro factors by looking at the company\u2019s financial statements and identify any notable patterns and items of interest that can affect future profitability. Let\u2019s begin. \n\nWhat Is Roblox And Where Does Its Money Come From\n\nRoblox started off in 2004 as a platform for human co-experience which is done in user-generated 3D digital worlds that the company considers to be the \u201cnew form of social interaction\u201d (*This part is key, social interaction, it is what sets Roblox apart from a lot of these gaming and social media companies that I will get to later on)*. From there, growth at the company is driven primarily from investment in technology and two mutually reinforcing network effects: content and social. This means that the more high-quality content the users create, the more additional users are attracted to the platform, and the cycle repeats. While this is going on, the company profits off of this through two main revenue streams: the sale of its virtual currency Robux *(Its primary source of revenue)*, and subscription to Roblox Premium. Both of these I will get into later on. \n\nPutting all of this together means the company is **NOT** a gaming company like EA, nor is it purely a social media or user-generated content company like Facebook or YouTube; rather, the company is a mix of all three. I say this because unlike a traditional gaming company like EA who spends millions each year developing a new game that may or may not turn into shit with their fanbase *(every A.C game after Ezio)*, Roblox just sits back, relax, and let their own content creators do the heavy lifting by creating games on their platform which draws in the users, which in turn purchases the microtransactions on Robux and subscribes to Roblox Premium. \n\nNow, the reason why I say Roblox is similar in some sense to Facebook and YouTube is that on Roblox you to can create friends and social groups with people you meet in real life and on their virtual world. There you can exchange ideas, build worlds together, or just play games and chat to each other. Much like a Facebook account, some people log on to Roblox purely to chat with their friends for extended periods of time. Now in terms of YouTube, the biggest similarity Roblox has with the content creating company is that Roblox\u2019s content creators are **PAID** **and paid well.** In 2020, its content creators are estimated to make $250m, that\u2019s more than double the $110m they made in 2019 (*The money Roblox pays to its content creators are called Developer Exchange Fees on their S-1*). The creators earn money whenever a user spends their virtual currency in one of their games **and** how much time premium users spend in their games. For some of their games, Roblox will share as much as 70% of the proceeds with the content creators [(https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/28/roblox-expects-to-pay-250-million-to-its-mostly-teen-developers-this-year/#:\\~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20Roblox's%20developers%20are,of%20Premium%20subscribers%20in%2Dgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/(https:/venturebeat.com/2020/07/28/roblox-expects-to-pay-250-million-to-its-mostly-teen-developers-this-year/%23:~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20Roblox's%20developers%20are,of%20Premium%20subscribers%20in-game)). So unlike YouTube, where they try to penny pinch anyway they can, Roblox actually recognizes that their content creators are the key to their growth strategy and will make sure that they are well compensated in order to sustain their growth engine and judging on the fact that their daily active user (DAU) growth is a whopping **96.86%** YoY based on their Q3 figures, it\u2019s probably a winning strategy (*page 107 of S-1*). \n\nLastly, it is also important to note that a lot of the growth in DAU and bookings is driven by the pandemic lockdowns, but a look into the company\u2019s operating metrics will show that the company has enjoyed significant growth in users, hours engaged, and bookings well before the pandemic, which means that the company should be able to continuously grow at a significant pace even post covid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hq6r394ysf161.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d58768665b55dcd618de9cffec49bbc8b7c702be\n\n  \n\n**TL;DR** Any analyst saying Roblox is a \u2018gaming\u2019 company is the equivalent of them saying Tesla is just another \u2018automobile\u2019 company and giving it a $200PT ([Roblox S-1 IPO filing released - cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/roblox-s-1-ipo-filing-released.html)). They\u2019re retarded and so are you if you\u2019re listening to them. Roblox is a mix of a gaming and social media company with explosive growth in DAU.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  **The Financials**\n\n***Balance Sheet***\n\nLooked at the statement and its absolutely fucking solid. Here is a snapshot so you know I\u2019m not pulling this out of my ass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwqw0i74tf161.png?width=943&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcfbd4c78af77777b555a046d08ff922f2979ad4\n\n  \n\nAs you can see, both current(1,212,259) and total assets(1,489,541) are greater than their current(904,302) and total liabilities(1,436,664). This means this company is both liquid and solvent so it is strong on a balance sheet perspective. One liability I want to focus on however is their deferred revenue, which is by far the largest liability the company has on their balance sheet. For all you non-accountants out there, deferred revenue is unearned revenue, meaning they received payment for a service that they have yet to provide. For Roblox, that service refers to the perks that come from the purchases of Robux or subscription to Roblox Premium. The company also refers to the purchase of Robux as bookings and will accrue these liabilities and the revenue generated from them over the average lifetime of a paying user which is 23 months(*page 23 of S-1*). This means that this liability will not result in future cash outflow, which means the company will be less restricted in investing more into itself or continue to pay its content creators. \n\n**TL;DR**: Company is solid based on balance sheet fundamentals. Their largest liability is their unearned/deferred revenue which isn\u2019t going to create a cash outflow that will impact future investments. \n\n  \n\n**Income Statement**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mphvkz9ctf161.png?width=895&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c416e32fc628b5f29e58091be1e993c7ce0bf13\n\n  \n\nThe first thing you are going to notice is the explosive revenue growth of 68% (588,675 / 349,888) which shows that the company is doing really well during the pandemic. In addition, the company is able to keep its core operating expenses growth stable to its revenue growth while keeping its other expenses such as G&amp;A and Sales/Marketing to a bare minimum. This shows that the management of Roblox knows how to run a tight ship. In addition, it can be argued that a lot of these expenses are really an investment into the company\u2019s own future, such as paying content creators (Developer exchange fees), investing in infrastructure, and research and development. Honestly, I would prefer the company to run up losses on these expenses early on in order to help scale its growth than to have them do it later on. \n\n**TL;DR:** Revenue growth is high for years and the majority of expenses are attributed to the company investing those proceeds into the business and its operations which in turn will help fuel future growth. \n\n   **Conclusion**\n\nThis is a truly unique company that combines all the best characteristics of the gaming, social media, and content creation industries. The company has solid fundamentals, strong revenue, and user growth, and will most likely significantly scale their business upwards for the foreseeable future.  Even though this company is most likely going to turn into a WSB meme, the fundamentals themselves support large price appreciation in the stock. \n\nGet in retards. \n\nI plan to buy stocks when they IPO, and switch half my holdings into leap calls when options become available.",

A Home Depot spokesperson declined to share specifics on how much the company\u2019s average hourly wage will increase after the investment.\n\n\u201cIt varies market by market.

[According to Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/The-Home-Depot-Hourly-Pay-E655.htm), the average hourly wage for a Home Depot cashier is $11 an hour.

Target raised its starting minimum wage to $13 an hour in June as part of a commitment unveiled in 2017 to reach $15 an hour by 2020.\n\nWalmart in September lifted its minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 an hour for some 165,000 workers.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer\u2019s pay hike comes as the company calls for lawmakers to enact a new stimulus plan for those unemployed because of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI think the lack of stimulus is showing up more so with those unemployed, small businesses and people that need help. I think it\u2019s important that we all understand in some ways we are having a shared experience because we are in a pandemic together, but we are having a very different experience.

        "selftext": "I've been seeing a lot of comparisons between GME now and the VW short squeeze back in 2008. For those of you who've been living under a rock, GME's short is currently more the entire number of outstanding shares. This is a very interesting, but the more important fact is that the number of shares sold short is roughly 3x the entire float. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udkkxz9ok1261.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f98f9645d9e2bf94dc3ccbd409f2d2b375be6d91\n\nThis is very important, as to cover short positions, MM's will have to buy from the float, the greater the Short % of Float, the greater the squeeze. In comparison, VW had a short float of just under 13% right before the insane short squeeze. Now, roughly 30-35% of VW shares were in the float, with Porsche holding 42.6%, the state of Lower Saxony holding 20%, and about 5-6% held by passive investors. This made the Short % of Float about 40%, far less than GME currently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe short squeeze occurred because Porsche announced that they were going to exercise options to buy another 31.5% of the float, taking their total up to 74.1%, and had plans to hold 75% of VW the following year. This triggered a squeeze as shorts rushed to buy to cover before Porsche exercised the options. As you can see from the graph, VW's share price jumped nearly 5x, and then quickly fell back down. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8720v4xm1261.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116f1045eacf3e73ecde3e44868b0867ca0b1231\n\nA GME short squeeze will likely do the same thing, with possibly an even greater climb. However, this is no sure thing. To trigger the squeeze, GME would likely need to demonstrate long term profitability and growth. If MM's continue to believe GME's business model is dead, they will continue to be short as they can wait the 2 years it takes for GME to die. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the play, I personally think that GME is going to use the boost from console revenue to change its business model and help GME adapt to the tech age. With an already decent supply of cash (735 million as of 7/31/20), as well as major investors like Michael Burry (Big Short Guy) and Ryan Cohen (CHWY co-Founder) backing GME, all we need is a change in business model to trigger the squeeze. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Call leaps if you love to gamble your life savings, Shares if you're slightly less of a degenerate than the rest of us",

The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Apex, as well as the Board of Directors of AvePoint and it is expected to finalise in Q1 2021\n\n**// About AvePoint**\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:\n\n* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way\n\n[Company's Footprint](https://preview.redd.it/hc09mm676r161.png?width=2336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcd7d11a2681c0cc6d44c7a0f79996caf32b8a1)\n\n* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \\~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company\u2019s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC).

Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth.

Explosive data growth, increasing data regulations, shifts to the cloud, hyper growth of Microsoft Teams were all trends that fuelled the growth prior to the pandemic. The impacts of COVID-19 have greatly accelerated these trends\n\n[Current and Future Potential](https://preview.redd.it/jwg00s6d6r161.png?width=2704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03e3dcfdd8f3fea45a494e49e9bb81d55857287a)\n\n* The company raised $200 million in January this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs. The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before the reverse merger announcement\n\n**// About APXT**\n\n* Outstanding management: led by Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein (\\*cough\\* didn\u2019t kill himself \\*cough\\*) and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig.

I would buy R1, forget about it all the way to 80% capital invested TP @ \\~+30%. Look at the overall market conditions in Dec and TP the remaining funds @ +60% upside.

        "selftext": "They always make fun of us ~~traders~~ gamblers here at r/WallStreetBets, but who \\*really\\* has the last laugh? Is it us Chads while we eat our crayons on the way to the Lambo shop? Or are the virgin traders truly better than us?\n\nI'm going to show you something. Something that's never been seen by human eyes, never computed by any type of algorithm, something our wive's boyfriends wouldn't even pay attention to. This is the WallStreetBets sentiment and hype detection.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that WallStreetBets is #1 when it comes to finding trends and finding stocks. It doesn't matter if this is after-the-fact that the stock price shot up 50% in 2 days. It doesn't matter that the stock is something nobody paid attention to until finally the whole world start trading it (PLTR). What it comes down to is the fact that WSB will find literally any stock after it has already mooned. Stock up 10% for the day? WSB knows about it. Stock up 20% in the last week? WSB has already traded it. It's genius.\n\n**Here's the kicker**. \\*Most\\* times after a stock has mooned once and WSB hops on the trend, the stock will go through another 1 or 2 periods of \"mooning\". If you are new to the industry of printing tendies, grab a tequila on the rocks and have a drink with me while I go through some sentiment on the WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not even going to start with PLTR (Palantir) because that would be too obvious. Let's start with XPEV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**XPEV**\n\nLook at this sentiment chart. The stock wasn't even mentioned a single time until some autist found an alternative EV company to gamble on after it shot up 10% in a single day.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/un64jt1z47261.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=311103e4373fa04790226cebe751d1d35ca9aa9b\n\n1st wave sentiment peaked at 3% of the sub-reddit's comment volume. What happened next? The stock stayed flat for 7 days and you autists completely forgot about it. Next stop - Wave 2: Comment volume peaking at roughly 5% of all comments after the stock price went from $33 to $43 in one day. Massive spike in chatter around the ticker and the stock price continues it's meteoric climb for a whole month. You can see another 1 or 2 waves where sentiment rises after big moves in stock prices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CRSR**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0scjg83257261.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbaca71ea742ea0c1431dde33304aa009c277ba8\n\nNext up is Corsair Gaming. None of you autists even knew the stock existed 2 months ago. We can see wave 1 happened early November with small gains in the stock price. Sentiment was steady as autists everywhere were drooling over consistent gains for the first time, loving every minute of it, kind of like when you kiss your cousin for the first time. Wasn't long after we see wave 2 and 3 of the trend where the stock continues it's mission to Mars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**LI** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alxnfwz257261.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c9ebd19dec396d22ad8146e8fb1732277cd10e0\n\nNext we'll look at LI. 99% of you, including myself, don't even know what this company does. All we know is that STOCKS ONLY GO UP. The first wave happened 3 weeks ago when comment volume reached 5% of all the comments on the sub-reddit. Stock price shot up 30% in a single day. Sounds insane that the momentum would continue upward, but it has. Not only that, the stock price has gone up another 30% in the last 3 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PLTR**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vs5zaon357261.png?width=1630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f6c883545d1bf1b550890d7c4ad4518dafdde02\n\nThe PLTR sentiment chart is nothing short of magnificent for a sentiment junkie like myself. Comment volume has been rising at the same rate as the stock price. On Friday roughly 50% of discussion comments mentioned the ticker PLTR. Something that you either loved or found incredibly annoying. The only other tickers to ever break the 50% comment volume barrier are Tesla and NIO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhat's the next meme stock going to be? Is it GME? Do we regress back to PRPL gang? Nobody really knows, but one thing I can agree with is that wave 1 of the trend is almost always the early adopters with gorilla balls willing to risk large amounts of capital on a stock nobody's ever traded before. Once a few believers hop on the train the whole sub-reddit jumps on the bandwagon headed to hell or Valhalla.",

I chose lots of risky investments in the hospitality and travel industries because that\u2019s what I know, and I knew who would survive the shutdown. \n\nI also dove into options trading for a short while during lockdown. I ended up losing 20% of my portfolio to options (options are not my jam apparently lol) , and then I gained 70% profit with my stocks. \n\nThis week I officially cashed out all of my portfolio for an overall 55% gain in 7 months. Definitely happy with that but it would have been more if I never played the option gamble. \n\nI thought i would hold on to these investments longer... but with lingering talks about another shutdown and with covid cases skyrocketing, I foresee the market taking a huge hit again, especially if Biden holds on to his presumed win. \n\nSo here I am, waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen with covid, the election, and the beginning of 2021.\n\nThe huge boost from vaccine news was enough for me to say screw it and sell mostly everything. It\u2019s not everyday that your entire portfolio jumps 30% in one morning. \n\nHappy with that decision but now I\u2019m lurking to make my next investment plan when the economy figures itself out over the next couple of months.\n\nAnyone else cash out this week?",

Last year, more than half of the items sold on Amazon worldwide were from these outside merchants.\nAmazon faces a possible fine of up to 10% of its annual worldwide revenue, which could amount to billions of dollars. The company rejected the accusations.\n\u201cWe disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and will continue to make every effort to ensure it has an accurate understanding of the facts,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nThe company can, under EU rules, reply to the charges in writing and present its case in an oral hearing.\nIt\u2019s the EU\u2019s latest effort to curb the power of big technology companies, following a series of multibillion dollar antitrust fines against Google in previous years.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nAlright guys, it\u2019s your favorite Adderall munching retard back again with another stock DD (here is link to my last one [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0z2zy/an_in_depth_look_into_robloxrblx_and_why_i_am/). This time I\u2019m going to look at another potential meme stock that is being COMPLETELY overlooked by WSB and why it has the extremely high probability of just exploding in value like Palantir come 2021. \n\nNow my analysis of CCL is broken down into 5 parts: Covid Vaccine, credit market sentiment, insider trades, pent-up demand, and the balance sheet. Since this post is pretty long, a TL;DR will be provided at the top of each section. \n\n  \n\n**Covid Vaccine**\n\n**TL;DR:** High probability of vaccine rollout in the US starting early to mid-2021. Once this news hit the market, investors will start pricing in a post covid world for travel companies and the stock could go back to ATHs as things go \u201cback to normal.\u201d\n\nWith the recent announcement of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines having a 95% efficacy rate, we are starting to see a massive shift into cyclical stocks and some capital outflow away from WFH stocks like Zoom. Although I am still long-term bullish on these tech stocks, I still believe that this flow into cyclicals still have a LONG WAY to go before it is exhausted. The reason why I am saying this is because travel stocks like CCL, AAL, etc are still trading more closely to their March lows than their ATHs pre pandemic. This is our opportunity because I believe the reason why travel stocks haven\u2019t yet recovered to their ATHs like tech is that even though a vaccine is priced in, the rollout of it has yet to be. Right now there is no solid set date but I think that a 2021 rollout of vaccines in the U.S has a very high probability. The reason why I say this is because the US will be the first country to rollout its vaccine ([vaccine date](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/28/america-will-be-the-first-country-to-roll-out-a-covid-19-vaccine)) and in Canada where I live, our government already said that the Pfizer vaccine will receive the green light this year and we can start receiving the first shipments of it early next year ([Rollout Timeline](https://globalnews.ca/news/7489967/coronavirus-vaccine-available-canada/)). Once these dates become more set in stone, I believe the market will start pricing in a world post covid and this could be the catalyst to boost travel and tourism back to their ATHs and maybe even higher. Right now, I think one of the main reason why a lot of investors are hesitant to invest in CCL is because of the winter months and they want to see how it all rolls out, but remember, stocks are forward-looking and once vaccines are being rolled out, don\u2019t be surprised if this final barrier of price resistance is broken and investors start rushing in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  **Credit Market Sentiment**  \n\n**TL;DR:** Bond traders are extremely bullish on this company meaning that the fundamentals are still rock solid despite the no sail order. Because of this stock is extremely oversold and is trading well below what its justified based on core fundamentals. \n\nSince most of you probably don\u2019t know this, CCL did two major debt offerings during the pandemic, and boy oh boy did the investors gobble up every dollar. \n\nCCL did their first debt offering back in April 1 by issuing out $4bil in debt that paid 11.5% coupon. Demand was so great for the bond that of the $4bil offered, $17bil was used to bid up the price. It was so frenzied that Carnival decided to issue out an extra billion AND cut its coupon rate, something that was unheard of in an investment grade company ([Debt Issuance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/record-752-billion-of-bond-sales-shows-rush-for-cash-buffers)). \n\nYeah you read that right. When the stock of the company is cratering down into the 9 levels of hell, bond investors remain extremely bullish on the company. This might seem confusing to some of you but keep in mind that credit investors look at different factors than equity investors. In the credit market, transactions are still done dealer to dealer and investors are mostly concerned with whether or not a company is able to pay back its debt with its future earnings buy focusing on the fundamentals. Because of this, credit markets are often a good indication on a company\u2019s fundamental value and where the economy is likely to head in the near future. Judging by the high demand for the company\u2019s debt it would appear that despite having a no sail order, the fundamentals of the company remain relatively intact and the stock is most likely extremely oversold back in March. \n\nCCL\u2019s second offering was a couple of weeks ago in November and guess what, investors gobbled up that shit to. This time the company issued $2bil worth of debt and unlike last time, the company won\u2019t pledge collateral. The demand for CCL\u2019s bonds are so high right now that the debt they issued in April at just under 12% is now trading at a significant premium and yielding only 5%. This means whoever bought their debt back in April can now turn around and sell those bonds back to market at a massive gain because with bonds, the interest rate goes down, price go up. \n\nTo sum this part up, it would appear that the credit market is extremely bullish on the long-term prospects of this company. Since the credit market is more focused on the fundamentals, it would appear that the sell off back in March was extremely over done for the company and the stocks are most likely trading at a heavy discount. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Insider Trades**\n\n**TL;DR:** Company insiders are eating up shares like a fat kid does cookies. I have never seen such rampant insider buying before. Get in retards. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7Paying attention to what the company\u2019s executives and BoD are doing are a pretty good way of seeing where the company is likely to go in the near future. So I went on Quiver Quantitative and gentlemen, what I found was truly shocking. Here is a snapshot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/imb2fskxte261.png?width=1611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9356324fcb6128da8ba67e6e9528c27358e71370\n\nWhat you are seeing there is a ratio of almost 21:1 for shares bought to sold. This is probably the highest ratio I have ever seen for any stock, ever. What this means is that company insiders are extremely bullish on this company and if they are willing to put this much money where their mouth is, you should probably to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Society\u2019s View On Cruises**\n\n**TL;DR:** People that go on cruises could not give two shits about the coronavirus. There is an extremely high pent-up demand for cruises to resume as shown by the 100,000 volunteers that showed up for a trial cruise by Royal Caribbean.  \n\nI\u2019m going to keep this part simple. People don\u2019t care about the virus as much as the media likes to put them out to be. Right now there is SERIOUS pent-up demand for cruises to be back at full steam again. A good example of this is that recently Royal Caribbean wanted to arrange trial cruises in order to convince regulators that it can run successful Covid-free trips. Guess how many volunteers the company could find? 100? 1,000? Well, if you guessed 100,000 you are correct ([Link](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/royal-caribbean-cdc-trial-cruises-covid/index.html)). \n\nThe company is completely blown away by this and it really shows how much pent up demand there is for cruises. \n\nAs an icing on the cake, here is a link for a Joe Rogan clip in which he discusses cruises with guest Tim Dillon: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmSpQq60-Ls&amp;ab_channel=JREClips) \n\nThis clip essentially explains what cruise people are really like and whether or not the industry is simply going to \u201cgo away.\u201d Spoilers, it\u2019s not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n**TL;DR:** Financial statements are rock solid. Total assets outweigh total liabilities by a long margin meaning company is extremely solvent. Current cash outflow suggests that the company has more than enough to outlast most of 2021 without having to raise capital. Lastly, company can also easily raise debt to handle any short term liquidity needs. \n\nThe balance sheet is fucking solid. Total assets out-weigh total liabilities by 19.5bil which should put to rest any fears of solvency. Current assets are about 900million short of current liabilities but judging by the ease in which the company can raise cash, liquidity shouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s21qncpbue261.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=616caf3b2be1088492d14fe650214bae6f5c3be9\n\nIn addition I also looked at their operating cash flow and with 0 cruises, they have -4.6bil operating CF for 9 months ended. But considering their current cash balance of 8.1bil, they easily have enough cash to cover most of 2021 and that\u2019s not even considering raising capital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/srkqasbfue261.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9563579ab2ba5054962186c6d06ef14ac4bb9498\n\n**The Play**\n\nPlay stocks or long term ITM or ATM calls. The idea is to profit off of the potential pop in price come 2021 when things most likely get back to normal when the vaccine rolls out. Do not buy far OTM or FDs for this play as anything can happen to the rollout causing a dip in price. If you are buying options go for options that expire preferably near year-end 2021. That way theta gang won\u2019t eat you alive if vaccine rollout gets delayed.",

He sees the potential short squeeze opportunity. Ryan Cohen could be holding massive amount of ITM calls which he can exercise and reduce the supply of shares significantly. This way, he could easily takeover the company with the shares his holding and possibly even ride the short squeeze with us. This would force the shorts the cover. Similar to what happened in 2008 with Volkswagen.\n\n[https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)\n\n\\- Or, Cohen could actually plan a hostile takeover and call up a proxy vote.

        "selftext": " \n\nYou can\u2019t be a serious trader without really understanding tax strategies. I know it\u2019s some boring accountant BS, but it\u2019s one of the few things, other than $420 TSLA calls and shorting NKLA at $50, that is actually free money. Good tax decisions save you money in most cases with little or no change to your risk level. I regularly see people do stuff on this forum that is exposing them to huge tax liability. And, doing it wrong can cause you to actually zero out your account AND owe a ton of money next year.  So, here\u2019s a crash course on how to do this. The year is almost over, and you need to do this stuff NOW to be in good shape for your tax bill next year. \n\n**The basics:**\n\nTaxes are incurred in a few ways. First, whenever you SELL a security, you realize a gain or loss that is a taxable event. Secondly, when you hold 1256 contracts at year end you get marked to market (oil futures, NDX, SPX, etc). You usually wont have these. And lastly when you receive dividends, which no one on this sub ever has.\n\nOf course, you only get taxed on gains\u2026 offset by losses that you made in the past or the SAME YEAR. The big danger with a year like this is you have massive gains that you\u2019ve realized\u2026 which means you\u2019ll owe massive taxes. If you trade with that money and lose it next year, you\u2019ll not be able to mark those against your gains, and you could hypothetically zero out your account with a dumb trade next year, AND owe a ton of taxes. Also note that if you are at a net loss, you don\u2019t owe tax, and the residual losses carry forward to protect you from taxes on the same amount of some future gain. I believe you apply STCG to STCL first, but in the absence of that, you can use LTCL. Same for LTCG vs LTCL, THEN STCL.\n\nThese taxes are generally due the following year (unless you made a ton, more on that later), and will generally be your top income tax rate plus a little (ACA surcharge of a few %), unless you have LTCG (unlikely on this forum), or have a lot of losses to offset (likely on this forum).  \n\nLastly, each position has \u2018tax lots\u2019 which are the individual times you entered the position. If you sell less than the full position, most brokerages will try to sell whatever will cause you the least taxes, which means, it will sell to make losses first, small gains next, large gains last. \n\n**Random Tips and Things To Know:**\n\n*Doom Scenario* \u2013 If you take away one thing here \u2013 if you made big gains, realize losses to zero them out, and on anything leftover, SET ASIDE THE MONEY. You\u2019ll owe this tax on gains EVEN IF you zero out your account on January 2nd. Don\u2019t put yourself in that position.  I talk about this in detail here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqewaw/psa\\_dont\\_forget\\_to\\_lose\\_all\\_of\\_your\\_gains\\_before/\n\n*Loss Harvesting* \u2013 A common year end strategy is to dump your losers BEFORE the end of the year so you can put them against your gains. If you have some old now worthless options sitting around that wont expire until next year, there\u2019s big benefit to selling these off if you have gains.  TLDR \u2013 realize your losses, probably now or really soon. Beware wash sale though\u2026\n\n*Wash Sales* \u2013 If you sell something at a loss, and rebuy the exact same thing within 31 days, the realize is cancelled out, and the loss is added back into the cost basis of the stock. You still can get this gain, you just don\u2019t get to call it a realized loss and offset gains with it. In theory, this MAY apply to call options on the same ticker\u2026 but it\u2019s a grey area, and the IRS has not given clear guidance on this for decades despite this being a known issue. Proceed with caution here. It is agreed that if you use the EXACT SAME option, wash sale 100% applied. For different options on same ticker, it\u2019s grey and not agreed upon by CPAs (conservative rule is \u2013 assume it\u2019s a wash sale). \n\n*Splitting gains over tax years* \u2013 If you have phat gains now, hedging a bit and realizing some now, some early January may be prudent so you can spread the income over lower tax brackets. Easy strategy to do.\n\n*Holding for LTCG* \u2013 In theory, if you hold an option or stock more than a year, it becomes LTCG rate which is lower. But who does that here? Hedging these gains with put options is considered kosher with the IRS.   So, if your SHOP you got in March is up 1000% and you want to sell now, you could just buy puts into March to protect, then realize then, and pay fewer taxes.\n\n*Income Offset* \u2013 You can writeoff $3k of losses against your primary income every year for free, no questions asked. But it does eat into your loss reserve. \n\n*Estimated Quarterly Payments* \u2013 When you make lots and lots of money, you are expected to pay those income taxes before filing date in April. This varies by states, so check the rules if you are making A LOT (100k+ usually). For federal, you owe these up until the point where you have paid the full amount of federal tax you paid the previous year \u2013 amounts over this you aren\u2019t on the hook to pre-pay. There are guides online for how to play a 1040-es and so forth. TLDR - make a lot of money, check your state rules, and make sure youve paid as much federal already or will have paid by end of year as you paid last year.\n\n*Charitable Donations* \u2013 Charitable donations do reduce tax liability. Better is to DONATE SHARES to a donor advised fund, such as what Fidelity offers, then direct the DAF to give to the charity of your choice. Money in there can also appreciate over time, so you can day trade further, albeit with indexes only. The reason this is better than donating cash is you get the writeoff of the value of the shares, AND you don\u2019t cause a capital gains realize \u2013 so no capital gains tax. I would not donate options \u2013 you can, but they\u2019ll get marked to market in a somewhat unfavorable manner unless massively in the money, and even then, check before you do it!\n\n*Trader Status* \u2013 You can elect to be a trader every year at normal filing deadline. If you do, ALL of your gains/losses inside designated accounts become income instead of STCG. This is desirable because losses can then go against your income, and you also don\u2019t pay the ACA surcharge on investment income. You also can deduct more things against this. But, this has strict rules to do, and only applies if you are making dozens of trades a week, trading daily, and are really making a lot of money doing it. Note that this loses the ability to use 1256 taxation and ltcg in these accounts, so its sometimes just worse. The main advantage is in bad years you can put it against your Wendy\u2019s w2. \n\n*1256 Contracts* \u2013 These are special contracts that give you 60% LTCG and 40% LTCG regardless of the hold. XSP, SPX, NDX and RUT options do this, as do most futures contracts. They also are wash sale immune, and are grown up trader hacks. I have a long ass post about this all here, but the TLDR is that for non-long-term holds with significant amounts of money, you really should be using these instead of SPY, QQQ and IWM.  Here\u2019s my post about that:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes\\_and\\_spy\\_vs\\_spx\\_iwm\\_vs\\_rut\\_qqq\\_vs\\_ndx\\_please/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes_and_spy_vs_spx_iwm_vs_rut_qqq_vs_ndx_please/)\n\n*GLD and SLV* \u2013 These are collectibles rate. Even worse taxes on long term than normal LTCG. FYI. Here\u2019s a treatise on why you should use other vehicles than these:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop\\_overpaying\\_taxes\\_on\\_gld\\_options/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop_overpaying_taxes_on_gld_options/)\n\n*Constructive Sale* \\-  If you have a long position that has made a lot, but is unrealized, and you do some crazy option trade to basically sell it (such as selling calls that are massive in the money), the IRS may decide this is a constructive sale and call it a realize. Don\u2019t get too clever on this stuff. It usually doesn\u2019t come up, but if the tax bill is large enough, it may.\n\n*QOZ:* Special tax rules for ultra rich traders with good resources, like that guy who made $5m day trading PLTR. If you made hundreds of thousands of dollars in gains, and have net worth over a few million bucks (qualified investor comfortably), you could enroll in a QOZ. This allows you to defer payment of tax on designated gains for 6 or 7 years, get a 10% discount on the amount owed, AND the investment you make is tax free on gains AND can still do return of capital with a cash-out refi (usually real estate). Getting good QOZs is hard, they aren\u2019t easily accessible, and you\u2019ll likely want to use a family office, a rich friend, or a wealth manager if you go this route. This truly is a bonanza, but it\u2019s hard to access. You have 6 months from when you realized a gain to use this. K-1s and 1256s count as dec 31 of that year realize.",

        "selftext": "I was planning to wait a bit longer before entry, but I just couldn't resist as I witnessed some weird option price movements near the closing bell on Friday and honestly, $BABA is a steal at the current prices. \n\nI'm sure most of you are aware of Alibaba ($BABA) - currently, the largest Chinese company, the Amazon of China and the NIO of e-commerce. Recently, Alibaba, along with JD.com hit record sales numbers from the Singles Day event, but despite that, $BABA's share prices plummeted due to 3 reasons: PFE's vaccine news, Ant Groups' fail IPO and China's new anti-monopoly rules. These events sent $BABA's share price from near $315 levels down to $266 in just a few days - then slowly sliding it down to $260/share (-21% slide). What was it that the investors were so fearful of which triggered this downward slide?\n\n1. Alibaba holds a \\~33% stake in Ant Group, a fintech company (largest in the world - even bigger than Stripe), was set to IPO with a $313b USD valuation. This would be very beneficial for Alibaba and the multitude of enterprises that Alibaba has stake in. Unfortunately, this move was stopped by China due to a few reasons: lack of regulation and the increase in monopolistic competition. Hence, they drafted some monopoly regulations for review.\n2. What are these monopoly regulations and the proposals thought out by the regulators? The regulators claimed that the e-commerce market is fierce and it was merely a few products that dominate the e-commerce platforms. As a result, they believe that 1 supplier per platform would be appropriate to allow for more entrants into the market. \n\nHowever, it wasn't just Alibaba who was hit with this monopoly rule. Other big players like Tencent, [JD.com](https://JD.com), Meituan and Pinduoduo were hit by these waves, but their stock prices quickly rebounded (some unphased) after the fears were quickly wiped off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tencent](https://preview.redd.it/bf1ru4s3fbz51.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce0de9f7fee9e4a28168ceecd386a52aa7a81805)\n\n[Pinduoduo](https://preview.redd.it/lwuioff6fbz51.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5285f0d24ed79bdfa22e1ef1f01011f629647495)\n\n[JD.com](https://preview.redd.it/3xbrma7afbz51.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ea047a522bd1f8c7b241fd063e944c63d06dd11)\n\n[Meituan](https://preview.redd.it/tn29nfcujbz51.png?width=695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8484b390c60dd655c6c8013aaef21d52f3cb166e)\n\nMeituan\n\nWhile $BABA still seems to be a sinking ship after the news.\n\n[BABA](https://preview.redd.it/bs7xv52ifbz51.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6da96f6d51ff15a203318d9531c9d6748567afa6)\n\nGuys, $BABA at these levels is a steal. This is a monster of a company that only has great outlooks for the future. I personally believe that these monopolies laws might not come into fruition because it would be incredibly difficult to provision 1 supplier per platform rule with so many merchandisers out there. One may argue that even if it does get drafted, it just means a weaker barrier to entry, so more companies will be able to bring in new products to compete against the *better* brands; thus, increasing quality, competition and customer acquisition and retention. Regulation = bearish - doesn't always equate. \n\nSome more info about BABA for you value investors out there:\n\nBABA's PER = 28.02, EPS (TTM) = 9.31, 717.383B MC\n\nAMZN's PER = 91.48, EPS (TTM) = 34.20, 1.57T MC \n\nJD's PER = 626.39, EPS (TTM) = 0.15, 139.745B MC\n\nBABA is incredibly underpriced.\n\nAlso, I did mention this in the beginning, but what was it that I witnessed that made me enter this position? $BABA was red the entire day on Friday, bottomed at -2.5% then closed at -1.3%. It didn't see green even once. Despite that, their OTM option prices strangely rose by a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$BABA 02\\/19\\/21 calls](https://preview.redd.it/tbzgkzdvhbz51.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bf44529f02f8a57b9721286f9f754059a6699da)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$BABA 02\\/19\\/21 calls](https://preview.redd.it/jnp860kzhbz51.png?width=1201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3418dd587e086aace1cf4705064e8edb639eb3f1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$BABA 12\\/18\\/21 calls](https://preview.redd.it/4b8bi6z3ibz51.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b6d7ab3e3364c4d1591bd69db5209b6fefc3f7c)\n\nThe IVs on these average at around 65%, but currently they sit at 40%. Probably the near the bottom which signals for a great entry.\n\n[More bullish sentiments from option traders](https://preview.redd.it/pqll1o1eibz51.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=918d67c20138035e4f2f82b1547fa86885242d46)\n\nThe fear levels were extremely high on Friday, and China will keep their ears open for public's opinion until Nov 30, so it still might be a dangerous time to enter. But I just couldn't resist after seeing those types of option activities. Fear levels dying down over the weekend and JD's earnings report that's being released this coming Monday might also show a gap up starting Monday.\n\nDon't take this to be financial advice, but my forecast for $BABA is at least back to $310 levels before 02/19/20. You also have $BABA's earnings coming up in the 2nd week of Feb, so the IV will be insanely high this time to increase the value of your contracts even more.\n\n**Position: $BABA 290c 02/19/21**\n\n**Proof:** \n\n[$71k $BABA 290c 02\\/19\\/21](https://preview.redd.it/hj9xdmiklbz51.png?width=1514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d2883639e2712218664d0e3099ed57ddf15055e)",
