        "selftext": "This is brushing up against politics a bit, so we'll see if it survives mod attention.\n\nWith two recent high profile incidents of hedge funds becoming irresponsibly overleveraged in the market (Melvin Capital and Archegos) and causing market wide effects, it seems worth exploring the national security implications of continued poor oversight of institutional leverage in equities markets, and the potential economic effects. \n\nWith numerous countries with adversarial relationships to the US and NATO powers having a much more managed approach to their citizens business ventures and economic output, it is not far fetched to consider that overleveraging can become a tactic of economic warfare, and a way of winning or setting advantageous conditions for wars without firing a shot. \n\nChina is the classic and most probable candidate for this, so we'll start with them as an example. Consider their practice of internment and reeducation for Chinese leaders of businesses who become problematic for the state, such as Jack Ma with Alibaba. Consider also their fairly commonly known practice of leveraging western students and workers of Chinese descent in order to commit industrial espionage. From these two points, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where the CCP could engineer a domino crash through planned use of leveraging and defaults, either through a single action (apply pressure to an economic agent to both become overleveraged and then insolvent) or multistep (apply pressure to one or several agents to become over-leveraged, and then act seperately to cause a disruption in that area and subsequent defaults).\n\nThe utility of this sort of attack is twofold. It can be used to provide a distraction on demand, where unwanted attention on international affairs could be diverted by engineering a domestic economic crisis, compounded with social media campaigns. It could also be used as a prelude to military action, in order to attack a country's defense contracting and solvency for defense spending indirectly, while at the same time sowing internal strife to reduce the capability for a decisive and coherent response to provocation.\n\nThis type of attack would be difficult to predict and mitigate the effects of as either a retail or institutional investor, as it could be triggered with little to no warning from traditional indicators. Hedging against it would be tricky as well, but would most likely be found with plays on defense contractors such as $OSK, $BA, $LMT, ect. if the situation escalated to armed conflict. In this case, the saying \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" holds very true, as the best course of action would be addressing the use of leverage by institutional investors before a state actor uses it as an instrument of war. \n\nTLDR; Institutional leverage can and will be exploited at some point as a form of economic warfare by state actors, causing pre-planned recessions or economic crashes.",

        "selftext": "***TL;DR and also IMPORTANT: 3/19 is my short term play (I fudged the title, sorry). I'm doing put spreads, so my full positions (I'll update as I plan on getting in more):***  \n\n\n|Ticker|Expiration|Strike|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|$SPY|3/19|385p|\n|$SPY|4/1|370p|\n|$SPY|5/21|340p|\n|$SPY|6/18|250p|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere have been major crashes in my lifetime, because the \"American Dream\" died in the 90's. I'm assuming you smooth brains have at least heard of the ***Dotcom bubble***. Maybe you're a baby and are more familiar with the ***Housing Bubble***. Well let me tell you something: next up is the ***Unicorn Extinction*** bubble!!\n\nI love Unicorns, so much so that it's my last name and also the name of my business (totally serious) but this inevitable crash is as much a \"hypothesis\" as evolution is. But the markets seem to love and worship these billion dollar tech unicorns more than I do.\n\n*So here's the breakdown for you retards. I even used crayons and highlighters, and I'll outline it from top to bottom and spell it out to make it really easy for you to understand. Get your kool-aid and prepare to learn something.*\n\nWhat you're looking at below is ***$SPY*** which represents the S-and-P 500. Ooh letters and numbers!\n\nYou know that thing with numbers that you see on the TV sometimes? No, not the channel with the big yellow bird. You see it on that station at the bank that Mommy takes you to sometimes. It's called \"C-N-N\" and it's like REALLY boring, but you sit and drool with a dum-dum in your mouth (because that's what you are) and listen to them say things like \"The S and P is down 15 points today.\" It's a bunch of silly made up words, I know. But those numbers are the reason Mommy is crying and talking to Mr banker...\n\nHere, I'll illustrate it for you. I even used crayons and highlighters. We're going to look at the pretty picture from TOP to BOTTOM, okay?\n\nSo the lines underneath the actual stock price are moving averages (MA). They are the mean line of what a stock should be doing based upon its history. From warm colors (short term MA) to cool colors (long term MA) it's ***normal to see a bit of divergence***. However, the further apart these lines get, the more it's indicative of an ***over-valued market***, maybe so much so that it's going to be a free-fall as the bubble pops. The case I'm making for this Unicorn Extinction (*yes, I'm coining this term, and fucking some financial analyst better quote me when I'm right*) is the result of ***hyper-inflation*** (fed printers go BRRR), ***ridiculous speculation***, and ***over-valued businesses*** (mostly tech) yet again.\n\nThese moving averages have the highest divergence they've ever had!! That's not normal, and it means a price correction is coming, and it's going to be a fucking blood bath! The large green highlight is where the market SHOULD be, at least in my humble and moronic opinion.\n\nThe next box down is a Relative Strength Indicator (RSI). I won't get into the math, because 1+1=banana to you \ud83e\udd8d. Essentially \"traders\" (that's a big boy word) use this to know when a stock is over-bought or over-sold. Are you seeing a pattern on this screenshot?\n\nThe last box down, is harder to see, but this is your Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD). It essentially a mean of other Moving Average lines to indicate when a stock is going to switch directions. I'm zoomed out so far that you can't see all of the warnings, but I've circled them for you. These were the major signs that a crash was coming in the past.   You've been warned. Hope you are prepared for this next crash, and if you want to profit while others suffer (it's a bittersweet feeling) then you can do as I'm doing and short $SPY.\n\nAlso, fuck your \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc4b and \ud83d\ude80 because I already played that game. You go \ud83c\udf08\ud83e\uddf8 or get stung now bitches!! \ud83e\udd82\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wjki2qk35wk61.jpg?width=1621&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b42b773b26582117c18e6e6f6b76de4371d71406",

        "selftext": "Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  \n\nSure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like \"Stimulus Checks set to arrive...\"\n\nBut *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including\u2014but not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do\u2014if the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.\n\n**This one couldn\u2019t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. \n\n**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). \n\n**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week\u2019s losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn\u2019t I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. \n\n**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low\u2014there is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people\u2019s accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.\n\nBut anyway, **you didn\u2019t come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.\n\n***\n\n**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They\u2019re great!**\n\n**Last week\u2019s lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.\n\n**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though \ud83d\ude05 \n\n**Last week\u2019s lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it\u2019s okay to take a pause on the pick if it\u2019s hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**\n\n**\u201dNever lost, just ran out of time\u201d**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.\n\n***\n\n**Tier 1**: Dice I'm Rolling with this Week (intriguing whale bets, with RAMBO (non-ER pumps), sectors or tickers I like) *disclaimer: this may be choppy as week enter positions on dips, long dates*\n\n[MA](https://i.imgur.com/ufR3TrB.jpg) ([3/23 B of A electronic payments symposium](https://investor.mastercard.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))\n\nWhen I said playing it safe I guess I meant it lol.  MA is going from your grandfather's favorite holding to an interesting FinTech play that is showing malleability in a fast-paced industry.\n[They're doing cool stuff like this merger with Payoneer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/fintech-payoneer-partners-with-mastercard-ahead-of-3-billion-spac-.html) and, for better or worse, they've joined the growing list of companies linking their perceived fate to the commodity that shall not be mentioned.  \n\nI just generally like the stock, but I think this conference presentation will be a great catalyst as they have a chance to expose some of their new school thinking and get some nice quotes for FinTwit pumps.  Getting in early in case stimulus excitement waves can give a little push in banking and financial processors, but weary of entry because of FOMC.\n\n[NOK](https://i.imgur.com/EL3aSk8.jpg) ([Nokia Capital Markets Day 3/19](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news-and-events/events-calendar/investor-relations-events/capital-markets-day/))\n\n**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  \n\nSomeone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. \n\nSometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh \ud83d\ude2d ).\n\n[Somebody did a solid DD write-up on NOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m33vsq/full_diligence_post_on_nokia_nok_ahead_of_capital/) pre-event at r/investing.  I'm sure the sub will be appalled that I'm mining their shit for options speculation lol.\n\n[VXX](https://i.imgur.com/CdGUT8U.jpg) (FOMC March 16-18th discussing potential yield curve control, etc)\n\nThe intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I\u2019m going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.\n\n***\n\n**Tier 2**: Watching with great interest\n\n[AAPL](https://i.imgur.com/C40J4QR.jpg): [Rumored product launch event on 3/23](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indiatoday.in/amp/technology/news/story/apple-may-launch-airpods-3-ipad-pro-update-and-more-products-at-march-23-event-1777186-2021-03-09). Thanks /u/7thprincess \n\n[ABNB](https://i.imgur.com/XinYxt5.jpg): No rambo, but look at this crazy ass whale bet that came through with hilarious VOL/OI. People are betting on reopening, sure, but this feels welrd as hell and i love it. \n\n[CRSR](https://i.imgur.com/W0soBkU.jpg): No whale betting, but some other UOA and I am very intrigued by their event coming up on the 16th, **The Macquarie Consumer Bright Ideas Conference**.  Sounds pumpish, and they're trotting the CEO out.\n\n[GPRO](https://i.imgur.com/tdX3a7c.jpg): Tons of consistent whale betting matching performance of an uptrend.  Been on a tear, so may need a little dip to get a good entry point, but I want to follow the money on this one.\n\n[CS](https://i.imgur.com/5D7VBrd.jpg)/[DB](https://i.imgur.com/QnUyMK4.jpg): boring financials plays without UW bets, but still pumping nicely in other UOA registers.  CS has a conference presentation the morning of 3/16 and is releasing their annual report on 3/18. DB has a presentation on 3/18.\n\n****\n\nRemember, this week could be super flukey, so long dates, timing your entry, and the ability to HODL are key.  I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nThis week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.\n\n**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.\n\nInbox always open.  Happy hunting everybody.",

        "selftext": "So it's 2am and I'm a bit under the influence but I want to help some of the new traders and share some of my strategies and knowledge. This will probably be a jumbled mess as I'm more gonna wing it with no proper formatting, so sorry in advance. I'll try to atleast make them numbered to have some order.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1- Don't chase, there is literally a new play everyday with old plays resurfacing all the time on the down swing. If a stock has a 200 day ma of $3 you really don't want to be entering at 4;5. There will obviously be exceptions to the rule but they should be just that, exceptions. Let me give you a couple examples, SLNO is sitting at at $1.54 with it's 52 week low at $1.30 and 52 week high at $4.39. That is lined up well when considering risk and reward and the news is not that bad at all. Now let's look at a company like ENVB. This was a call I made earlier in the week and it's almost the same scenario, was riding lows on support and had bad news right before the market correction.I made the call at sub $2 and that ah it hit 5+ and now sits at $3.74. This is about their normal up range and no longer would I suggest it. Two companies in similar situations but one has played out and the other is set up perfectly. Note the differences and the build up with news and you'll see it in hindsight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2- If you set stop losses use them right, know your support lines and play them. If there is a large support wall at let's say $5 you would be silly to sell at $5.03. If you aren't using level 2 you need to be. The same goes for resistance, don't buy right below a wall. This is a simple practice but will help out a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Don't panic sell, if you are holding something that risky as to panic sell (given no awful news) you really made a bad decision on entry. Stop loss traps are very real and you will fall victim to this if you are shortsighted. There are ebbs and flows every day with the securities you hold and need to have an idea of you ins and outs before even thinking about investing. What you should be doing instead of panic selling is...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Average down, you believed in it enough to invest at a higher price ask yourself what's changed. You  should know where support is and also know what news or info is going around. Learn to accept you were a bit wrong on entry and bring it down. If you don't have enough capital to average down you've already made a mistake. You should always keep free capital for these exact situations. Averging down can make a loss less severe or even turn it green if done correctly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Don't buy options extremely OTM they will most likely lose, I'm sure someone here can say they've won a few but that's not how it usually goes. A good rule is never buy an option at a price you can't realistically reach by expiry. If you believe in it just spend the extra money to get an actual good option and don't treat the option market like a thrift store. I mean sure there is hidden treasure every once in a while but most is broken and smells like piss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6- Diversity is your friend,holding one or two securities with 90+% of your portfolio is extremely dangerous and can cost you big. A good rule is just hold 5-10+.This will help spread out the risk and keep you safer from catastrophic losses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. Research as much as you can, this sub is great but also be reading other forums and checking news and Sec filings. Screeners like [www.openinsider.com](https://www.openinsider.com) are great tools and you should be using everything you have at your disposal. I will or someone else (would be nice) can put together a list of the tools you can use and what they are used for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. Believe in yourself, if you've followed everything above and you are sure you've chosen right stick to your guns. Average down get in a prime spot if needed and enjoy when it goes knowing you made all the right moves to get there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9. Stay away from posts here that say \"Squeeze the shorts\" or \"easy x10\" these are the new eye candy words but don't mean shit. A short squeeze is just a pump with a fancy name if done by a group of discord/redditors with that exact intention going in. Trust news and charts and keep an ear toward public opinion, maybe introduce your ideas out in the world as well. A DD should include relevant new info and try to add a casual opinion without acting like a damn sales rep. Good companies sell themselves. Long DD doesn't equal good and a DD should be to inform not persuade.I don't care what Joe Blow thinks about it anyway tbh, I will formulate my opinion with the data provided.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10. I am only one man and moderate the sub the best I can with a great group around me which keeps my time here busy. That said I always try to respond and my messages are open. Feel free to drop a line and ask an opinion or run something by me. I am here to help and don't mind fielding newb questions or advanced ones. I would also consider senior traders to do the same with the new guys as everybody here being educated is in the best interest for anyone and the sub. The checks are coming soon so let's all work together to make the most of this new found bread.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all I have for you right now and depending the response I might work on a part two for everybody at a later date. If you made it this far thanks for reading and I hope it helps in some manner. I will be checking back if there are any specific questions you would like to ask just drop them in the comments.",

So spare 15 minutes of your time to learn to use TA like the professionals managing billions in Wallstreet.\n\nThis post is a follow up on my guide on how to buy puts for  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b  here\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfl6zt/goldman\\_sachs\\_made\\_money\\_liquidating\\_their\\_prime/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfl6zt/goldman_sachs_made_money_liquidating_their_prime/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My trading journal from Friday 3/26**\n\n**MORNING 07:00-12:00**\n\nFirst thing we need to do is to setup our charting tools, I would recommend Tradingview for their free yet powerful charting tools having thousands of community supplied indicators.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9e536ycn06q61.jpg?width=1673&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d0e4d631c33ccd0baf71e6db44a754f7b70a8cd\n\nNext we need to open our trading chat group, to get synced with the general pulse of the market, though not as important as TA , it's at least useful so that we don't feel as lonely during trading.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q3zpnefo06q61.jpg?width=445&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105c93ad369eb22f1fc9a3dda9fae387ddece542\n\nWhoops, Michael is yapping about some personal matters, something about a block sale at his neighborhood. He was this preppy kid I know from high school, he moved to NY to work for some rich dude named Goldman. He said he works as a prime broker, I think that means he's flipping apartments in NY. I'm gonna pm him privately to remind him not to post personal stuff in the group. I  open up my dashboards, and see that there's not much going on. This is very important for beginners, you don't have to be in the market all the time, look for a high probability play before you open a position. Let's just wait patiently until the technicals tells us to enter.\n\n**MIDDAY 12:00-15:00**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88priavp06q61.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ffa27aa5b2950f90bbd91369ff900b002465bf0\n\nMichael spamming the group again with his nonsense, I'm just going to ignore him and open a chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0hy7nat06q61.jpg?width=1641&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1870c9155e18f2b195b5be6d9073fec3237f46e0\n\nUsing my favorite indicators of support/resistance, MACD, VWAP and MA cross we can see that this is a clear indicator for a downward move in VIAC according to the technicals, I open a short position here.\n\n2 hours later...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pc771x6u06q61.jpg?width=1643&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a78ccd799c49944de9ec2e02960e800253fb79c7\n\nlook at that, the TA predicted the exact moment VIAC will drop. Let's close this here, take our tendies and chill while we wait for another play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AFTERNOON  15:00-16:00**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oaq044xy06q61.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f03aa90bb5daf00d99b911f88c697c34430c1aa\n\nFor those that don't know, MOC stands for masculine of center, meaning lesbian/trans people that are masculine in nature. Michael is considering a sex change operation and it looks like he has just announced a mysterious donor that is about to make a big donation to his \ud83c\udf46 chopping support group. This is not related to trading in anyway, but it's kinda fun hearing about Michael progressive activism. As markets are about to close, lets look at the chart again, this time let's pull up the SPY\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3hha25f016q61.jpg?width=1632&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a44d401e72b863c90fff719775e7bfd60019acc0\n\nYep definitely we can see an upward movement potential here with the RSI  going up over the purple area and resistance being tested, let's go long here into the close\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5l5m3j116q61.jpg?width=1640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c866e21ff30b2bb117e09df144a5ca82089af1cf\n\nAnd like clockwork, It rocketed up, man look at it go. TA absolutely nailed it once again.\n\nAs Ken Griffith once said, advances in technology have enabled real time information and advanced charting techniques to be available to the retail investor, levelling the playing field with institutions.  You just need some crayons and join Goldman's prime brokerage chat group, which absolutely anybody can do right ?\n\n**Remember, if you can't trade profitably using TA. you have to be either lazy or stupid or probably both** \n\nTune in next week where we will be reviewing the differences between a Crayola and a Wonder Stix and how each will effect your trading style.\n\n*\\*Chat screens taken from Tyler Durden phone*",

All movements of securities are made to the participant\u2019s account electronically with book-entry adjustments.* If an issuer is not DTC eligible, then its shares cannot be transferred between brokerage accounts electronically, which basically means its shares cannot be traded easily. **Major Exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ require DTC eligibility.**\n\n[https://mrscorp.com/mission-ready-commences-trading-on-the-otcqb-venture-market/](https://mrscorp.com/mission-ready-commences-trading-on-the-otcqb-venture-market/)\n\n# 7- PPE stockpiles might be resplenished with the 1.9m stimulus\n\n**Disaster relief**: The bill has in it $50 billion for reimbursing state, local, tribal, and territorial governments for their Covid-19 response expenses, including vaccinations, PPE, National Guard deployment, and disinfecting public facilities.\n\n**Other public health investments:** The proposal puts $7.6 billion into community health centers for coronavirus-related activities and $1.8 billion toward HHS for coronavirus tests, PPE, and vaccines for staff and people living in congregate settings.

For manufacturers, the government could pay them to build production lines and keep workers employed, and when there\u2019s a crisis, it could activate a contract clause to shift production into high gear. This would be a smarter approach than spending billions of dollars to stock away supplies, Kadlec say For one thing, traditional stockpiling has logistical limits. **If the national stockpile were to hold enough N95 masks for the 1918 influenza pandemic, adjusted for today\u2019s population, it would have 3.5 billion, which would \u201cfill up every warehouse in the U.S.,\u201d** says Greg Burel, who was director of the stockpile from 2007 to January 2020.  \n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/the-future-of-u-s-national-stockpile-isn-t-a-bigger-stockpile](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/the-future-of-u-s-national-stockpile-isn-t-a-bigger-stockpile)\n\nWe\u2019ve known for many years that much of what would be considered \u201cbasic\u201d manufacturing competency and capability has moved outside of the U.S. While we\u2019re a global and integrated ecosystem, we\u2019re also one in which \u201clowest total cost\u201d has meant the erosion of local options. American businesses and consumers simply will not pay a lot more for a locally produced item than for an imported product. Those frustrated with scarcity, but unaware of what goes into developing an end-to-end supply-chain map of gowns, goggles, gloves, masks or wipes, are horrified to find the dearth of options we now have, or that the majority of relevant manufacturing left years if not decades ago.\n\nMany have said that PPE demand will drop precipitously, or that returning manufacturing capability to the U.S. is a fool\u2019s errand. I believe both statements to be untrue.\n\n**Demand Will Rise**\n\nPPE was a large industry prior to COVID-19. In 2019, research showed that companies that required key protective materials (such as headwear, eyewear and apparel) for manufacturing, technology, healthcare and other industries made up $8 billion in global revenue. COVID-19-related PPE demand has now more than doubled in the U.S., and our economy has yet to fully reopen. Our projections show that with a gradual reopening of businesses, the economy will provide a strong and consistent counterbalance to the welcomed impact of a reduced pace of disease transmission throughout 2021 and beyond.  \n[https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/32667-ppe-is-here-to-stay-and-thats-not-bad](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/32667-ppe-is-here-to-stay-and-thats-not-bad)\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/isolation-gowns.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/isolation-gowns.html)\n\n**TLDR: THE CEO IS BUCK AND HE FUCKS**,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Buck Marshall](https://preview.redd.it/i31at2y8x2n61.png?width=128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67e67e21b4c905546fe591af492899e4dcc0c749)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*he bought 60$k at .54USD two weeks ago so I dont think he will be bag holding in the .50s for long, let him and the other insiders buys convince you to do your own DD on MSNVF.*  \nAgain 90m Market cap for more than one hundred millions of dollars in delivered contracts since september 2020.\n\nDISCLAIMER: *I'm long this stock since a few months with a decent number of shares.

        "selftext": "*Join me on this rocket ship named QFIN.*  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nI have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I\u2019ve got good news for all ape-kind: I\u2019ve found one. Here\u2019s my DD (whatever that means). \n\nTicker: **QFIN**, AKA \"360 Digitech\". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. \n\n**Here's their business model:**\n\n*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.\n\n*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) \n\n*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. \n\n*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.\n\nThe business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.\n\n**But first, let\u2019s talk numbers.** 2017 Revenue: *175 million* 2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* 2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* TTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months)\n\nObviously that\u2019s insane growth. Most apes can\u2019t even count that high. \n\nAnd yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That\u2019s less than half the P/E of the S&amp;P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.** \n\nTo understand why the stock is still so cheap, let\u2019s talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it. \n\nFirstly, I assume most of you haven\u2019t bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit \u2013 it\u2019s next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low\u2026. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what\u2019s caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.\n\nThis is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn\u2019t that there\u2019s extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the \u201cproblems\u201d are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood\u2026 so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. \n\n**First Reason for Doubt \u2013 Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. \n\nOne regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*\n\n**Why it doesn\u2019t matter:** According to QFIN\u2019s CEO, Wu \u201cCock Slapper\u201d Haisheng, *\u201cCurrently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.\u201d* \n\nAnother new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem \u2013 QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. \n\n**Second Reason for Doubt \u2013 Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China\u2019s economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.\n\n**Why it doesn\u2019t matter:** First of all, *sack up.* \n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn\u2019t a bank. *(Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.)* Remember their business model I mentioned earlier? \n\n*Now consider this:* \n\nRemember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. *(600mm interest expense).* Meanwhile, **they\u2019re receiving 8 billion in service revenue**. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN)) They\u2019re bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they\u2019re bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren\u2019t a bank. What\u2019s even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN\u2019s loans defaults to FINV\u2019s, who shot up *90%* yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f](https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f) \n\nIf you\u2019re too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN\u2019s historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower. \n\nAnother facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, \u201cTotal operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency\u201d \u2013 CFO Alex \u201cOh God Please No Not My Face\u201d Xu \n\n**Third Reason for Doubt \u2013 uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs**\n\nOK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It\u2019s also the most nebulous. \n\nA few things to think about: \n\nThis is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I\u2019m not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird. \n\nSpeaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. *In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are.* Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN\u2019s loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving*. QFIN did the opposite \u2013 they devalued the loans by too much* (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). \u201c...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.\u201d \u2013 Ethan \u201cProlapse King\u201d Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued.\n\n**What risks are there still?**\n\nFirst and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk. Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like, for now, that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators seemed to have a hard on for fucking up Ant Group \u2013 a spinoff of Alibaba. Jack \u201cActual Vampire\u201d Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations after disappearing the guy for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN\u2019s stock, as another Chinese Fintech company, got dragged down by the bears despite not really being affected. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie\u2019s red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting.\n\n**Any big banana showers coming soon?** YES! **Earnings call on 3/15!** QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it\u2019ll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet. \n\nIf you still aren\u2019t convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon. \n\nTLDR: I like the stock. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\n*This is obviously not financial advice.*\n\n*Positions: long 15 QFIN 3/19 calls 35 strike, and long 500 shares (cost basis $27.48)*\n\nEDIT: had to remove my source for the conference call quotes since it was SA and blocking posting.

        "selftext": "Short term the market is unpredictable, and very long term also becomes increasingly difficult to prevede what will happen, because of the cumulative effect of future new events.\n\nSo what do you think are the best bets today, considering both potential upside and risk, if you hope to see a profit or simply are willing to completely change your portfolio composition within a couple years?\n\nI\u2019m long on the aerospace industry, with Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus and Rolls Royce. They have been beaten up because of the pandemic but I assume they will recover nicely within the time. They can be volatile though.\n\nLong Visa and MasterCard, as the move to cashless payments is surely a continuing trend.\nI see a couple risks here. One is disruption by other companies. Consumer facing brands with a large user base, especially Apple Amazon and Google, have already stepped in the field and could eventually try to create their own payment networks. Then there is possible government disruption, with the move to digital currency, that could affect their margins.\n\nGetting more speculative, PayPal is tempting because it had such a great run and then a pullback, but seems also a lot more risk, both comparatively overvalued and easier to replace.\n\nTravel recovery looks also like a safe bet, Delta United Hilton Marriot are some interesting names, Airbnb even, but I\u2019d be interested in finding good alternatives.\n\nE-commerce, Amazon MercadoLibre and Alibaba are at the moment in widely different situations, but on the whole I suspect they will do well in a couple years.\nMELI is a growth stock, which is toxic these days, but appears it may honestly grow. BABA is undervalued because China, but I\u2019m confident Jack Ma and the government will find a middle ground as they have largely common interests.\n\nStill the relations between China and much of the rest of the world are rapidly deteriorating, something I\u2019m very concerned about, but the greatest worry is that the effect could spill well beyond Chinese stocks.\n\nShorting a bunch of EV and Green energy names is a temptation, but handling the volatility would require a huge margin and the risk high. Meh.\n\nPSTH is a tempting speculative play, mostly because of the name of Ackman, since it\u2019s back close to the initial offering price. Even though SPACs are fast falling out of favor, this one has been widely publicized and could see a nice bump of a merger is announced.\n\nYour thought on the above and other ideas?",

Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\n\\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing.

It\u2019s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, **trustworthiness and accountability must be established**. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you\u2019re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img shluc14va1n61...*\n\nJust take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The KYC Solution](https://preview.redd.it/2oueufhxb1n61.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b3d6e4bb85aa337ed3a0f581929b4d8c2e70eed)\n\nIt is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Black American Enterprise](https://preview.redd.it/xbdw0cnxa1n61.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e45ab15c55d54201f82e349bb86594c74cb68c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ss98jxya1n61.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500ac4256347d8810ac273321f726ad42e466696\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxtz1n00b1n61.png?width=1772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd766d326a1d46368526d32f4701c209ca90397c\n\n# The Underbanked\n\nJack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The playbook](https://preview.redd.it/1eiwe2j1b1n61.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f81927188476f40d136d884d18be7a5cb172ef49)\n\nInterestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.\n\nIn my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:\n\n\\- Cash App\u2019s Twitter and advertising strategy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Urban strategy](https://preview.redd.it/c4gc0lvfb1n61.png?width=1487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2b69447ee9c822aef198c97fcb83d7c992b886b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Youth strategy](https://preview.redd.it/dyhd7ssgb1n61.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd5780a188b29e1a930b5d85cdd0272e01844a65)\n\n\\- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching \u201cCash App vs. Venmo\u201d. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Underbanking strategy](https://preview.redd.it/xruw28aib1n61.png?width=2949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c21fefe36277359c1d37adfa86b592d009af52)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square\u2019s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You\u2019ve heard it before, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?\u201d. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:\n\n1. The ability to start a business\n2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks\n3. The ability to invest and educate in B\\*tcoin\n4. The ability to save on basic purchases\n5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Reality](https://preview.redd.it/hb2b2zljb1n61.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa1cce454480fe56d30489feeae3a52809dc559)\n\nWhat this inevitably means is that we probably won\u2019t even see Square operating at \u201cfull-force\u201d until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.\n\n# Speculation\n\nThis is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:\n\n1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank\u2019s regulatory offerings.\n2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.\n3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.\n4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.\n5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.\n6. Square will foray into equal housing.\n7. Square will improved loan systems.\n8. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease follow for more content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg)",

Even with the 10 year treasury note up more than 7% on Friday, tech held its own. Maybe we are starting to see most of the fear surrounding the rising yields being priced in.

        "selftext": "CPNG is a South Korean E-commerce company, dubbed, the \"Amazon of Korea\". Bill Ackman said CPNG is one of the best investments he's ever made. Upon closer look, it's very quite clear why he would say that.\n\nUnlike Amazon, CPNG offers free same-day delivery without limiting their available inventory. CPNG has their own private fleet of delivery drivers and fulfillment centers and thus has insane amount of flexibility and control over how they deliver and ship items. Not only that, they are like DASH in that they deliver food and drinks from local vendors.\n\nTheir unique \"Dawn Delivery\" service allows users to make orders at night and receive items early next morning. Returns can be processed instantaneously with money refunded as soon as the item is scanned. It's no wonder in such a short amount of time, CPNG has dominated the South Korean E-commerce Market.  \n\n\n**Contention 1: But South Korea is small!**  \n\\-South Korea is the 5th largest e-commerce market in the world and is projected to be the 3rd largest E-commerce market after China and the US in the next 5-10 years.\n\n\\-They\u2019re quiet about expansion plans, but they have offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Silicon Valley, and Seattle.\n\n\\-Also, South Korea is like the Switzerland of Asia. Due to Korea\u2019s relatively neutral political history, many Asian countries don\u2019t have any qualms working with Korea vs. say China or Japan. It's why Samsung, K-pop, BTS etc. have penetrated the global market post-2010s in ways that Chinese and Japanese companies haven\u2019t. In short, a Korean company nowadays has much greater potential reaching South East Asia and the West than China or Japan.  \n\n\n**Notable Investors:**  \n\\-Bill Ackman, Softbank, Blackrock, Sequoia Capital, and more.  \n\n\n**Intangibles:**  \n\\-A charismatic CEO boosts sentiment. I bought Alibaba at 90 purely on Jack Ma\u2019s charisma. I bought TSLA at 260 (sold too early) purely because of Elon Musk.\n\n\\-CPNG\u2019s CEO, Bom Kim, is the most articulate, and innovative CEO I\u2019ve ever seen to come out of South Korea since ever. This guy is cut above\u2014this guy will say he \u201ccares first about his customers\u201d and mean it, but deep down inside, he wants investors to make a lot of money. I know it when I see them. People like Musk, Ma, Jensen Huang, Brian Chesky, and now, this guy.\n\n\\-Bom Kim is Korean born, but grew up in the US. He dropped out of Harvard after just 6-months (As a Korean, you have to be a psycho or really believe in your company to do that). Bom interned at BCG, then started a magazine company before started Coupang around 2010.\n\n\\-Kim\u2019s motto: I envision a world where people will say, \u201cHow could I have ever lived without Coupang\u201d.\n\n  \n**Contention 2: Growth stocks are out of favor in a high interest rate environment!**  \n\\-Possibly a bigger problem. As per many pundits on CNBC and Bloomberg, the growth potential of CPNG specifically will depend heavily on earnings. With the talented CEO and revenue beat year after year, I believe CPNG will make it.  \n\n\n**TLDR** \\- CPNG is the best Korean E-commerce company that has its own robust infrastructure and an articulate CEO that plans to grow its operations significantly in the next year.\n\n**Strat:** I'm buying lots of hundreds of shares to sell covered calls, which will have very high premiums when the options market opens. I did this with PLTR and ABNB.",

        "selftext": "After a steep pullback in the last couple of weeks, stocks roared back Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq recording its best day since April 2020. The move marked a stark reversal after the index sank into a correction by the close of Monday's session, plunging a total of more than 10% from a recent record closing high. Goes to show how volatile the market can be. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.42% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.10% up.\n\nThe sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant\u2019s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. \n\nThe Treasury yield pulled back a little but remains at elevated levels, which was pressuring equity markets, particularly tech stocks, in recent weeks. . Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. \n\nCourtney Dominguez, Payne Capital Management Senior Wealth Advisor said, \u201cThis is a trend that tends to happen as we get out of a recession: You tend to see stocks move towards cyclical. So things like value companies or small caps, things like energy, tend to do really well when you\u2019re coming out of a recession. And what happened last year is, those tech companies were really doing so well that their prices were getting extremely high. I don\u2019t think these companies are going away. I think a lot of these are going to be things that we continue to have in our workplaces going forward. But the question is, are these companies so expensive, is all the optimism already priced in?\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden\u2019s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Gamestop (GME) performed strongly again today, rising around 25% at the time of writing.\n* Roblox is set to go public tomorrow via direct listing, ticker will be RBLX. Unlike a traditional IPO the company isn\u2019t raising new capital via the offering, instead holders are selling stock they already own.\n* Walt Disney Co.'s flagship streaming service, Disney+, has surpassed 100 million subscribers in its first 16 months of operation, the company announced today.\n* After cratering in value in recent weeks, EV stocks like NIO and Tesla (TSLA) came roaring back today! It was Tesla\u2019s best day since 2013, up around 19% at the time of writing\n* Twitter (TWTR) and Square (SQ) boss Jack Dorsey said on Tuesday he will convert proceeds from the digital auction of the first-ever tweet on the platform to bitcoin for charity. His first tweet sold as a non-fungible token for $2.5 million\n* **Please note current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes.**\n* Ambarella (AMBA) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target around $135 at Buy. Stock currently around $106\n* Clean Harbors (CLH) target raised by Needham &amp; Co from $104 to $107 at Buy.

Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not risk, but it is an opportunity. Where else do you look for cheap stocks?\" - Li Lu (Had to reuse the quote, so valuable considering how stocks rallied today)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, March 2, 2021**\n\nStocks retreated on Tuesday, pulling back after rallying yesterday, underscoring how volatile the market is right now. Market participants continue to focus on the Treasury yields, a new coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and additional stimulus from Washington. \n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we\u2019ll have a robust and ultimately complete \\[economic\\] recovery.\u201d Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell\u2019s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March. \n\nIn Washington D.C., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate is scheduled to begin debating the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that the House of Representatives recently passed this week, though he did not specify when a vote would be held. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Rocket Mortgage (RKT) soared over 70% today, sending the stock to record highs and continuing a dizzying rally in the last few days. Shares were even halted at one point today. In a note to clients, S3 Analytics said, \u201cRKT\u2019s stock price and short selling activity is reminiscent of another recent high flying meme stock \u2013 GameStop Inc (GME). Both stocks saw their share price spike due to high retail buying interest (predominantly due to significant social media activity) and an options based gamma squeeze. Both stocks also had/have relatively high short interest and high stock borrow rates which imply strong short-selling demand and limited stock borrow supply.\"\n* After posting strong earnings and rising more than 8% after-hours yesterday, Zoom\u2019s (ZM) stock price cratered today, with the stock going from 8% up to more than 9% down in today\u2019s session.\n* After posting disappointing earnings, NIO\u2019s stock also cratered today, falling more than 12% in today\u2019s session.\n* After the recent controversies, Alibaba (BABA) co-founder Jack MA is now the fourth richest person in China, falling from first place. \n* In a memo to employees, Ant Group\u2019s executive chairman Eric Jing said an IPO was still in the cards.\n* Vizio Holdings, a maker of smart TVs, has filed for an IPO. The company has sold 82.2 million televisions and 11.8 million sound bars since its founding in 2002, the prospectus said.\n* \\***Please note current stock prices were written in the morning pre-market and do not reflect intraday volatility.**\n* C3 AI (AI) target raised by Needham &amp; Co from $193 to $195 at Buy.

        "selftext": "**TL;DR TA looks good for a reasonable move up, if volume continues to increase then there is the possibility of a larger breakout.**\n\nI jumped in on ASRT at 90 cents, I present here my TA on the stock and my price targets for the coming weeks.\n\nFrom both an RSI 14 and MFI perspective ASRT shows potential to continue a move upwards at least in the short term. Both sit around the middle of the park just over 50. This is good news as it suggests to me that when looking at the bollinger bands that a cross of the 20 day MA is likely and movement towards the upper band. With any good news from the conference I am putting this as highly likely. Th\n\nThere is a clear downtrend formed but with a noticeable increase in buyer volume I think there is a reasonable chance of breaking this and setting the next major resistance as the recent high (118). Of course the recent golden cross may also trigger TA buyers which I think is good news in moving this stock up in the short-medium term. After this the challenge would be the greater medium term high at 145, a decrease in buying volume here would suggest a drop back to current  levels but a break of this resistance on strong volume could signal a rocket ship.\n\nGood news from the conference would likely not only cause a news surge in the SP but make the TA very attractive as chances of a major breakout would increase massively. The company will be looking to stabilise the price above $1 for the purpose of the NASDAQ listing which gives me a feeling that they will act to encourage this.\n\nSubstantial support can be found at the recent low. A wedge could potentially be forming but is  uncertain on the upward trending line.\n\nMy price targets for the stock are (depending on volume at each given point):\n\n**PT 1 $118**\n\n**PT 2 $140**\n\n**PT 3 $360**\n\nThis is not financial advice and should not be taken as such.\n\n[Resistances, 20 Bollinger bands and down trend marked](https://preview.redd.it/qbozdf5b63n61.png?width=1589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=680bfce3db07d3f0c33520b36649233949044bef)",

        "selftext": "Armed with a fresh round of stimulus checks, Americans may be ready to shop...for some bitcoin and stocks.\n\nA new survey out of Mizuho Securities on Monday estimates that 10%, or nearly $40 billion of the $380 billion in direct stimulus checks, may be used to purchase bitcoin and stocks. Mizuho managing director Dan Dolev and his team surveyed approximately 235 individuals with less than $150,000 of household income. Of that, about 200 said they expect to receive the third round of direct stimulus payments in the coming days.\n\nNearly 2-in-5 check recipients expect to use some portion of their checks to invest. And stimulus check recipients prefer bitcoin over stocks, according to the survey.\n\n\"The survey predicts that bitcoin will account for 60% of total incremental investment spend. We calculate it could add as much as 2-3% to bitcoin's current $1.1t trillion market value,\" Dolev writes.\n\nDolev says stocks from his coverage universe that should benefit the most from people buying equities with their checks include Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and Square.\n\nMizuho isn't alone in its call on the use of stimulus checks.\n\nA good chunk of the new stimulus money about to be funneled into American households shortly via the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill may find its way into the stock market, Goldman Sachs says.\n\n\"We expect households will be the largest source of equity demand this year,\" Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote recently. \"We raise our household net equity demand forecast to $350 billion from $100 billion, which reflects faster economic growth and higher interest rates than we had assumed previously, additional stimulus payments to individuals, and increased retail activity in early 2021.\n\nThe latest round of stimulus checks will be sizable, hence Wall Streeters optimism some of the funds will find their way into asset classes such as bitcoin and stocks.\n\nRoughly 90% of American households will be eligible for stimulus checks, according to CNN. For those eligible, they stand to receive a $1,400 check. Considering dependents are included, a couple with two children could receive up to $5,600.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html?guccounter=1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nearly-10-of-the-380-billion-in-stimulus-checks-may-be-used-to-buy-bitcoin-and-stocks-survey-131009531.html?guccounter=1)",

        "selftext": "iQSTEL is a telecommunications and tech company that has a very solid portfolio of clients in the US and internationally. Within the US, their clients include Verizon, T-Mobile, Bell, &amp; IBM. Some of their prominent international clients include Movistar, Vodafone, and Tata Motors (my understanding is they are the Tesla of India, but don't take my word for it).\n\nIn addition to telecommunications services they also provide technology services for IoT, Electric Vehicle Batteries (started making them for ALYI), financial services and blockchain.\n\nIQST is planning on uplisting to NASDAQ and have made some solid moves to make that come true. They recently converted 21 Million shares Series B preferred shares, reducing the float to approximately 60 million shares. They also announced on February 17, that they are debt free.\n\nHere's where things get interesting\n\nLooking at their financials, they are losing money on the bottom line every year, which is pretty common for a tech company, however, their revenue has grown YoY since they first started posting financials in 2017 and they reported 288% growth in revenues last year. Revenues in 2020 were $44 million and they announced yesterday that they are on track to meet their projection of $60.5 million in revenue.\n\nThis means that at the current share price and share structure, their market cap is below their 2021 projections for revenue AND they also announced yesterday that they are anticipating increasing their revenue projections by the end of Q2 through consolidation of their subsidiaries into one entity and through M&amp;A.\n\nAdditionally, they are currently working on beginning field testing a IoT communication platform for the chemical industry and signed an LOI with a prominent Fortune 500 company within the global chemical industry. That company has yet to be announced and the field testing is set to begin in April 2021.

        "selftext": "Stocks rallied on Monday after a choppy day, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) closing at new record levels. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered some lost ground as market participants continue to balance optimism regarding economic growth against rising Treasury yields.\n\nLast week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.\n\nWashington\u2019s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to hover near one-year highs at 1.607%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, \u201cThe pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.\u201d \n\nRising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital in order to fuel their growth and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. \n\nSeveral countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca\u2019s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union\u2019s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.\n\nIn other news, Novavax (NVAX) recently announced [drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK showed the inoculation was 96.4% effective ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0)against the original strain of the coronavirus. Analyses also showed the vaccine was 86.3% effective against the variant of the coronavirus circulating in the UK, and 55.4% effective against the variant circulating in South Africa.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* General Electric\u2019s (GE) stock rallied more than 5% today after its worst week in around a year.\n* Volkswagen (VWAGY) plans to build half a dozen battery cell plants in Europe by 2030 to expand infrastructure for charging electric vehicles. \n* Tesla Inc. said Chief Executive Elon Musk has changed his title at the company to \"Technoking of Tesla,\" and Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn will have the title of \"Master of Coin.\" \n* The Chinese government wants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to sell some of its media assets, including the South China Morning Post, because of growing concerns about the technology giant\u2019s influence over public opinion in the country, according to Bloomberg who is citing a person familiar with the matter.\n* AMC finally gets to reopen in Los Angeles on Monday after nearly a year of shutdowns because of the pandemic.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price is written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes.\\*\\***\n* Adient (ADNT) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "Below you'll find my DD on Kinross Gold Corporation, a primarily gold mining company based out of Canada. I have made this a neutral DD where you can draw your own conclusions based on the information provided. You'll see a list of bearish arguments and bullish arguments. In addition, I've benchmarked KGC against their largest gold mining competitor - Newmont Corporation (NEM). I hope you'll find this useful. So let's dive in...\n\n# Basics\n\n**Company:** Kinross Gold Corporation\n\n**HQ:** Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\n**Industry:** Gold and silver mining\n\n**Exchange:** NYSE\n\n**Ticker:** KGC vs. NEM (Newmont Corporation)\n\n**Price:** $6.39 vs. $56.14 \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**Market Cap:** 7.95B vs. 44.29B \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**Avg Trading Volume:** 19.5M vs. 6.24M \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**Short % of Shares Outstanding:** 1.19% vs. 1.00% \\[3\\]\\[4\\]\n\n**Institutional Shares:** 67.4% vs. 84.11% \\[3\\]\\[4\\]\n\n**12 Month Price Change:** 56.6% vs. -5.8% \\[5\\]\\[6\\]\n\n**PE Ratio:** 5.99 vs. 15.76 \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\n\n**P/B Ratio:** 1.22 vs. 1.96 \\[7\\]\\[8\\]\n\n**P/S Ratio:** 1.93 vs. 3.95 \\[9\\]\\[10\\]\n\n**3 Year Net Income Growth:** 5788.14% vs. 729.61% \\[11\\]\\[12\\]\n\n**Projected Revenue:** $4.6B vs. $13.5B \\[13\\]\\[14\\]\n\n**Debt to Equity Ratio:** 0.29 vs. 0.26 \\[15\\]\\[16\\]\n\n**Industry Average Debt to Equity Ratio:** 0.01 \\[17\\]\n\n**ESG Risk Rating:** 30.5 vs. 25.5 \\[18\\]\\[19\\]\n\n## Bearish Arguments\n\n**Head to Head:**\n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 0.19% in short % of shares outstanding.\u00a0\n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 16.71% in shares held by institutions.\n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 0.03 in debt to equity ratio.\u00a0\n\n\\- NEM beats KGC by 5 in ESG risk rating\n\n**Company/Stock:**\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's debt to equity ratio is significantly higher than the metal mining industry's average debt to equity ratio. This could be explained by the sharp increase in production (linked to gold prices appreciating) and choosing to take on debt to finance operations \\[15\\]\\[17\\]\\[20\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's share price has dropped 29.5% in the last 6 months \\[5\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold performs very poorly among its competitors for its carbon footprint \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold performs poorly among its competitors for its water conservation \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Share price is below 20 and 200 MA (bearish signal for some, bullish for others).\n\n**Market:**\n\n\\- Gold price decreased by 10% in the past 6 months and 5% in the past 30 days \\[20\\].\n\n\\- In 2020, global gold production fell by 5.2%. In 2019, global gold production fell by 1% (first time since 2008) \\[24\\].\n\n\\- *\"Based on known reserves, estimates suggest that gold mining could reach the point of being economically unsustainable by 2050, though new vein discoveries will likely push that date back somewhat.\" \"...It is unlikely that large-scale gold mining will continue past 2075 without either huge mining technology advances or the discovery of currently unknown massive gold deposits\"* \\[22\\].\n\n\\- *\"Gold mining can significantly alter the natural environment. For example, gold mining activities in tropical forests are increasingly causing deforestation along rivers and in remote areas rich in biodiversity.\"*\u00a0 \\[23\\].\n\n## Bullish Arguments\n\n**Head to Head:**\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 62.4% in 12 month price change.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 9.77 in PE ratio.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 0.74 in P/B ratio.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 2.02 in P/S ratio.\n\n\\- KGC beats NEM by 5,058.5% in 3 year net income growth.\n\n**Company/Stock:**\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's projected revenue of $4.6B for 2021 is 2.4x higher than current total debt of $4.2B and has the potential to decrease the company's debt to equity ratio, moving it closer to the industry's average \\[13\\]\\[15\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold has seen significant gains in net income in the past 3 years, growing by 5788.14% \\[11\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's share price has grown 56.6% in the last 12 months \\[5\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's stock has a low short % of shares (1.19%) outstanding with a high % of shares held by institutional investors (67.4%) \\[3\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold announced in September 2020 that the dividend would be reinstated. Management has displayed confidence in the near- to mid-term by restarted dividend payments. Based on current production projections, the payments are expected to continue until 2023 \\[25\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold's updates on development projects, exploration and mineral reserves, and resources show successful signs of progress with no delays. The company reported extensions of mine life at several sites as well as an expansion of mineral reserves \\[27\\].\u00a0\n\n\\- Kinross Gold has an EPS growth of 44%, compound, over the last three years \\[28\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold is JP Morgan's \u2018top pick in the gold sector,\u2019 rated as Overweight (i.e., a Buy) \\[29\\].\u00a0\n\n\\- Kinross Gold has beaten analysts earning estimates the last 4 quarters \\[30\\].\n\n\\- Average analyst recommendation rating is a Buy with an average analyst price target at $12,08 \\[13\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold is a top performer among its competitors for its pollution prevention, workplace health and safety, and diversity of corporate leadership \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold performs well among its competitors for its employee satisfaction and pay and corporate governance \\[21\\].\n\n\\- Kinross Gold has shared new plans and renewed commitment to decrease carbon footprint and water conservation \\[31\\]\\[32\\]\u00a0\n\n**Market:**\n\n\\- Investing in a growing gold company can act as leverage to the price of gold. When gold appreciates, gold mining companies can increase their production and grow revenues. The price of gold has increased substantially by 561% over the past 20 years, 36% in the past 5 years, and 5.8% in the last 12 months. This has provided smaller mining companies like Kinross with the leverage they need to grow their sales \\[11\\]\\[20\\].\n\n\\- There's a general weak US dollar outlook, especially once COVID worries subside. Gold is a good hedge against inflation when the value of the dollar falls \\[33\\].\n\n\\- 7.5% of worldwide demand for gold comes from the consumer technology industry. As the industry grows, demand for gold will grow with it, driving up the price. Consumer technology is projected to generate $2.06 trillion in 2023, compared to $1.69 trillion in 2019 \\[34\\]\\[35\\].\n\n\\- Gold is widely regarded as a good hedge against economic turbulence and uncertainty, and is therefore considered a recession-proof investment.\n\n\\- Global gold production is expected to grow by 5.5% in 2021 \\[36\\].\n\n## Sources\n\n\\[1\\]

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MicroVision: $150 stock when acquired for $20 Billion?**\n\nI can\u2019t tell you what people expect from the 4th Qtr CC, but I wouldn't look for an announcement that the company was sold. I wouldn\u2019t look for an announcement that someone took an equity stake. I wouldn't look for an announcement that Lidar A-Sample is already done. In my opinion these are not realistic expectations and may not happen at the 4th Qtr Earnings CC.\n\nHowever, I would look for an update on all of the relevant topics with a positive spin\u2026 that\u2019s the new MicroVision where the minor dilution of (2.5 million shares sold for $50 million) was done before the 4th Qtr Earnings CC, and not afterwards as has been the case over the past 15 years.\n\nI expect MVIS stock to move forward and not backwards. I would NOT expect that everything is status quo. MicroVision of today is an energetic, vibrant and a wealthy company with a market cap of over $2.5 billion\u2026 a historical high.\n\nSo if you own the stock now at the current price and we find out that things are improving and progressing well, why would you sell?\n\nI would look for a mention that we have 50 million more going into 4th Qtr Earnings CC, that we didn't have a few weeks ago. I would expect that the Lidar A-Sample is on target for April and some key specs have improved. I would expect that we have multiple companies conducting due diligence toward acquiring the company.\n\n**MicroVision: Why a $150 stock when acquired for $20 Billion?**\n\nReal billion dollar ideas have trillion dollar market size, they are scalable, and leverage the drivers of growth to go viral or global.\n\nIn my last [research on MicroVision ](https://www.lerumba.com/Directory/microvision-holds-the-keys-to-the-future-3000-profit-potential-in-over-10-billion-ma-article-132.aspx#.YEpP3Z1KjIU)(NASDAQ: MVIS), I introduced this 20 year old high-tech company that is at the cusp of acquisition by a major technology company. In the last few weeks, MVIS stock price has gone up by 60-fold \\[from 25 cents to over $15\\] on well qualified speculations. Now it is trading in the $14 to $24 range giving new investors the opportunity to take position; for the future of $70 to $150 dollar trading range in the next 12-months or so... depending on the acquisition price of $10 billion or $20 billion.\n\n**Here's the short answer...**\n\nEach of the Six LBS core technology verticals can spawn Trillion dollar markets of the future. Considering the diversity of its product line, built around the LBS core technology over the last 20 years, and protected by it's IP and 500 patents, each core vertical can spawn markets worth trillions, and be worth billions in an acquisition or a merger.\n\n**Why sell the company or merge with a deep pocket Tier 1 Technology partner...**\n\nAt low volumes, the cost of components that MicroVision sells to its Tier 1 partners is 5 to 10 times higher than what it is sold for in anticipation of large quantities... and loosing money on each component sold is what has shaped the company's past blunders loosing millions of dollars each quarter for the last 15 years.\n\nFinally, to sell the company, or to sell one or all of its 6 core vertical engines that can spawn trillion dollar markets, is the right decision. Under the leadership and stewardship of a deep pocket Tier 1 technology partner from the FAMGA gang can truly realize the potential of MicroVision technology, and bring hundred of products to the market that will be sold in billion units per year.\n\nIn the last few weeks, MVIS stock price has gone up by 60-fold \\[from 25 cents to over $14.95\\] on qualified speculations. Now it is trading in the $14 to $24 range giving new investors the opportunity to take position; for the future of $70 to $150 dollar trading range in the next 12- months or so... depending on the acquisition price of $10 billion or $20 billion.\n\n[**What to expect from sale or merger of MicroVision...**](https://www.lerumba.com/Directory/microvision-30-stock-when-acquired-for-5-billion-article-127.aspx#.Xz3sPchKjIX)\n\nOver the last 3 decades, the FAMGA tech giants \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple \u2014 have collectively made [770 acquisitions](https://www.cbinsights.com/search/deals/?invs=1038%2C1167%2C10160%2C12103%2C19786&amp;comStatusIds=2&amp;invStages=M%26A&amp;limit=25&amp;offset=0&amp;displayType=table). Even amid the Covid-19 pandemic, some have continued to write checks, with Apple being the [most active acquirer in 2020 to date](https://www.cbinsights.com/search/deals/?sdate=2020-01-01&amp;edate=2020-05-05&amp;invs=1038%2C1167%2C10160%2C12103%2C19786&amp;comStatusIds=2&amp;invStages=M%26A&amp;limit=25&amp;offset=0&amp;displayType=table) among them.\n\nThis FAMGA group of acquirers has deep pockets. Some of their biggest checks have been written for high-profile companies such as career platform [LinkedIn](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/linkedin) (acquired by Microsoft for $26.2B), chat app [WhatsApp](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/whatsapp) (Facebook for $22B), and video-sharing platform[YouTube](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/youtube) (Google for $1.7B).\n\nLuminar Technologies ([LAZR](http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LAZR?p=LAZR)) went public and the stock price at $40 dollars more than doubled in two days as a public company, with a market cap of over $14 billion\u2026 and made its co-founder CEO Austin Russell a billionaire \u2500 at the age of 25. Luminar specializes in making Lidar sensors for the [automotive sector](http://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/) that will be used in the development of autonomous vehicles.\n\nHowever, the keys to several future technologies are being held by an older company MicroVision that was always ahead of its time. [MicroVision](http://www.microvision.com/) (MVIS), founded in 1993, is most famous for their Micro Electro Mechanical systems (MEMs) and Laser Beam Scanning (LBS) technology that is protected by over 500 patents.\n\nMicroVision\u2019s automotive Lidar will be packaged in a solid-state module that is smaller, cheaper and more versatile than potential competitors like Luminar and Velodyne.\n\nAutonomous vehicles of the future will utilize MicroVision\u2019s Lidar because it is a superior \u201cBest in Class\u201d technology compared to Luminar and Velodyne; and due to its small size, 280M range, and point cloud density of 20 million points per second.\n\nT**OP 5 ACQUISITIONS BY COMPANY**\n\nBelow, we break down each of these companies\u2019 top 5 acquisitions by value.

        "selftext": " *Join me on this rocket ship named QFIN.*\n\nI have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I\u2019ve got good news for all ape-kind: I\u2019ve found one. Here\u2019s my DD (whatever that means). \n\nTicker: **QFIN**, AKA \"360 Digitech\". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. \n\n**Here's their business model:**\n\n*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.\n\n*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) \n\n*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. \n\n*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.\n\nThe business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.\n\n**But first, let\u2019s talk numbers.** 2017 Revenue: *175 million* 2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* 2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* TTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months)\n\nObviously that\u2019s insane growth. Most apes can\u2019t even count that high. \n\nAnd yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That\u2019s less than half the P/E of the S&amp;P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.** \n\nTo understand why the stock is still so cheap, let\u2019s talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it. \n\nFirstly, I assume most of you haven\u2019t bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit \u2013 it\u2019s next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low\u2026. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what\u2019s caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.\n\nThis is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn\u2019t that there\u2019s extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the \u201cproblems\u201d are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood\u2026 so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. \n\n**First Reason for Doubt \u2013 Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. \n\nOne regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*\n\n**Why it doesn\u2019t matter:** According to QFIN\u2019s CEO, Wu \u201cCock Slapper\u201d Haisheng, *\u201cCurrently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.\u201d* \n\nAnother new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem \u2013 QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. \n\n**Second Reason for Doubt \u2013 Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China\u2019s economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.\n\n**Why it doesn\u2019t matter:** First of all, *sack up.* \n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn\u2019t a bank. *(Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.)* Remember their business model I mentioned earlier? \n\n*Now consider this:* \n\nRemember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. *(600mm interest expense).* Meanwhile, **they\u2019re receiving 8 billion in service revenue**. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN)) They\u2019re bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they\u2019re bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren\u2019t a bank. What\u2019s even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN\u2019s loans defaults to FINV\u2019s, who shot up *90%* yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f](https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f) \n\nIf you\u2019re too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN\u2019s historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower. \n\nAnother facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, \u201cTotal operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency\u201d \u2013 CFO Alex \u201cOh God Please No Not My Face\u201d Xu \n\n**Third Reason for Doubt \u2013 uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs**\n\nOK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It\u2019s also the most nebulous. \n\nA few things to think about: \n\nThis is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I\u2019m not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird. \n\nSpeaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. *In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are.* Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN\u2019s loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving*. QFIN did the opposite \u2013 they devalued the loans by too much* (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). \u201c...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.\u201d \u2013 Ethan \u201cProlapse King\u201d Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued.\n\n**What risks are there still?**\n\nFirst and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk. Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like, for now, that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators seemed to have a hard on for fucking up Ant Group \u2013 a spinoff of Alibaba. Jack \u201cActual Vampire\u201d Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations after disappearing the guy for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN\u2019s stock, as another Chinese Fintech company, got dragged down by the bears despite not really being affected. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie\u2019s red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting.\n\n**Any big banana showers coming soon?** YES! **Earnings call on 3/15!** QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it\u2019ll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet. \n\nIf you still aren\u2019t convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon. \n\nTLDR: I like the stock.\n\n*This is obviously not financial advice.*\n\n*Positions: long 15 QFIN 3/19 calls 35 strike, and long 500 shares (cost basis $27.48)*\n\nEDIT: had to remove my source for the conference call quotes since it was SA and therefore blocking posting. If you want the source of the quotes, just google \"QFIN EARNINGS TRANSCRIPT\"",

They have existed for over a hundred years and have weathered every economic depression since the Panic of 1896\n\nRoll-based snacks are the future of food as we know it. There are several unique catalysts that can make Tootsie Roll a truly transformative company in the coming years.\n\nFinancials - Tootsie Roll has a fantastic balance sheet overall. It is sitting on a lot of cash and has increased its dividends for over 50 years. Future acquisitions and mergers could provide good growth prospects. Even better, there is the very real possibility that Tootsie could expand past the candy industry. Innovative technology start-ups could be bought with the over 200 million dollars that Tootsie has stowed away. Markets such as the EV sector are prime for this expansion.\n\nFuture Management - The current CEO and President is Ellen Gordon, who is 89 years old and may soon be replaced. A potential new CEO could turn things around for this company and disrupt the industry. Suppose Jack Ma ends up fleeing China in the future. Where better to end up than at $TR? The possibilities are endless.\n\nWhen they go low, we go high. Tootsie gang, rise up.",

        "selftext": "This due diligence analysis looks at one possible scenario involving the potential break up of the Rite Aid corporation that projects a return of more than two times (2X) the closing share price of $24.78 on Friday, March 12th, 2021.\n\nThe Rite Aid (RAD) corporation consists of two (2) business units:\n\n1. The Retail Pharmacy business currently generating approximately $16 billion in annual revenues.\n2. The Prescription Benefits Management (PBM) services business known as ELIXIR, currently generating approximately $8 billion in annual revenues.\n\nOne possible scenario for unlocking the value of RAD involves the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business and Rite Aid brand. What is left is the ELIXIR PBM organization. Here is an estimation of how such an approach might play out:\n\n* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. That represents an average price of $2.275 million per store.\n* Should RAD seek a buyer for its Retail Pharmacy business, it could sell its 2,450 remaining stores as well as the Rite Aid brand. Despite the fact that many of these stores are located in highly attractive locations (CA, OH, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, VA, etc), let's discount the average value of each store by 20% (compared to the average price-per-store paid by Walgreens), and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $1.8 million per store.\n* At a average price of $1.8 million per store, RAD could reasonably generate proceeds of $4.4 billion with the sale of the entire Retail Pharmacy business, including the 2,450 locations and the Rite Aid brand name (assigning no good will value to the brand).\n* The remaining RAD organization essentially consists of a PBM branded as ELIXIR and a net amount of cash on hand of +$1.2 billion, assuming that $3.2 billion of the Retail Pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing long-term debt on the company's books.\n* ELIXIR's projected sales for RAD's fiscal year 2021 (ending February 2021) are approximately $8 billion. During each of the past four (4) quarters, RAD has reported ELIXIR's year-over-year growth rate to be in the range of 23 - 29%.\n* ELIXIR's projected EBITDA for fiscal 2022 (begining March of 2021) will likely be approximately $200 million. Once again, I am taking a conservative estimate, and basically considering that a business that has grown 23 - 29% each quarter for the past year, will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year.\n* With only 55,000,000 shares outstanding today, the $200 million EBITDA generated by ELIXIR translates to roughly $3.60 per share in earnings. Using a highly conservative PE multiple of 8, a stock price of $28.80 results. However, the cash-on-hand of $1.2 billion (from the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business after long-term debt payoff) produces additional value of $22.00 per share, resulted in a stock price value of more than $50 per share (which is more than double the closing share price of $24.78 on Friday, March 12th, 2021).\n* The newly created company, ELIXIR, would be well-positioned for growth in the small-to-mid-size opportunity segment of the $400 billion per year PBM industry. With a net $1.2 billion in cash, that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition.\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis indicates that the conservative value of RAD today is $50 per share, well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market, which is just under $25 as of Friday, March 12, 2021.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the Rite Aid corporation is the best strategic path forward. (I personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $100 in the next 12 - 24 months if it keeps the entire organization fully in tact.) Rather, the purpose of the post was to reveal the hidden value locked within RAD that is clearly being overlooked by the investment community, by analyzing one possible break-up scenario.",

        "selftext": "Today was a day similar to Tuesday, tech and semiconductors rallied while the financial sector and oil lagged behind. The 10 Year Treasury Yield ($TNX) was up a little from Wednesday's low, however it is still down for the week. Current yield is 1.527%. \n\nMy portfolio is up more than 8% today, but we still have a little ways to go to reach the highest peak that I reached a couple weeks ago. Overall, it is looking like this might be a V-shaped tech recovery - a lot of overreaction. The only positions that was filled today was 10 shares of Roblox ($RBLX). I would like to see two green day candles in a row before I start jumping back into my shorter term calls. I'm believe we will pull back a little tomorrow in tech, and Monday I'll be looking for entries on more calls if we hold up until then. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35ut8x2xoim61.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=774a66c970de9c828a83f652ee90d740ac05a371\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Adding to the Watchlist:** \n\n**$RIDE:** Lordstown Motors Corporation is an American automobile manufacturer of electric vehicles. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5oyyowbzoim61.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc42796a9aebda5deaedfe4b7c4dee1ec5d7d060\n\n$RIDE is working on their electric pickup truck to try and take a piece of the $190B American truck market. It has the looks of a more traditional American pickup and in my opinion, looks better than Rivian's version. Although super futuristic looking, the cyber truck might not appeal to everyone and the price target is around $18,000 more than the Lordstown for the AWD version. Deliveries of the Lordstown Endurance are expected to begin in the fall of 2021, with full production ramping up throughout 2022; we can preorder on their website now for only $100 deposit. Welcome to the future. Currently $RIDE is trading below the 180 MA. Once it breaks this and tests it as a support, I'd be interested in buying this stock. \n\n* Target Price: $35\n* Entry: $20\n* Risk: 3\n* Timeframe: 4-6 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/749r8501pim61.png?width=1151&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e37e541b070f9dca03827b7841fcc37380bfea2\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n$**CPNG**: Coupang is a South Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. The biggest IPO on the NYSE from an Asian company since Alibaba. The $CPNG IPO was, for the most part, overshadowed by the Roblox IPO from Wednesday. Coupang has been compared to the Amazon of Korea. The Korean e-commerce market in 2018 was $100B and is growing rapidly. Coupang has a unique [returns ](https://www.expatguidekorea.com/article/how-to-return-a-product-on-coupang.html)system. On their app, you can select to return the product and where the delivery courier will pick it up. It is as simple as clicking a few buttons on their app and placing the product outside of your front door. It seems to me like a big deal. No technical analysis is need on $CPNG as it just IPO'd today. I'm interested to see if it will pull back before pulling the trigger on this one. \n\n* Target Price: $70\n* Entry: $45\n* Risk: 4\n* Timeframe: 3-5 months\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n$**CAKE**: The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated is an American restaurant company and distributor of cheesecakes based in the United States.

Over the last couple of years $CAKE has opened up restaurants in China and doing extremely well there. At Shanghai Disney's location I once had to wait for 4 hours to get a table.

        "selftext": "It was a decent day for tech stocks as I expected this dip to be short lived. It seems like the 10 year treasury note is cooling off and giving a boost of confidence to investors to buy more growth. Last Thursday, after a good week, I predicted tech to ease up Friday for the week's close before more buyers came out on Monday. Seems like that was accurate. \n\n*Processing img uy776anlqan61...*\n\n I ended up not getting into any new positions, however I had some limit orders placed for options that never got filled. In case you missed it, the $GME put was to close a \"Meme Stock of the Week\" thing that I was doing on my channel. Basically, I let you guys vote on which meme stock to put $100 on each week.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4tu16gknqan61.png?width=1104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35335afa23fa570787d80fcf2c238d6bca87e1f1\n\n My portfolio is up 3.66% today, or $22,830. I get asked almost every write up I do, \"How much did you start with and when\". Maybe I'll start putting that at the end of every post. Every Monday to Friday I post my PNL update, since there is a change; weekends I don't usually. So, in 2011 I started my investing journey with -$500 and without adding money (actually subtracting) I was at $330k in my stock portfolio (webull) by 2020. I might do a special post or video about this, since there seems to be enough interest.

As some of my loyal followers know, I have a lot of experience with crypto mining and specifically with Ebang. I've visited their factory and personally know some of the sales reps. Back in 2016-2017 I was purchasing many of their ASIC miners and using them in some of the mining centers that we established in China. My personal opinion on them is pretty negative. Their hardware is greatly inferior to Bitmain's and they always break and have problems. The hashing power isn't close either. The resell value on the machines is much lower as well; not many people want them because their life span isn't great. *Not to mention, their factory was one of the dirtiest places I'd ever seen.* \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c2w8f66rqan61.png?width=563&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be676abfd278b08f47e5b4576bb2b8238b38f6ca\n\nObviously $BTC is close to all time highs again so this company's revenue is up. However in my opinion, people only buy Ebang's hardware because they can't buy Bitmain's or Innosilicon's. \n\nBecause of this and because $EBON is up more than a 100% recently, I think a PUT is interesting. As you can see, I already tried to buy one today, but it didn't get filled. I'll be trying again tomorrow. I'm still going to put this as a risk level 5 because it seems not matter what, crypto stocks are super hot recently. I literally feel like there is no standards what can be publicly traded on the NYSE anymore. \n\n* Target Price: $6.50\n* Entry: &gt;$11\n* Risk: 5 \n* Timeframe: 2-3 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wx08w2uqan61.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c40ab369d7f7b335e6f2c82c9fc647ff67f3c04e\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n$**DRIV/$IDRV**: Two electric vehicle and autonomous driving ETFs that I would like to add to my watchlist. I already have a very large position on EVs and I don't need anymore. But, if you are considering getting positions in EVs while they are down, consider these two. Overall, I find that ETFs' diversity makes them more safe. If we look at the day chart, these two ETFs didn't get beat down as bad as $TSLA or $XPEV (going to test drive this week) did during this dip. Both have already gotten past the 50 day MA again and tested it as a support. Living in China, the world's largest EV market, has really opened my eyes to how fast this will grow and how much of a big deal it is. I think there are a lot of North Americans that still haven't realized this. \n\nIt is hard to put a price target on these because they consist of so many different companies. However, I'd recommend start dollar cost averaging into these lovely ETFs while they are teasing the 50MA. I think once they Super Trend flips green, its off off and away. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/synvwjovqan61.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de2ec461215d8d8ea35e3829d5a128647e8fd9cf\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n$**IRM**: Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), founded in 1951, is the global leader for storage and information management services. Iron Mountain stores and protects billions of valued assets, including critical business information, highly sensitive data, and cultural and historical artifacts. Providing solutions that include secure records storage, information management, digital transformation, secure destruction, as well as data centers, cloud services and art storage and logistics.\n\nAs of recent, $IRM has shifted more towards storing and protecting sensitive data (cloud). As we progress into a more technological world and society, this will be more sought after and $IRM is positioning itself to dominate this space. I'm interested in a short term call or vertical spread on $IRM. I think the risk to reward ratio makes a lot of sense at 32DTE for $40; or the $37.5/$45 vert spread. Because of the short expiration date, I give this a risk of 4; if you want to hold shares (6.67% div yield), this would be less risk up to around $47. \n\n* Target Price: $40\n* Entry: $36\n* Risk: 4\n* Timeframe: 1-2 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1o80nfqwqan61.png?width=1147&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c82a47858f34c529132ad2f0f37276f1c606d8a\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \n\nNote: Risk (1 out of 5) is my opinion of how risky the stock and these plays are; 1 being the lowest and 5 is the highest.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \n\n Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations",

        "selftext": "# Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH?\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\n\\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# The Fundamental Constraint\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9uystsmn0n61.png?width=1613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=612d845bce1686629bd7aa7d2bedef5028891ba9\n\nThis one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It\u2019s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, **trustworthiness and accountability must be established**. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you\u2019re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pms84rvhpvm61.png?width=2073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11914ae63ebcb5a662e9c623e7caf558382539e5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3wqso7bkovm61.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88e922d828b2fb5655e4ce433e6bfcf05f5ff891\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fl6iy73p0n61.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ab621637733790abcc73468f29aa300950f6d2c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/juszlp60rvm61.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8537287a2d45d8869023d66f80d67e506c7070e6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7cgc88hl0n61.png?width=1772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0234ebda1584799431ac5ee4936c580cd5e99d2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Underbanked\n\nJack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b83hyt7yl0n61.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf497fa79d6162b868fac37c54aed27f13efbdf8\n\nInterestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.\n\nIn my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:\n\n\\- Cash App\u2019s Twitter and advertising strategy\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1qvo71pmm0n61.png?width=1487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bca7632db9415950320744b438310aba1518a105\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjm7d1fpm0n61.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8604ba6d3b892c789c2a3d8a615ed2dd38b31cb4\n\n\\- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching \u201cCash App vs. Venmo\u201d. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl52ye7ym0n61.png?width=2949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=632d7f0b5043f169520fdb1af54bc3c8a3080322\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chicago's North vs. South Sides](https://preview.redd.it/r3l5dtm7n0n61.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2d7b39081a3229ef0d163dc5bba00a2d861eeb7)\n\nIt is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square\u2019s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You\u2019ve heard it before, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?\u201d. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:\n\n1. The ability to start a business\n2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks\n3. The ability to invest and educate in B\\*tcoin\n4. The ability to save on basic purchases\n5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)\n\nWhat this inevitably means is that we probably won\u2019t even see Square operating at \u201cfull-force\u201d until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.\n\n# Speculation\n\nThis is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:\n\n1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank\u2019s regulatory offerings.\n2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.\n3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.\n4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with orgs like Visa or MasterCard.\n5. Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.\n6. Square will foray into equal housing.\n7. Square will improved loan systems.\n8. Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease follow for more content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/06hGKT6YUeRY99vz4MVPPh0-7..1569477220.jpg)",

        "selftext": " Last week finished on a high note for the Nasdaq, tech and semiconductors. $QQQ is almost back to the 50MA as well as SOXL is currently at the 50MA on the day chart. Also the 10 year treasury yield has pulled back to 1.66%, and overall not showing a clear sign of which direction it will be moving. Since March 17th, it has been trading around the current level. I'm not convinced that it will move to much beyond 1.7%. If I am right, this will benefit tech and growth the most. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3kiyleerwp61.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93d9bb1dd484330abead2435259de0972ffdd356\n\nOf course, with the economy opening up, we need a couple recovery plays. Overall, I think most investors are a little to hopeful with how well future earnings will be. For example, airline stocks are overbought right now. It is my opinion that even though people will have the ability to travel more this summer, there won't necessarily be a huge surge in business travelers now that they are use to Zoom conferencing and most likely have reduced their travel budgets. My general opinion is that the rotation into cyclicals and re-opening plays are starting to be overbought. Nevertheless, I do like two sectors - gambling and credit cards.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Mentions for the Week:**\n\n**$BJK:** The VanEck Vectors Gaming is a Gaming ETF that includes casinos and casino hotels, sports betting (including internet gambling and racetracks) and lottery services as well as gaming services, gaming technology and gaming equipment. Most notable holdings include, Las Vegas Sands, Draft Kings, MGM, Caesars, Sands China etc.\n\nWith Las Vegas opening up, and this summer at a high for the year, this is a safe and excellent choice. I first wrote about this one on my post for the Week of March 26, and my view is still relatively the same although it has started moving up from my buy zone as predicted. In general I like options expiring in the fall of this year at minimum. A vertical spread around. A $60/70 spread currently is only going to cost $168.\n\n* Target Price: $70\n* Entry: &lt;$50\n* Risk: 2\n* Timeframe: 4-6 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zv7n4mrgrwp61.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d01e4d643f82b489115dbcb80c05939aba025e3\n\n \n\n$**MA**: Mastercard Incorporated is an American multinational financial services corporation, and I believe that when the economy is opening up, Americans will be spending more on their credit cards. This pick is also another no-brainer for myself, especially coming off of a trip to the 50MA on the day chart. I'd give this a low risk score of a 2, just be careful when choosing your expiration on options - make sure you have enough time for anything unexpected. Vertical spreads are also appealing here, as you can save a lot of capital to further diversify.\n\n* Target Price: $413\n* Entry: &lt;$360\n* Risk: 2\n* Timeframe: 2-4 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4ldqrzhrwp61.png?width=1085&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03b3bdb8e47d96eacf26c2aac934d01912fc0ec8\n\n \n\n$**BUZZ**:\n\nVanEck Vectors Social Sentiment ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks to track as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the BUZZ NextGen AI US Sentiment Leaders Index (the \u201cSentiment Leaders Index\u201d). Although $BUZZ is a new ETF, I do believe that it will outperform other ETFs during the reopening period this year because it has a mix of re-opening plays and growth/tech plays.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wh62j75jrwp61.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=089d91a491373217f7c56b1e7a03b30c90163a42\n\n It has made all that much progress since launching and is in my opinion a good buy right now. I'm mostly interested in commons or longer term call options as this one will take some time to develop and mature, although I do think that it can double in due time.\n\n* Target Price: $50\n* Entry: &lt;$20\n* Risk: 4\n* Timeframe: 4-6 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u9lchydkrwp61.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=515d6ea6ffc74c6afaae059613fc5f0ef6dd0a37\n\n \n\n$**NIKE**: As you probably have heard, Nike has come under pressure from Chinese netizens along with a handful of other foreign companies in the Middle Kingdom. It all stemmed from a ban on Xinjiang cotton. Xinjiang is a province in far NW China which is home to Uyghurs ethnic minority. Although Nike first spoke out against the Xinjiang forced labor last November, for some reason the Chinese are just getting angry about it. Currently, I live in Shanghai and I can tell you that this started blowing up last week; it was huge news online. However, stores are open and I can confirm I still see many people wearing Nike and Adidas shoes on the streets. In my opinion, it is just theatrics and the online anger will die down sooner than later. I like Nike as a buy right now, although a little riskier given current conditions.\n\nI'm going with a shorter term call on this, possibly a spread to reduce risk. I do believe that it will jump back up to the $145 level relatively soon once this blows over. Just with the negative press in China, $NIKE dropped to it's 180MA on the day chart.\n\n* Target Price: $145\n* Entry: &lt;$130\n* Risk: 4-5 (depending on expiration)\n* Timeframe: 1-2 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62536kamrwp61.png?width=1091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c58bcb4d36f5b4ccf523c5585202f7988f12ab3a\n\n \n\n$**ARKX**: The ARK Space Exploration ETF and Emerge ARK Space Exploration ETF are set to list concurrently on **Tuesday, March 30**. It is the first product launched by Cathie Wood and the ARK team in two years and the markets have been eagerly anticipating this moment. As far as the holdings, we won't know until the first week of April.\n\nI really do think that this is going to be a huge moment in time for Ark Invest and Cathie Wood. Space is the future, and companies will have an increasing demand for launching Earth Orbital Vehicles, satellites or other going forward. Not to mention the popularizing and romanticizing of space, once again, by Space X. The biggest question for myself is, \"How much money will I buy $ARKX with?\", or actually, \"How much money do I have left to buy $ARKX with?\". I'll be buying as soon as I can, and I'm thinking of putting $20-30,000 into this in commons or LEAPS. No matter which, $ARKX is a long term play for me, and I believe this will be printing money in the next 5-10 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNote: Risk (1 out of 5) is my opinion of how risky the stock and these plays are; 1 being the lowest and 5 is the highest.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.",

        "selftext": "IQST is forecasted to produce revenues of half its current market cap for 2021. I think this has potential to 8-16x within the next couple of years- the company has been growing fast and just became debt free, and their revenues have been growing at an insane rate. They\u2019ve had some extreme year over year growth, producing $13 mil in 2018, $18 mil in 2019, and approximately $44 mil in 2020, and they\u2019re forecasted to produce $60.5 mil in 2021.\n\nThis company provides services to the Telecom, EV, Liquid Fuel Distribution, Chemical, and Financial Services Industries. They have 4 business divisions- telecom, technology, fintech, and blockchain. They have both B2B and B2C models. Their goals for the future are to provide better telecom services, solutions, and applications by creating new tech solutions to meet the specific needs of their worldwide customers. Just by looking through their subsidiaries, I believe this is a Merger and Acquisition or Holding company, as it seems that they normally have a majority stakehold in most of the companies they list on their website. One thing I like about this company is that they\u2019re involved in so many different sectors that even if one fails, they still have the other companies that will still produce revenues for them. Also, they will pretty much always be having revenues from the B2B aspect of their business, so that\u2019s definitely a plus.\n\nThere\u2019s alot of companies involved here, and I really like how they give us a very simple break down of each one. I\u2019m not going to go over every single one just to keep this DD short, but I wanted to point out the ones that have great revenues and the ones that have great future potential. \n\nhttps://www.qglobalsms.com/\n\nQGlobalSMS provides high quality SMS services and competitive prices for wholesale markets, governments, corporations, and small and medium enterprises. Essentially a business-to-business SMS service. I do want to point out that IQST owns 51% of this company, not 100%. What really makes me excited about this company is their revenues, they bring in about $30 million in revenues per year, with 95% of it being prepaid, which is just insane. This essentially allows them to have a huge cash flow right off the bat to use for other projects.\n\nhttps://www.etelix.com/\n\nThe next company, Etelix offers a suite of tech solutions for wholesale carriers, corporations, and small and medium enterprises in the telecom space. Again, I\u2019m talking about this due to their revenues- they have over 200 customers, with a $14 million revenue forecast for 2021, and have been in operation for over 13 years. So we can definitely see this as being a stable revenue source for IQST.\n\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqst--iqstel-announces-ceo-shareholder-letter-discussing-revenue-growth-and-capital-structure-improvements-301210937.html\n\nThe revenue numbers for the other companies weren\u2019t listed on their websites, so I\u2019m not going to talk about the revenues from those, however, a few of them are actually new projects that the company is looking to finish and create revenues from. So, in 2020, the three new subsidiaries they incorporated were the acquisitions of QGlobalSMS, which I talked about, Iot Labs, and the creation of Global Money One, LLC. Their existing subsidiaries were Etelix, Swisslink and ItsBChain. Now, we know that Etelix and QGlobalSMS are producing around $44 mil for 2021 or $29 million if we\u2019re only taking half the revenues from QGlobalSMS, so with the rest of the businesses, it\u2019ll be relatively easy to actually make their forecasted $60.5 mil revenues for 2021. \n\nI think this is already an industry leader in the SMS and VOIP industries, and their expansion to the fintech arena and IoT sectors is going to bring them even more success and revenues in the future.\n\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqst--iqstel-announces-mobile-number-portability-application-blockchain-platform-301239807.html\n\nThis PR talks about how they announced their subsidiary ItsBChain launching a new application built with blockchain that allows a person to change from one carrier to another in just 3 clicks without the need for talking to customer service reps, and waiting days for approval for them to port it over. Their initial estimation of the market size is approximately $260 million annually, and they\u2019re looking to capture about 10% of the market between 2021-2023, so I\u2019m expecting around $26 million in revenues per year from this company. I think they\u2019ll definitely be able to capture a large amount of the market share, as this is huge innovation for that sector- I mean think about the last time you had to switch phone numbers, it\u2019s a relatively long process that is a inconvenience. With this platform, you can just port over your phone number in 3 clicks, which I think is a huge game changer.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/iqst-iqstel-visa-debit-card-142800727.html\n\nThe next subsidiary is Global Money One, and they just announced their new Visa Debit Card service is scheduled to launch by June 2021. The Debit Card is expected to generate estimated revenues over five years of $45 million to $128 million with an approximate profit margin of 30% to 40%. Now, IQST owns 75% of the company where PayVMS who is building the service owns 25%, so it\u2019s in both of their best interests that this company does really well. In my opinion, I\u2019m trying to look at this stock without accounting for revenues from this company, since it\u2019s not a surefire thing whether it will be successful or not. If it is, great, if not, at least I\u2019m not disappointed.\n\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqst--iqstel-announces-ma-campaign-with-potential-to-push-revenue-over-60-5-million-forecast-301256102.html\n\nI\u2019ve been saying they\u2019re forecasting $60.5 million for their revenues for 2021, and this PR is talking about how they\u2019re confirming that forecast. One thing I like is that they point out that it does not include any contribution from potential acquisitions, and they could actually exceed the current forecast if their merger and acquisition campaign goes well. They also recently eliminated all debt, and have a growing cash reserve anticipated to exceed $2 million by the end of Q1. Again, that $60.5 million number is not including potential acquisitions, and management says they anticipate that their potential could increase for the 2021 revenue forecast by the end of Q2, so they\u2019re really making moves quick to make deals and acquire other companies. \n\n2019/2018 Annual report: https://sec.report/Document/0001078782-20-000260/\n\nReal quick, I did want to go through their financials from 2018 up until 2020, just to show you guys their numbers. In 2018, we see they had about $2.3mil in assets, about $3.9 mil in liabilities, had a revenue of about $13.7 mil and had profits of $1.1mil. They actually had net losses of $2.1mil which isn\u2019t a good sign.\n\nIn 2019, they had doubled their assets to $5.6 million, but also significantly raised their liabilities to $11.1 million. They did up their revenues by about $4.2 million compared to 2018 bringing in $18 million in revenues, but had a net loss of $5.4 million which was even greater than 2018.\n\nhttps://sec.report/Document/0001078782-20-000847/\n\nWe don\u2019t have the annual report for 2020 yet, so these are for the months of January until September 30, 2020. They were able to more than double their revenues for the same period in 2019, bringing in $29.4 mil in revenues, and were able to lower their net loss to $3.5 mil.\n\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iqst--iqstel-announces-ma-campaign-with-potential-to-push-revenue-over-60-5-million-forecast-301256102.html\n\nNow, going back to the forecast for 2021, we know that they eliminated all debt, which is incredible, those liabilities are gone now. They\u2019re actually starting to have some free cash reserves, and are looking to exceed $2 million by the end of Q1 2021. Now, read this very last sentence. With a solid and improving balance sheet, growing revenues and improving margins, management remains confident in its previously announced NASDAQ uplisting objective. This company is super ambitious and is planning to uplist to NASDAQ which is huge. I definitely think it\u2019ll be able to do that within the next year, and they\u2019re absolutely setup for success.\n\nhttps://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/IQST/profile\n\nI really like how they\u2019re being super innovative and are just absolutely looking to crush it in the TeleCom, Tech, Fintech and Blockchain spaces. They definitely have proven they\u2019re able to create revenues, and now with them eliminating their debts, hopefully they\u2019ll be able to generate good profits this year too. Their recent acquisition for the Visa Debit Card has a very good margin in my opinion, about 30-40%, but again I\u2019m not really banking on that having an effect on the stock just so I\u2019m not disappointed. I really think that this stock is a one-of-a-kind OTC stock. Never have I seen a stock with such huge revenues be priced so low before. They have a market cap of only $120 million right now, and with a very conservative P/E ratio of 10, and using their financials from 2020, they should be around a $440 mil market cap. Using their forecasted 2021 revenues of $60.5 million, they should have around a $605 million market cap. Again, that\u2019s using a very conservative P/E ratio. I think it has potential to have around a 1 to 2 billion market cap.  Which would mean an 8 to 16x from its current price. \n\nI\u2019m super excited for this company, and I think it\u2019s an extremely good long hold. In my opinion, this is literally a NASDAQ stock trading on the OTC markets, which are pretty rare. Their plans to uplist to NASDAQ within the next 18 months is absolutely amazing!",

Obviously then I would use the MA lines with the highest percent chance of bouncing to make a trade.\n\nWhat do you guys think.\n\nI plan on starting at 9ma count by 2 or 3 up to 50,\nThen continue by 5 or 10 till I reach the 200ma \n\nThis is because I don\u2019t want to do every single number and as you get into higher numbers the lines start to move less and less apart.\n\nWhat do you guys think, is this a good idea. Has it already been done? Is they\u2019re a faster way to do this?\n\nI am asking because I just don\u2019t want to waste all of my time, if someone tells else did it, or it\u2019s just a dumb idea I won\u2019t even bother.\n\nThanks",

Although I wish that Ford, $F, would make such a heavy handed push towards electric, they aren't and the next best thing to Tesla is more than likely going to be Volkswagen. \n\nVolkswagen doesn't trade on the U.S. stock markets. However, you can buy it on the OTC exchange where it trades under the ticker symbol \u201cVWAGY.\u201d While volumes on the OTC exchange can be a concern, VWAGY stock has an average volume of over 350,000 shares, which looks decent. \n\nI was skeptical at first because of the bad reviews on the ID.4, however the more I looked into $VWAGY the more I liked it. \n\n* Target Price: $90\n* Entry: &lt;$35\n* Risk: 4\n* Timeframe: 10-18 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a2jb41hxpkn61.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b40cf1ae73b3dfbcbdde8800bd34c3612727d9e\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n$**FLGT**: Fulgent Genetics is a technology company providing comprehensive testing solutions through its scalable platform.

Considering Lucid will have cars on the street later this year, this is a great opportunity.  If you've been following my journey, you will know this isn't the first, nor the last, time I've mentioned this SPAC. \n\nDuring the last few weeks, we've had entries set around $24 - and earlier this year I was also buying it before the massive run up to $65 (taking profit).

Even yesterday most everything finished red, but $SOXL was up 4%. $SOXL was my best performer in 2020 by far. There is a global shortage of chips, and it is causing delays Tesla or NIO car productions, for example. \n\nBelieve it or not this dip we are in right now, was bigger for $SOXL than the Covid-19 dip from March by a noticeable amount. Companies like AMD, Nvidia, or Taiwan Semiconductor are not going anywhere, anytime soon and there will just be a bigger demand in the future, in my opinion. It seems that $SOXL is about to cross back above the 50 MA, which is a pretty big deal. I would be buying as much as I can and not looking back. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xo2i1g1qkn61.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6a2503f39bbb266710981aff0a7ec442994c2fd\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n Note: Risk (1 out of 5) is my opinion of how risky the stock and these plays are; 1 being the lowest and 5 is the highest.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.",

        "selftext": "**Not popular topics for those who expect the high tech momentum will dominate the most gains in stock market forever.** ***It is time to review one's portfolio to adjust and factor into risk translate to a resonable reward even when the market chills.*** \n\nPersonnel issues and lax risk controls loom large here.\n\n[**Robby Greengold, CFA**](https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2146/robby-greengold)Mar 31, 2021\n\n [ARK Innovation ETF\u00a0(ARKK)](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/arkk/quote), [American Beacon ARK Transfmt Innov A\u00a0(ADNAX)](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/adnax/quote)\n\nThematic-investing specialist ARK Investment Management has been in tune with the market\u2019s unfolding narrative in recent years, but its lone portfolio manager, inexperienced team, and lax risk controls make it ill-prepared to grapple with a major plot twist. Its flagship strategy, ARK Innovation ([ARKK](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/arkk/quote)), earns a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Neutral.\n\n## The Pitch and the Niche\n\nARK believes that equity indexes are full of value traps in danger of technological obsolescence and that traditional asset managers hew too closely to their benchmarks, thereby loading themselves up with stocks in [doomed industries](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ArkInvest_101420_Whitepaper_BadIdeas2020.pdf). Its solution is to invest across five technology platforms--artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics--that it thinks will revolutionize how economic sectors across the globe operate.\n\nTrue to form, the firm\u2019s products look unlike any index. The portfolio of its flagship strategy, ARK Innovation, is top-heavy, makes huge industry bets, and has historically invested in publicly traded companies of virtually every size. It embraces money-losing companies so long as they\u2019re aggressively investing to exceed their already high growth expectations.\n\nThe firm defines success differently from most long-only funds. Rather than aim to outperform an index, the firm cares most about achieving high returns and invests only in companies it thinks will gain 15% or more annualized over the next five years. That hurdle is roughly double the annualized return of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index (the fund\u2019s category benchmark) since 2000.\n\nThe firm\u2019s etf lineup has done far better than that. Its flagship strategy, which combines ideas expressed in its six other actively managed ETFs, gained 150% in 2020. A flood of inflows followed. Over the 12 months through February 2021, the firm\u2019s total assets under management leapt to roughly $80 billion from less than $12 billion.\n\nThe firm is shareholder-friendly in some ways. It has developed its product lineup thoughtfully by maintaining its focus on the handful of innovation platforms and underlying technologies it thinks have longevity. Its ETFs are cost-competitive relative to actively managed rivals.\n\nBut few features of its research team or process suggest ARK Innovation will continue to beat the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\n## The Key Person\n\nARK\u2019s main draw is its founder, chief executive officer, and portfolio manager Cathie Wood, who, after more than three decades in the industry, launched the firm in 2014.\n\n## MORE ON THIS TOPIC\n\n* [**No Room on the ARK?**](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682/no-room-on-the-ark)\n\nShe honed her thematic-oriented process at AllianceBernstein from 2001 to 2013, where she ran several strategies similar to this one that had high volatility, poor downside performance, and underwhelming long-term results during her tenure. During her 12 years at the helm of large-growth separate account AB MA Strategic Research, its before-fee total returns comfortably outpaced the Russell 1000 Growth Index *but lagged on a risk-adjusted basis*. She also managed two growth-oriented mutual funds--one focused on domestic mid-caps, the other on global stocks--whose net-of-fee results underperformed their bogies on her watch, risk-adjusted or otherwise.\n\nAnd yet, as ARK\u2019s primary investment decision-maker who has established a ubiquitous media presence and enthusiastic following, Wood is essential to the firm\u2019s continued success. Director of research Brett Winton would likely succeed her if needed, but his nearly 15 years of industry experience include none as a portfolio manager. Exacerbating that key-person risk is the firm\u2019s inability to develop and retain talent: Many of the analysts supporting the funds\u2019 research have come and gone, and most of the remaining nine\u00a0lack deep industry experience.\n\n## Not Your Typical Analyst Team\n\nThe firm\u2019s analyst bench is [distinct](https://ark-invest.com/the-ark-difference/) from traditional asset managers, but not in a good way. The typical equity research analyst in the asset management industry has a predictable set of credentials: an undergraduate degree from a name-brand institution, some entry-level work experience, an MBA, an analytical internship, and at least some progress toward investment-related credentials, such as becoming a CFA charterholder. Almost none of ARK's analysts have progress beyond earning bachelor's degrees.\n\nIndeed, ARK\u2019s research-related job postings [tend not](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Job_Positions/Job_Opportunity_Analyst-Fintech.pdf) to demand credentials of any kind. That sort of openness expands the applicant pool and invites individuals of various backgrounds and experiences to submit their resumes. The firm may be on to something there. Cognitively diverse teams can be more creative or innovative than those without a variety of perspectives.

Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.\n\n## Crowdsourcing\n\nARK outsources much of the technical expertise to \u201c[theme developers](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARK-Invest-Thematic-Investment-Process.pdf)\u201d--some of whom the firm says are academics, entrepreneurs, and former ARK analysts--who donate their time. It also invites feedback on its research and new investment ideas from individuals following the firm through social media. These features make the firm\u2019s process of gathering and digesting information unique, but its analytical edge remains unclear in an industry that provides (for a fee) subject-matter experts to advise shops that lack requisite technical know-how.\n\n## A Peculiar Analyst Coverage Model\n\nWood [thinks](https://youtu.be/-hnK2cEvbJg?t=350) other asset managers set up their analyst teams poorly to comprehend the potential impact of these technologies on the economy. Rather than assigning analysts coverage of economic sectors--a common industry practice that Wood thinks creates information silos--ARK assigns them one or more technological specialties. For example, [one](https://ark-invest.com/our-team/) analyst covers energy storage, robotics, and reusable rockets; another covers automation, robotics, energy storage, alternate energy, and space exploration.\n\nWood has a point. Technology is crucial to both its purveyors and consumers and influences the sales and expenses of companies across all industries. It follows that analysts who can accurately forecast the accessibility, cost declines, and adoption rates of the most promising innovations could have a stock-picking advantage. But her views on this don\u2019t radically diverge from her competitors. Many recognize the downsides of industry specialization and try to mitigate them by fostering collaboration across sectors or implementing a generalist approach.\n\nIn some ways, ARK\u2019s setup could lead to ultra-specialization and potential blind spots that better resourced firms wouldn\u2019t miss. For example, it assigns DNA sequencing, genome editing, and immunotherapy to two analysts who are early in their careers and at a disadvantage to their healthcare-focused rivals. The teams of other shops collaborate to cover biotech, pharma, and life-sciences firms in breadth and depth and staff their teams with seasoned analysts holding doctorates or other advanced degrees in medicine, biology, or neuroscience.\n\n## Unrestrained, Unaware, and Unconcerned\n\nARK Innovation\u2019s benchmark agnosticism and high return targets saddle the portfolio with risks that Wood manages mainly with instinct rather than data or rules. The firm, which has no risk management personnel, views the subject almost exclusively through the lens of its scoring system that monitors six inputs to a stock\u2019s investment thesis. They are:\n\n1) Company, People, and Culture  \n2) Execution  \n3) Moats: Barriers to Entry  \n4) Product Leadership  \n5) Valuation  \n6) Thesis Risk\n\nThese form the basis of levelheaded bottom-up research--most investment teams use some variation of them--but they provide little visibility into the portfolio\u2019s aggregate risk exposures.\n\nWood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock\u2019s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock\u2019s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another. There [is potential](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ARKInvest_052720_whitepaper_Innovation-Allocation.pdf) for diversification across innovation platforms--but the firm\u2019s self-categorization of its investable universe does not by itself imply a rigorous understanding of which stocks are likely to rise, fall, succeed, and fail together. Forward-looking estimates of the holdings\u2019 correlations and variances or other input from a separate risk-management team, on the other hand, would do more. (2)\n\nSuch analysis is complex and nonessential for most of this strategy\u2019s rivals. That\u2019s because the typical long-only equity strategy defines its risk limit and stays within it, for example, by anchoring its sector weights to prevent extreme sector concentration. ARK has few portfolio construction parameters. It has said it will generally invest no more than around 10% of ARK Innovation\u2019s assets in a single company (it has adhered to this guidance) and no more than half of ARK Innovation\u2019s assets in a single technology.\n\nTo be sure, ARK makes no promise to diversify its portfolios, and it [tells investors](https://youtu.be/Qb8uQSQi8bc?t=396) to expect volatility. But even a high-octane strategy like this one should be cognizant of the risks embedded in its portfolio and manage to a definable risk tolerance. It seems not to. Indeed, on March 29, 2021, the fund removed prospectus language limiting the size of its top positions and its ownership percentage of individual companies\u2019 shares outstanding.\n\n## Blind to the Future\n\nThe portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF\u2019s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn\u2019t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.\n\nThe firm has [minimized](https://ark-funds.com/innovation-webinar-series/capacity-and-liquidity-analysis) the notion that the ETF\u2019s *downside has become steeper*, mostly by relying on the past as a guide to the future. But its heft is new, and future market crises will be different from previous ones. Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio\u2019s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.\n\nBut even with such a team, there\u2019s no sign that Wood would heed its advice. A central tenet of her process is to amplify exposure to the fund\u2019s riskiest holdings when market uncertainty is highest. In a market crisis, her game plan is to sell first the fund\u2019s \u201ccashlike\u201d stocks--those that possess the most diversified sources of revenue, are typically large cap, and are the most liquid--to favor as few as 32 \u201cpure plays\u201d that are often unprofitable small caps that are less liquid and extremely volatile.\n\nShe followed a much milder version of this playbook at AllianceBernstein\u2019s Strategic Research strategy\u00a0during the market\u2019s 2008 implosion. There, she consolidated the portfolio to 47 or so stocks and kept it focused on liquid large caps. It did not have anywhere near the level of ownership in individual companies as ARK Innovation has today. In 2008, that large-growth-oriented separate account lost 45% before fees--substantially worse than the Russell 1000 Growth Index\u2019s 38% decline.\n\nOther potential consequences of the strategy's size are less dire but hinder its ability to exploit good ideas and oust bad ones. Nimble execution is now tougher than before. To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock\u2019s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position. (2)\n\n## Reasonable Doubts\n\nARK\u2019s pursuit of disruptive innovators has merit, and its quest for big rewards may appeal to aggressive investors who can stomach the risk of potentially heavy losses. But ARK\u2019s team of inexperienced analysts, go-with-your-gut risk management approach, and bloated asset base raise doubts about whether this fund\u2019s outstanding historical results can continue.\n\n## Works Cited\n\n*1.

        "selftext": " This analysis looks at one possible break-up scenario of the Rite Aid corporation that projects a return of more than 2X the closing share price of $22.55 on Wednesday, March 10, 2021.\n\nRite Aid (RAD) consists of two (2) parts:\n\n1. The Retail Pharmacy business currently generating approximately $16 billion in annual revenues.\n2. The Prescription Benefits Management (PBM) services business known as ELIXIR, currently generating approximately $8 billion in annual revenues.\n\nOne possible scenario for unlocking the value of RAD involves the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business and Rite Aid brand. What is left is the ELIXIR PBM organization. Here is an estimation of how such an approach might play out:\n\n* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. That represents an average price of $2.275 million per store.\n* Should RAD seek a buyer for its Retail Pharmacy business, it could sell its 2,450 remaining stores as well as the Rite Aid brand. Despite the fact that many of these stores are located in highly attractive locations (CA, OH, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, VA, etc), let's discount the average value of each store by 20% (compared to the average price-per-store paid by Walgreens), and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $1.8 million per store.\n* At a average price of $1.8 million per store, RAD could reasonably generate proceeds of $4.4 billion with the sale of the entire Retail Pharmacy business, including the 2,450 locations and the Rite Aid brand name (assigning no good will value to the brand).\n* The remaining RAD organization essentially consists of a PBM branded as ELIXIR and a net amount of cash on hand of +$1.2 billion, assuming that $3.2 billion of the Retail Pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing long-term debt on the company's books.\n* ELIXIR's projected sales for RAD's fiscal year 2021 (ending February 2021) are approximately $8 billion. During each of the past four (4) quarters, RAD has reported ELIXIR's year-over-year growth rate to be in the range of 23 - 29%.\n* ELIXIR's projected EBITDA for fiscal 2022 (begining March of 2021) will likely be approximately $200 million. Once again, I am taking a conservative estimate, and basically considering that a business that has grown 23 - 29% each quarter for the past year, will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year.\n* With only 55,000,000 shares outstanding today, the $200 million EBITDA generated by ELIXIR translates to roughly $3.60 per share in earnings. Using a highly conservative PE multiple of 8, a stock price of $28.80 results. However, the cash-on-hand of $1.2 billion (from the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business after long-term debt payoff) produces additional value of $22.00 per share, resulted in a stock price value of more than $50 per share (which is more than 2X the closing price of $22.55 on Wednesday, March 10, 2021).\n* The newly created company, ELIXIR, would be well-positioned for growth in the small-to-mid-size opportunity segment of the $400 billion per year PBM industry. With a net $1.2 billion in cash, that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition.\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis indicates that the conservative value of RAD today is $50 per share, well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market, which is just over $22.50.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the Rite Aid corporation is the best strategic path forward. (I personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $100 in the next 12 - 24 months if it keeps the entire organization fully in tact.) Rather, the purpose of the post was to reveal the hidden value locked within RAD that is clearly being overlooked by the investment community, by analyzing one possible break-up scenario.",

        "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: Please do your own research - no investment is without risk, and may lose value.\n\nMarket Cap = 146M. Share price at close = $7.91\n\nSECTOR: Information Technology, INDUSTRY: Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals\n\nSummary: One Stop Systems, Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets custom **high-speed computing systems** for high-performance edge computing applications in the US and internationally. Its GPU expansion units add hundreds of computing cores and teraflops of computing performance to virtually any original equipment manufacturer server. OSS' flash storage arrays provide hundreds of terabytes of storage and **millions of input/output operations per second** (see applications, below). It also offers servers for PCI express-over-cable expansion; desktop expansion appliances in various configurations that add input/output flexibility to any user's desktop system; **PCIe expansions,** and ruggedized mobile high-performance compute devices to meet specialized requirements for devices deployed at the edge in **various environmental conditions**. One Stop Systems, Inc. was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Escondido, California. \n\nAPPLICATIONS \\- buckle in, exciting stuff.\n\nWith wide-ranging applications like AI, autonomous cars, and military technologies we don't even know exist yet (laser tech, threat detection, missile targeting), \"edge computing\" is sure to expand and meet growing demand for high-performance computing able to provide millions of actionable data points every second. In January 2021, OSS announced their 4th military contract via project \u201cOrange Gear,\u201d an AI system that enables U.S. Navy aircraft to conduct real-time AI-powered threat detection. Shooting down enemy assets, what guides the weapon? OSS enables the second-to-second calculations to achieve such precision. \n\nInteresting fact: OSS chief sales and marketing officer Jim Ison says they are going to \u201cexpand the support of wartime theater applications for [land, sea, air and space](http://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2021/01/05/2153506/0/en/OSS-Wins-Fourth-Program-with-Major-Military-Contractor.html).\u201d ***SPACE***. What an incredible hint of things to come! The final frontier, space exploration represents a vast yet untapped potential area of edge computing expansion. Heck, the previous administration just created a new *branch of the military* specifically for protecting America\u2019s interests above the stratosphere. Also consider that the USA, with a defense budget of $700 billion annually, will likely purchase American-made edge computing tech in-house, avoiding adversaries like China. OSS seems here to stay.\n\nWhile military contracts might not whet your appetite, consider autonomous driving. OSS\u2019 ingenious \u201cAI on the Fly\u201d enables in-vehicle \u201cruggedized\u201d autonomous driving. Here is a company rep, much smarter than myself, excited to provide more detail on [OSS' computing devices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAagBi_j4cA&amp;ab_channel=InsideHPCReport) in self-driving vehicles.\n\nSo what is a PCIe? The PCIe is the motherboard site that interfaces with a computer's graphics cards, hard drive adapter, SSDs, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet hardware connections. In June 2020, OSS introduced the [world\u2019s first](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2051412/0/en/OSS-Introduces-World-s-First-PCIe-Gen-4-Expansion-System-for-NVIDIA-A100-PCIe-GPUs.html#:~:text=(Nasdaq%3A%20OSS)%2C%20a,20X%20over%20the%20previous%20generation) PCIe Gen4 Expansion System that fully supports NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, which can boost computing performance up to 20X over the previous generation. The OSS Gen4 Expansion System allows system developers to scale out almost any Gen4 server by adding up to eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The system is ideal for boosting the performance of compute-intensive applications like **AI training, AI inference, video analytics and XR rendering**. What is XR rendering? X is just a placeholder! Virtual, Mixed, or Augmented reality (VR, MR, or AR, respectively) experiences include those where users generate new forms of reality by bringing digital objects into the physical world and those that see the bringing physical world objects into the digital world. Yes, OSS also powers augmented reality applications.\n\nINDUSTRY - is there growth to \u201cEdge Computing\u201d as a field? \n\n[MarketsandMarkets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/edge-computing-market-133384090.html#:~:text=Edge%20computing%20can%20be%20used,%2C%20healthcare%2C%20and%20many%20others) projects the global edge computing market to grow from **$3.6 billion in 2020 to $15.7 billion by 2025**, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 34.1% during the forecast period. Factors such as the growing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) across industries; rising demand for low-latency processing and real-time, automated decision-making solutions; and a need for surmounting exponentially increasing data volumes and network traffic.\n\nPARTNERSHIPS\n\nOSS is diversified in its partnerships with the big boys - Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, and [many others](https://www.onestopsystems.com/partners).\n\nMEAT AND POTATOES - finances \n\nFollowing IPO in 2018, OSS already generates $60 million in revenue, increasing 45% YOY. \n\nHow about its market share? To find a company\u2019s size, or \u201cmarket cap,\u201d multiply the current share price by the number of shares. OSS clocks in with 16,620,000 shares x $7.91 = 131M. For a company with a 130M market cap, $60M in revenue represents very strong revenue (46%) to its size. For comparison\u2019s sake, NVDA market cap is 335B and generates 16.7B annually (5%). With 31% institutional ownership \u2013 and [increasing](https://fintel.io/so/us/oss) \u2013 this is certainly on the radar of the big players.\n\nA note about earnings per share (EPS) - OSS\u2019 earnings announcement is coming between March 19 and 25. Based on two analyst forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.04 with 12.17M revenue. Indeed, OSS has quickly transformed itself into a profitable enterprise with [consistent revenue beats](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OSS/earnings) to boot. \n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nIn short, OSS has 40M in assets, 11M in liabilities and 2M total debt. \n\n*Processing img 0357jvc0uok61...*\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nFormerly the interim head, now-CEO [David Raun](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/25/2053412/0/en/OSS-Appoints-David-Raun-Technology-Industry-Veteran-as-President-CEO.html) has two decades of experience in the PCIe area, and led PLX Technology to record revenue and profits before getting acquired by Broadcom (AVGO).\n\nCOMPETITORS\n\nForget the stellar partnerships, what about the competition? Within the well-differentiated industry of Hardware, Storage, and Peripherals are 40 companies ranging from Apple to Ricoh. The direct competitor to watch for is Supermicro (SMCI). SMCI, however, makes no mention of cloud-readiness in its press release (coincidentally publicized merely hours after OSS, on the very same day - nervous, perhaps?). \n\nOn the other hand, the OSS 4UV can connect almost any Gen 4 server to eight A100 PCIe GPUs and two NICs, also offering a complete NVIDIA GPU **cloud-ready solution** with the OSS 4UV pre-installed in an OSS 2U-EOS-4a Gen 4 server.\n\nOFFERING\n\nPremarket Tuesday, March 2nd, OSS announced a 1.5M share offering to an institutional investor. Remarkably, OSS showed strength into the mid-morning, after opening at $7.56 it hit a high of $8.79 before succumbing to general market weakness and closing at $7.91, down 11% (see daily chart below). A green candle the day after an offering? Sounds like a great dip to buy. \n\nTECHNICALS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tf412r4quok61.jpg?width=1522&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d061155dc969bb6663af3fd38c9d1014ed799264\n\nVolume has been readily coming in. A stock that previously traded around 40k volume is now averaging big volumes, over 1M+ daily. What happened? I think institutions are beginning to catch on. Currently above the 5, 20, and 50 moving averages, OSS bounced nicely off the 20 MA during a big intra-day rally (40%+) on March 1st, 2021 hitting a fresh 52-week high of $9.50 without apparent news. \n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nInvestors should ask the question, \"where could this company be in 2 to 3 years?\" With OSS, we have a case study in a profitable company meeting big revenue expectations relatively soon after IPO, invaluable partnerships, military contracts, and anticipatory growth in the industry and beyond.\n\nPOSITIONS: I am in for 1300 shares at $8.60.",

Market participants continue to focus on the Treasury yields, a new coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and additional stimulus from Washington. \n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we\u2019ll have a robust and ultimately complete \\[economic\\] recovery.\u201d Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell\u2019s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.

Both stocks saw their share price spike due to high retail buying interest (predominantly due to significant social media activity) and an options based gamma squeeze.

        "selftext": "I intentionally removed the symbol from the charts because I want beginners to focus on the method, not the actual trade. My market bias is neutral to slightly bullish for the next few weeks so I want a strategy that matches that market forecast (bullish put spread). I want a stock that has heavy volume, relative strength and a breakout through resistance. I will sell the bullish put spread below technical support and that short strike price is my stop (a close below that level). If the SPY closes below the 50-day MA I will also consider closing the spread. I am staying near term because I want to make sure that I can take advantage of accelerated time decay and selling below the 1 SD will also increase my odds for success. In this case I have to put up the difference in the strike prices less the credit received or $2.00 ($2.50 - $.50). My return is 25% ($.50/$2.00) in 3 weeks if the spread expires.\n\nHere are more details and the supporting charts. I hope this process helps those of you who are starting to trade options.\n\n  \n\n1. I am looking for a bullish search\n\n2. I want a stock that is moving higher on heavy volume when the market is down.\n\n3. The stock has broken through horizontal resistance and it bounced off of that support. \n\n4. The stock has a nice up trend that lends support at $232.50 (short strike)\n\n5. The stock is through the downward sloping trend line and this looks like a bullish flag formation\n\n6. The $232.50/230 bullish put spread is 1 standard deviation OTM. \n\n7. The stock is strengthening vs SPY\n\n8. The stock is up when the SPY is down and it has been able to hold its opening gap up. \n\n9. The stock is strong relative to the SPY on 5 min chart\n\n10. The earnings date is after the options expiration. \n\n11. Spread is $.40 x $.70. I feel a $.50 credit is likely to fill. You have to put up $2.00 in margin to make $.50 in the next 3 weeks.

        "selftext": "**TL;DR** \\- Alternative miners are not being evaluated by the market accurately based upon 2022 earnings estimates and indicates significant upside potential.  See link for attached 2022 price estimates, the YOLO, and supplementary information.  This is not financial advise and do your own research prior to any investments. \n\nLink: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WODEN1j1YhF\\_vQdHCBZvrB-vC9U6AkNyBQgKTQ9RLcQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WODEN1j1YhF_vQdHCBZvrB-vC9U6AkNyBQgKTQ9RLcQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**For those of you word-readers:** \n\nIt appears that Bloomberg is trying to push a narrative that WSB is super interested in alternative miners based on one of their more recent articles.  I haven't seen any DD on this topic on WSB personally, so I figure let's help them out and discuss why alternative miners are not being evaluated properly by the market as a whole!  \n\n**What is an \"Alternative Miner?\"**\n\nAn alternative miner is a company that owns a large number of specialized computers, referred to as \"miners\".  These miners are used to create markets and verify transactions for digital currencies, and are rewarded set amounts of digital currencies for a successful verification in addition to any fees or spread in a purchase.  The primary costs for any alternative miner is the cost to purchase the mining computers, the cost to power the mining computers, and to pay for employees to monitor and repair any equipment.  \n\n**How have alt miner stocks been trading and why?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sqy6j0fox2n61.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e2f3fca2fbc41ee45478ae61524e7465f71b6bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hs7ydrh7y2n61.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9a78d3f7ee4d33890cb034b43683623b148ba09\n\nAs shown by the charts above, miners have had a hell of a run starting in November of 2020 all the way to now.  However, the share prices have been highly volatile, with companies in this space seeing drawdowns of 40% or more multiple times during this bull run.  Overall, the prices have been following the cost of the underlying asset they are mining, with large spikes when the asset it up and declines when it is down.  While the miners are following the asset, they have significantly outperformed thus far this year, shown by the table below.  Thus, my thought is that the market is viewing these miners as beta plays for the underlying assets and not evaluating the potential profitability and cash flows of these businesses. \n\n*Processing img eh9hmbdo53n61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Getting into the numbers - Marathon Digital ($MARA):**\n\n(Note - all tables below are shown in the following link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WODEN1j1YhF\\_vQdHCBZvrB-vC9U6AkNyBQgKTQ9RLcQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WODEN1j1YhF_vQdHCBZvrB-vC9U6AkNyBQgKTQ9RLcQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nNow, I am a bit of an old school guy, and I still think the best way to value businesses is to see the amount of earnings or cash the firm produces and compare it to similar companies to see if it is under or overvalued.  I'll be going over the numbers for Marathon Digital, as it is the company in the space I have the most experience with.  For this walkthrough, I'm going to be looking at 2022 earnings, as the company is still in the process of receiving and installing a large number of miners.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2rremv6f3n61.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d14c84426b7473c30daa0498565a5636dee5ac53\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ok - where did you come up with these numbers and what do they mean?**\n\nIn the table above, I have put down my estimates for the company in 2021 based upon a number of assumptions:\n\n* Revenues:  At the start of 2022, Marathon will have 103,000 s19 Antminers that will be mining the  digital currency that it supports.  The revenue number anticipates the dollar value of the assets it mines based upon the anticipated average price of the digital currency in 2022.  However, knowing the industry is  competitive, I have reduced the efficiency of Marathon's miners by 33% to account for the miners of competitors coming online during 2021 and 2022.\n* Energy Costs:  Marathon is in an agreement with Beowulf Energy to purchase all 105 megawatts from the Hardin facility to power the 103k miners.  An agreed price of 2.8 cents per kilowatt hour allows Marathon to have some of the cheapest power for miners while competitors commonly pay 4-5 cents KWh and works itself out to energy costs to Marathon of $96M annually.\n* G&amp;A - As this company is computers mining, there are very limited G&amp;A expenses.  The 12M per year anticipates 2M in security costs, total salaries paid increasing by 100%, and other expenses of 4M each year.  Compared to 2019 G&amp;A of 3M, this is a very conservative outlook for the company.\n* Depreciation: The average life of a mining computer is 2 to 3 years depending on the amount of ventilation and temperature of the computers surroundings.  Marathon itself discounts the life of its computers at 2 years, which is slightly more pessimistic than the 2.5 expected years.\n* Thus boiling these numbers down, the company is extremely profitable and showcases a net margin (profit margin) of 43.5% and a P/E of 21 even if the digital asset falls to 30K.\n\n**That's cool, but why do I give a shit?  Aren't there a lot of profitable companies?**\n\nNot this profitable.  There are four companies that are in the market making / payment verification market that have this high of net margins: Visa, Mastercard, CME Group, and MarketAxess.  Current P/Es of all four companies have been pull and discounted by 8% to simulate the P/E ratios of these firms in 2022, which is done in order to compare Marathon in 2022 to these companies in 2022.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wva9gcucg3n61.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df10255d0fd0d6f635bfae7818c9342ee947d980\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow each of these companies trade at a premium to Marathon, with the lowest PE of the three (CME Group) still priced at a 50% premium to the digital miner.   This indicates to me that MARA would be significantly underpriced, even if the underlying were to fall 50% to the 30k range. \n\n**So then, what do you think this company should be valued at?** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kndnpesg3n61.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f850571ed15066ebc4a2eef4a58e400d664ae089\n\nFirst off, the value of this company is going to be heavily dependent on the price of the underlying asset, so I've been showing results when it is at a variety of different prices.  I'll go with the result that is closest to current price levels which is 50k.  Using this level, a market value of Marathon was calculated using a P/E ratio equal to the average of the four peers (48.17x) and using the P/E of the cheapest firm (32.99x).  These two market caps are then averaged and discounted back to 2021 and a price estimate for Marathon of $162.94, indicating a possible 300% upside for the name from the current price of $40.70.  \n\n**So you like the stock and you created a nice story for it - how big are you in?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f48msucyi3n61.png?width=866&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be92f4131113832e5899b48363854434ac7ab868\n\n**EVERYTHING.**  98% of all my investments (retirement &amp; personal investments) are in alternative miner equity or calls on alternative miners.

        "selftext": "Stocks rallied on Monday after a choppy day, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) closing at new record levels. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered some lost ground as market participants continue to balance optimism regarding economic growth against rising Treasury yields.\n\nLast week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.\n\nWashington\u2019s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to hover near one-year highs at 1.607%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, \u201cThe pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.\u201d \n\nRising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital in order to fuel their growth and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. \n\nSeveral countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca\u2019s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union\u2019s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.\n\nIn other news, Novavax (NVAX) recently announced [drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK showed the inoculation was 96.4% effective ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0)against the original strain of the coronavirus. Analyses also showed the vaccine was 86.3% effective against the variant of the coronavirus circulating in the UK, and 55.4% effective against the variant circulating in South Africa.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* General Electric\u2019s (GE) stock rallied more than 5% today after its worst week in around a year.\n* Volkswagen (VWAGY) plans to build half a dozen battery cell plants in Europe by 2030 to expand infrastructure for charging electric vehicles. \n* Tesla Inc. said Chief Executive Elon Musk has changed his title at the company to \"Technoking of Tesla,\" and Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn will have the title of \"Master of Coin.\" \n* The Chinese government wants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to sell some of its media assets, including the South China Morning Post, because of growing concerns about the technology giant\u2019s influence over public opinion in the country, according to Bloomberg who is citing a person familiar with the matter.\n* AMC finally gets to reopen in Los Angeles on Monday after nearly a year of shutdowns because of the pandemic.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price is written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes.\\*\\***\n* Adient (ADNT) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": " \n\nHello investors,\n\nI wanted to discuss three things today.\n\n**1) Lessons to be learned from the tech sell-off**\n\n**2) Is this the end of the growth stocks selloff?**\n\n**3) What happens from here?**\n\n**1) Lessons to be learned from the tech sell-off**\n\nA lot of the hottest names in the street sold off more than 50% in the past few weeks. Nasdaq sold off 12% from its intraday highs.\n\nIn this Market Commentary, I laid out reasons why I thought these trends were happening and how I'm positioned in this environment.\n\nI wanted to re-emphasize key lessons to keep in mind, which I alluded to here, as we are trading through these types of corrections.\n\n1. Don't lose your money (sounds obvious but please read my explanation in the hyperlink above.\n2. Learn from other people's mistakes but more importantly, from your mistakes.\n3. Mental discipline is key.\n\nI understand that some of you have just started investing in the markets this past year.\n\nLet me warn you upfront that these types of corrections are minimal pains compared to actual bear markets.\n\nI mean really, the recent corrections/recessions have been very short-lived. The longest correction in the past 3 years is 2 months. Take a look below.\n\n2020 recession, 2018 correction\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n2008 recession (\\~1.5 years)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nTech bubble (2.5 years)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nEarly 1980s (\\~ 2 years)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nMy point is that corrections and recessions are not short-lived all of the times. Imagine your favorite stock dropping 70% over a period of 2 years.\n\nThe reason why I bring it up? I want to reiterate the importance of balancing your hedges, if you are not a buy-and-hold investor. (more on hedges here)\n\nSo always keep in mind bear markets can be dragged longer than you experienced so far.\n\nAnother key lesson to keep in mind is stay invested, as long as your security selections are solid.\n\nI can't remember exactly what the stats are but it goes something along the lines of\n\n\"if you missed out 20 best trading days in the past 20 years, your annual returns go from 12% a year to 7% a year\"\n\n\\*Please don't quote me on the exact figures but you get my point.\n\nI don't need to go back too far to prove my point. Just look at the past few days.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you missed out on that huge gap up on 3/9/2021, you missed out a lot.\n\nKeep in mind corrections create great opportunities, but don't underestimate the length of the correction period.\n\n**My strategy, which doesn't work for everyone due to differences in risk tolerance, investing time period, and discipline, is to slowly buy into the dip in increments, and load up on existing hedges if I think the correction is headed deeper.** During this process, you'll be fighting lots of naysayers. Those who believe we are doomed for tech massacre. Those who think the days of growth stocks are over and now the value stocks will shine. Try to keep distractions out of your analysis and stay focused on your game.\n\n**2) Is this the end of the growth stocks selloff?**\n\nThe short answer is yes, more likely than not.\n\nAgain, I explained in this market commentary why I think this is a short-lived correction and it was probably good buying opportunity.\n\nNow, I want to prevent anyone from spending his/her life savings on stocks just yet.\n\nRemember this game is about probability. Do I think the other guy on the poker table is bluffing? Absolutely, at 80% probability. But it could very well be the case that he actually wasn't bluffing and has trip tens.\n\nMy point is that anything can happen and we need to think in probabilistic terms, not absolute terms.\n\nBased on a few technical indicators, it seems that the market is again heading for a bullish action but I'm not a huge believer in technicals so I give little weight to this sort of analysis.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you look at the above chart, you are seeing a consistent gap higher with high-lows and high-highs, meaning for each day, the low is higher than the previous low and the high is higher than previous high, commonly seen in an upward trending market.\n\nFurthermore, it bounced back from its 100d MA support level, with three straight-up days.\n\nI believe we are likely out of the woods but one or more events can turn things over in a matter of a day, which I will explain more below.\n\n**3) What happens from here?**\n\nI have repeatedly mentioned that the two key drivers of the markets right now are monetary and fiscal policies.\n\nTherefore, any shifts in tone regarding these two policies will cause major changes in trends.\n\nKey things to look at are FOMC meeting tomorrow (monetary policy) and Biden administration policies (fiscal policy).\n\nI'm partially afraid that the Fed officials may say something that'll upset the markets tomorrow.\n\nFor instance, if their dot plots indicate faster than expected rate hikes, that would certainly be bad for the markets.\n\nOr if JPow &amp; Co suddenly shifts his tone to a more hawkish one given the rising inflation expectations, the risk assets won't like that either.\n\nI am assigning low probabilities in either of those events happening, hence my view that the tech selloff is over, but it is a non-zero risk.\n\nWhat I am more concerned about is the fiscal policy.\n\nBiden administration is already considering tax hikes to fund deficits, specifically 28% corporate tax rates and higher tax rates for wealthy individuals.\n\nBased on how the risk assets have reacted to Trump administration's tax cuts, I believe it is likely that the risk assets will react negatively to the proposed tax policies.\n\nTo summarize, I am still bullish for the long run but that view will depend largely on how the monetary and fiscal policies change. The Fed has reassured us that they will be very patient in the inflation front so I'm not too worried on that front. I am more concerned how the Biden administration will wind-down its spending earlier than expected, but no one can know how that will play out.\n\nThe best we can do is to stay invested and monitor the developments as closely as possible, especially the FOMC meeting tomorrow.\n\nThank you for reading and please feel free to leave comments or feedback.\n\nIf you'd like to receive emails, please sign up through this link.\n\nCheers!",

The price has been going up and down for this period, and there has been a roughly 11% gain for the last 2 weeks.

        "selftext": "Never actually traded a PMCC so I'm a noob just thinking about possibilities here.\n\nSo to start off the standard PMCC I have seen is having a long call 6-12 months out deep itm and then selling a call 30-45 days out otm by some amount. Then collecting profits once your short-term call gains around 50% profit more or less depending on your preference. What I don't see a lot of emphasis on is the entry points. Know obviously you want a good entry point on the long call and using the SPY as an example wouldn't be too difficult. Waiting for it to come back down to the 200 MA would be a decent enough entry I think. As far as the short-term call I'm thinking why not try more of a day trade/swing trade approach. For example, a simple strategy would be watching the SPY RSI on the 1 hour chart and selling a call whenever the SPY is overbought and you see a little confirmation. This sometimes results in small moves and sometimes bigger moves so you have to be careful. This would allow you to trade on the nearest strike out with a week or so expiration which allows you to gain a significant amount of money on a move down (I assume). You would have to be very careful not to get assigned of course. I don't know much about closing positions on sold calls so I might be missing something here but it seems like if you pull this off correctly you could make back your premium on the long call after some trades and possibly more rather quickly compared to the strat of going 30-45 days out\n\nThis strategy would work even better with a regular CC since they are overall better and you would just be making profit not trying to make up for premium or time decay. Anyway, let me know if I'm missing something or do you think this could possibly be pulled off.",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello investors,\n\nI wanted to discuss three things today.\n\n**1) Lessons to be learned from the tech sell-off**\n\n**2) Is this the end of the growth stocks selloff?**\n\n**3) What happens from here?**\n\n**1) Lessons to be learned from the tech sell-off**\n\nA lot of the hottest names in the street sold off more than 50% in the past few weeks. Nasdaq sold off 12% from its intraday highs.\n\nIn this Market Commentary, I laid out reasons why I thought these trends were happening and how I'm positioned in this environment.\n\nI wanted to re-emphasize key lessons to keep in mind, which I alluded to here, as we are trading through these types of corrections.\n\n1. Don't lose your money (sounds obvious but please read my explanation in the hyperlink above.\n2. Learn from other people's mistakes but more importantly, from your mistakes.\n3. Mental discipline is key.\n\nI understand that some of you have just started investing in the markets this past year.\n\nLet me warn you upfront that these types of corrections are minimal pains compared to actual bear markets.\n\nI mean really, the recent corrections/recessions have been very short-lived. The longest correction in the past 3 years is 2 months. Take a look below.\n\n2020 recession, 2018 correction\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n2008 recession (\\~1.5 years)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nTech bubble (2.5 years)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nEarly 1980s (\\~ 2 years)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nMy point is that corrections and recessions are not short-lived all of the times. Imagine your favorite stock dropping 70% over a period of 2 years.\n\nThe reason why I bring it up? I want to reiterate the importance of balancing your hedges, if you are not a buy-and-hold investor. (more on hedges here)\n\nSo always keep in mind bear markets can be dragged longer than you experienced so far.\n\nAnother key lesson to keep in mind is stay invested, as long as your security selections are solid.\n\nI can't remember exactly what the stats are but it goes something along the lines of\n\n\"if you missed out 20 best trading days in the past 20 years, your annual returns go from 12% a year to 7% a year\"\n\n\\*Please don't quote me on the exact figures but you get my point.\n\nI don't need to go back too far to prove my point. Just look at the past few days.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you missed out on that huge gap up on 3/9/2021, you missed out a lot.\n\nKeep in mind corrections create great opportunities, but don't underestimate the length of the correction period.\n\n**My strategy, which doesn't work for everyone due to differences in risk tolerance, investing time period, and discipline, is to slowly buy into the dip in increments, and load up on existing hedges if I think the correction is headed deeper.** During this process, you'll be fighting lots of naysayers. Those who believe we are doomed for tech massacre. Those who think the days of growth stocks are over and now the value stocks will shine. Try to keep distractions out of your analysis and stay focused on your game.\n\n**2) Is this the end of the growth stocks selloff?**\n\nThe short answer is yes, more likely than not.\n\nAgain, I explained in this market commentary why I think this is a short-lived correction and it was probably good buying opportunity.\n\nNow, I want to prevent anyone from spending his/her life savings on stocks just yet.\n\nRemember this game is about probability. Do I think the other guy on the poker table is bluffing? Absolutely, at 80% probability. But it could very well be the case that he actually wasn't bluffing and has trip tens.\n\nMy point is that anything can happen and we need to think in probabilistic terms, not absolute terms.\n\nBased on a few technical indicators, it seems that the market is again heading for a bullish action but I'm not a huge believer in technicals so I give little weight to this sort of analysis.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you look at the above chart, you are seeing a consistent gap higher with high-lows and high-highs, meaning for each day, the low is higher than the previous low and the high is higher than previous high, commonly seen in an upward trending market.\n\nFurthermore, it bounced back from its 100d MA support level, with three straight-up days.\n\nI believe we are likely out of the woods but one or more events can turn things over in a matter of a day, which I will explain more below.\n\n**3) What happens from here?**\n\nI have repeatedly mentioned that the two key drivers of the markets right now are monetary and fiscal policies.\n\nTherefore, any shifts in tone regarding these two policies will cause major changes in trends.\n\nKey things to look at are FOMC meeting tomorrow (monetary policy) and Biden administration policies (fiscal policy).\n\nI'm partially afraid that the Fed officials may say something that'll upset the markets tomorrow.\n\nFor instance, if their dot plots indicate faster than expected rate hikes, that would certainly be bad for the markets.\n\nOr if JPow &amp; Co suddenly shifts his tone to a more hawkish one given the rising inflation expectations, the risk assets won't like that either.\n\nI am assigning low probabilities in either of those events happening, hence my view that the tech selloff is over, but it is a non-zero risk.\n\nWhat I am more concerned about is the fiscal policy.\n\nBiden administration is already considering tax hikes to fund deficits, specifically 28% corporate tax rates and higher tax rates for wealthy individuals.\n\nBased on how the risk assets have reacted to Trump administration's tax cuts, I believe it is likely that the risk assets will react negatively to the proposed tax policies.\n\nTo summarize, I am still bullish for the long run but that view will depend largely on how the monetary and fiscal policies change. The Fed has reassured us that they will be very patient in the inflation front so I'm not too worried on that front. I am more concerned how the Biden administration will wind-down its spending earlier than expected, but no one can know how that will play out.\n\nThe best we can do is to stay invested and monitor the developments as closely as possible, especially the FOMC meeting tomorrow.\n\nThank you for reading and please feel free to leave comments or feedback.\n\nIf you'd like to receive emails, please sign up through this link.\n\nCheers!",

        "selftext": "\n\nGood Morning,\n\nThe music to this post is **Diamond** by **Lorn.**  Put it on.\n\nI own 18 3/19 17.5 Calls and 41 15$ 4/16 Calls..\n\n**I am not a professional.**  None of my work or writing should be taken as any good reason to spend money on anything.  In fact taking my advice is like playing in traffic with your eyes shut.  I am currently writing this from the basement of an insane asylum where I work.  At least I think I work here... That's what they tell me anyways.\n\nI will have you know I am **UNCONCERNED** about the current share price.  It only offers a ticket to Valhalla or the kind of early retirement where you take a shit on your bosses desk.  In front of people.\n\nBefore we begin, I am going to say that yesterday's number mismatch was a bit of a let down.  We sourced the information from Yahoo Financial Services and we should have really thought that extraordinary claims required extraordinary evidence that the free float is 140mil not 14 mil. We were blinded by the light. Caught up in a deuce another runner in the night.   What is a deuce? That deuce is the things that we want to be there and so we don't ask questions that we should.   I promise you quality postings and hope to bring good tidings, like a bag of skittles in an MRE.  BTW, Why the fuck are you eating an MRE?\n\nPoser.\n\n**I am thankful that someone brought it up and with that said it is imperative that you check everyone's work.**\n\n**Good news -**\n\nu/Manpozi reports that **15920** Calls vs **1211** Puts were purchased yesterday for a 0.76 ratio.  73% at ask or between market and 41% at ask or above... This is (highly bullish).   Think about that.  For every 1 **Put** 7 calls were **bought**.  These numbers are sourced from ThinkOrSwim.\n\n[https://u.teknik.io/qXxmG.png](https://u.teknik.io/qXxmG.png)  \\- Ortex Stats\n\n**(Huffs Copium )** Look, compared to other SPACs Canoo is doing well.. **\\*cough Cough\\*** Tombstone Doji on the daily but whatever TA's for losers. **\\*cough cough\\***\n\n**Short Utilization** \\- 100\n\n**On Loan -** 7.29M\n\n**Short Interest** \\- 8.9 M\n\n**Cost to borrow** \\- 7.5\n\n**Average age on loan** \\- **19.74!!** this is up from 16.28\n\nWhat we can tell from this folks is that recent shorty covered some shares yesterday.  While this lessens the squeeze potential it does tell us that someone thinks we have reached the bottom and its up from here.  Don't worry there's plenty of shorting left to cover. But that's the hopium read.\n\nOr they are could just be reloading for today when we aren't on the SSR list... Premarket looks great just sayin....\n\n**Bad news -** Gamma Ramp is not psycho-tier just crazy cat lady who might be a meth head tier , Squarely ran around the mountain yesterday... The only good news about this would be if SI was accumulated to do so...\n\n**(TLDR: We thought the gamma ramp was a straight green dildo to heaven but it turned out just to be a really good one that gets the job done if there is the willingness to put in some elbow grease. Big Dicked Chads are betting more money that you will ever know that some shit is going to go down in the next few weeks )**\n\nAgain, Fuck TA Chads DD and that stands for the Deep Dive into our next section.  Shut the fuck up about it being longer than your attention span just comment some rocket emojis in solidarity and move on...\n\n# Why Canoo?\n\n**(CanooBros call me out if something needs to be changed)**\n\nI spoke with /u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  who frequents the arrr slash canoo reddit.  He enlightened me why people have diamond hands over this fucking pig of a stock and are really excited about it.  I get the feeling that the market does not yet understand what Canoo offers, perhaps they don't do a good job of explaining it.  He did, they should hire them as their hypeman.\n\nPlease see these images of some great DD he put together.  This actually might be some Gcup work here guys... [1](https://u.teknik.io/aiAXA.png),[2](https://u.teknik.io/RdPBe.png),[3](https://u.teknik.io/kVCdj.png),[4](https://u.teknik.io/UUIx0.png)\n\n/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  points to a COX Automotive study found [here](https://www.coxautoinc.com/learning-center/2018-mobility-study/).  The biggest argument is made that consumers are perceiving that the cost of ownership of a vehicle is too great as the cost of ownership rises Gen Z and millennials will be more open to different options. Bikes, Public Transportation or Ride share.  Canoo's subscription model seeks to capture this audience which allows them to own and operate a vehicle for a monthly price.  Should their needs or desires change they essentially turn them in, grab a different one or just do whatever.  Honestly I am a bit sold on this because of the efficiency of vehicles being in a pool of ownership that is flexible to the changes of demand.  Have a kid, get the mini-van.  Don't have kids... Don't get the minivan.  Feeling adventurous?  Get the Adventure van.  Want just something to take you around town.. Get the sedan.  This seems to align with 2021 mentality.  This is a game changer IMHO.\n\n/u/dramatic-trainer-268 also noted \"According to a recent [Mckinsey study, \"The New Realities of Premium Mobility,\"](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-new-realities-of-premium-mobility) 20% of the automotive retail market is forecast to be used for car sharing driven primarily by subscriptions and autonomous taxis by 2025. The exploding Battery Electric Vehicle (BEVs) market and transition to autonomous / connected-cars will lead that transformation. **When it comes to BEVs, 50% of consumers surveyed preferred a subscription model over traditional vehicle ownership, according to a January 2020 Capgemini report.** \"\n\nBut what about EV's in General.\n\nAnother [study](https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-COX-AUTOMOTIVE-EVOLUTION-OF-MOBILITY-THE-PATH-TO-ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-ADOPTION-STUDY.pdf) by COX titled Automotive Evolution of Mobility - The path to electric vehicle adoption.  Here is a link.  The study is decently high powered and covers 2503 consumers and 308 Dealers and was fielded in 03/2019.\n\n1. The results were that Most consumers believe that EVs are coming but dont want to buy one.\n2. Tesla has massive brand awareness.\n3. Barriers to adoption are price and charging capacity.  \\*\n4. Affordability is coming.\\*\n5. People think Cost of ownership is less. \\*\n6. Minimum Acceptable Range for EVs were 184 miles and they desired 300 which is on par with ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) \\*\n7. Dealers don't sell EVs, They perceive its not worth their effort. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe can see where Canoo can come in with the **\\*** and provide advantageous market position.\n\nThe B2B opportunities are just as generous.  We all know about the [Apple Canoo Article.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).. But do we know about the [Jack Ma talking to Canoo article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-alibaba-canoo-discussed-partnership-2020-10?op=1)?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.\n\nTheir Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.\n\nSpeaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.  [Canoo is Hiring in Fort Worth.](https://imgur.com/gallery/4tkCj44) Uber purchasing Canoo EVs sends the SP to 10 to the Power of Greyskull...\n\n/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  puts on a tin-foil hat and gets all excited.  \"***They keep telling us how much demand there is for their platform, and the MPDV is an objectively well designed, hyper functional, differentiated offering in it's segment of the market, seemed to be received really well, and now they come with a truck? Basically way ahead of schedule and seemingly out of the blue? Why? Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said \"can you get us the truck by then too?*****\"**\"\n\nHe just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further.\n\nSome people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?\n\nWhy am I breathing hard?\n\nI just got done moving some goalposts.\n\nWhat might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **\"We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.\"**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.  I hate to move the goal posts but well... that's why I bought April Calls... Just saying.\n\nThis shit is wild.\n\nStay Frosty",

        "selftext": " This analysis looks at one possible break-up scenario of the Rite Aid corporation that projects a return of more than 2X the closing share price of $22.55 on Wednesday, March 10, 2021.\n\nRite Aid (RAD) consists of two (2) parts:\n\n1. The Retail Pharmacy business currently generating approximately $16 billion in annual revenues.\n2. The Prescription Benefits Management (PBM) services business known as ELIXIR, currently generating approximately $8 billion in annual revenues.\n\nOne possible scenario for unlocking the value of RAD involves the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business and Rite Aid brand. What is left is the ELIXIR PBM organization. Here is an estimation of how such an approach might play out:\n\n* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. That represents an average price of $2.275 million per store.\n* Should RAD seek a buyer for its Retail Pharmacy business, it could sell its 2,450 remaining stores as well as the Rite Aid brand. Despite the fact that many of these stores are located in highly attractive locations (CA, OH, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, VA, etc), let's discount the average value of each store by 20% (compared to the average price-per-store paid by Walgreens), and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $1.8 million per store.\n* At a average price of $1.8 million per store, RAD could reasonably generate proceeds of $4.4 billion with the sale of the entire Retail Pharmacy business, including the 2,450 locations and the Rite Aid brand name (assigning no good will value to the brand).\n* The remaining RAD organization essentially consists of a PBM branded as ELIXIR and a net amount of cash on hand of +$1.2 billion, assuming that $3.2 billion of the Retail Pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing long-term debt on the company's books.\n* ELIXIR's projected sales for RAD's fiscal year 2021 (ending February 2021) are approximately $8 billion. During each of the past four (4) quarters, RAD has reported ELIXIR's year-over-year growth rate to be in the range of 23 - 29%.\n* ELIXIR's projected EBITDA for fiscal 2022 (begining March of 2021) will likely be approximately $200 million. Once again, I am taking a conservative estimate, and basically considering that a business that has grown 23 - 29% each quarter for the past year, will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year.\n* With only 55,000,000 shares outstanding today, the $200 million EBITDA generated by ELIXIR translates to roughly $3.60 per share in earnings. Using a highly conservative PE multiple of 8, a stock price of $28.80 results. However, the cash-on-hand of $1.2 billion (from the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business after long-term debt payoff) produces additional value of $22.00 per share, resulted in a stock price value of more than $50 per share (which is more than 2X the closing price of $22.55 on Wednesday, March 10, 2021).\n* The newly created company, ELIXIR, would be well-positioned for growth in the small-to-mid-size opportunity segment of the $400 billion per year PBM industry. With a net $1.2 billion in cash, that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition.\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis indicates that the conservative value of RAD today is $50 per share, well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market, which is just over $22.50.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the Rite Aid corporation is the best strategic path forward. (I personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $100 in the next 12 - 24 months if it keeps the entire organization fully in tact.) Rather, the purpose of the post was to reveal the hidden value locked within RAD that is clearly being overlooked by the investment community, by analyzing one possible break-up scenario.",

        "selftext": "After a steep pullback in the last couple of weeks, stocks roared back Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq recording its best day since April 2020. The move marked a stark reversal after the index sank into a correction by the close of Monday's session, plunging a total of more than 10% from a recent record closing high. Goes to show how volatile the market can be. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.42% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.10% up.\n\nThe sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant\u2019s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. \n\nThe Treasury yield pulled back a little but remains at elevated levels, which was pressuring equity markets, particularly tech stocks, in recent weeks. . Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. \n\nCourtney Dominguez, Payne Capital Management Senior Wealth Advisor said, \u201cThis is a trend that tends to happen as we get out of a recession: You tend to see stocks move towards cyclical. So things like value companies or small caps, things like energy, tend to do really well when you\u2019re coming out of a recession. And what happened last year is, those tech companies were really doing so well that their prices were getting extremely high. I don\u2019t think these companies are going away. I think a lot of these are going to be things that we continue to have in our workplaces going forward. But the question is, are these companies so expensive, is all the optimism already priced in?\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden\u2019s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Gamestop (GME) performed strongly again today, rising around 25% at the time of writing.\n* Roblox is set to go public tomorrow via direct listing, ticker will be RBLX. Unlike a traditional IPO the company isn\u2019t raising new capital via the offering, instead holders are selling stock they already own.\n* Walt Disney Co.'s flagship streaming service, Disney+, has surpassed 100 million subscribers in its first 16 months of operation, the company announced today.\n* After cratering in value in recent weeks, EV stocks like NIO and Tesla (TSLA) came roaring back today! It was Tesla\u2019s best day since 2013, up around 19% at the time of writing\n* Twitter (TWTR) and Square (SQ) boss Jack Dorsey said on Tuesday he will convert proceeds from the digital auction of the first-ever tweet on the platform to bitcoin for charity. His first tweet sold as a non-fungible token for $2.5 million\n* **Please note current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes.**\n* Ambarella (AMBA) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target around $135 at Buy. Stock currently around $106\n* Clean Harbors (CLH) target raised by Needham &amp; Co from $104 to $107 at Buy.

Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not risk, but it is an opportunity. Where else do you look for cheap stocks?\" - Li Lu (Had to reuse the quote, so valuable considering how stocks rallied today)",

        "selftext": "# [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzd9js/goev_the_bull_case_of_canoo_inc_aka_goev_aka/)\n\n# [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0nkgk/goev_the_bull_case_of_canoo_inc_aka_goev_aka/)\n\nGood Morning,\n\nThe music to this post is **Diamond** by **Lorn.**  Put it on.\n\nI own 18 3/19 17.5 Calls and 41 15$ 4/16 Calls..\n\n**I am not a professional.**  None of my work or writing should be taken as any good reason to spend money on anything.  In fact taking my advice is like playing in traffic with your eyes shut.  I am currently writing this from the basement of an insane asylum where I work.  At least I think I work here... That's what they tell me anyways.\n\nI will have you know I am **UNCONCERNED** about the current share price.  It only offers a ticket to Valhalla or the kind of early retirement where you take a shit on your bosses desk.  In front of people.\n\nBefore we begin, I am going to say that yesterday's number mismatch was a bit of a let down.  We sourced the information from Yahoo Financial Services and we should have really thought that extraordinary claims required extraordinary evidence that the free float is 140mil not 14 mil. We were blinded by the light. Caught up in a deuce another runner in the night.   What is a deuce? That deuce is the things that we want to be there and so we don't ask questions that we should.   I promise you quality postings and hope to bring good tidings, like a bag of skittles in an MRE.  BTW, Why the fuck are you eating an MRE?\n\nPoser.\n\n**I am thankful that someone brought it up and with that said it is imperative that you check everyone's work.**\n\n**Good news -**\n\nu/Manpozi reports that **15920** Calls vs **1211** Puts were purchased yesterday for a 0.76 ratio.  73% at ask or between market and 41% at ask or above... This is (highly bullish).   Think about that.  For every 1 **Put** 7 calls were **bought**.  These numbers are sourced from ThinkOrSwim.\n\n[https://u.teknik.io/qXxmG.png](https://u.teknik.io/qXxmG.png)  \\- Ortex Stats\n\n**(Huffs Copium )** Look, compared to other SPACs Canoo is doing well.. **\\*cough Cough\\*** Tombstone Doji on the daily but whatever TA's for losers. **\\*cough cough\\***\n\n**Short Utilization** \\- 100\n\n**On Loan -** 7.29M\n\n**Short Interest** \\- 8.9 M\n\n**Cost to borrow** \\- 7.5\n\n**Average age on loan** \\- **19.74!!** this is up from 16.28\n\nWhat we can tell from this folks is that recent shorty covered some shares yesterday.  While this lessens the squeeze potential it does tell us that someone thinks we have reached the bottom and its up from here.  Don't worry there's plenty of shorting left to cover. But thats the hopium read.\n\nOr they are could just be reloading for today when we aren't on the SSR list... Premarket looks great just sayin....\n\n**Bad news -** Gamma Ramp is not psycho-tier just crazy cat lady who might be a meth head tier , Squarely ran around the mountain yesterday... The only good news about this would be if SI was accumulated to do so...\n\n**(TLDR: We thought the gamma ramp was a straight green dildo to heaven but it turned out just to be a really good one that gets the job done if there is the willingness to put in some elbow grease. Big Dicked Chads are betting more money that you will ever know that some shit is going to go down in the next few weeks )**\n\nAgain, Fuck TA Chads DD and that stands for the Deep Dive into our next section.  Shut the fuck up about it being longer than your attention span just comment some rocket emojis in solidarity and move on...\n\n# Why Canoo?\n\n**(CanooBros call me out if something needs to be changed)**\n\nI spoke with /u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  who frequents the arrr slash canoo reddit.  He enlightened me why people have diamond hands over this fucking pig of a stock and are really excited about it.  I get the feeling that the market does not yet understand what Canoo offers, perhaps they don't do a good job of explaining it.  He did, they should hire them as their hypeman.\n\nPlease see these images of some great DD he put together.  This actually might be some Gcup work here guys... [1](https://u.teknik.io/aiAXA.png),[2](https://u.teknik.io/RdPBe.png),[3](https://u.teknik.io/kVCdj.png),[4](https://u.teknik.io/UUIx0.png)\n\n/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  points to a COX Automotive study found [here](https://www.coxautoinc.com/learning-center/2018-mobility-study/).  The biggest argument is made that consumers are perceiving that the cost of ownership of a vehicle is too great as the cost of ownership rises Gen Z and millennials will be more open to different options. Bikes, Public Transportation or Ride share.  Canoo's subscription model seeks to capture this audience which allows them to own and operate a vehicle for a monthly price.  Should their needs or desires change they essentially turn them in, grab a different one or just do whatever.  Honestly I am a bit sold on this because of the efficiency of vehicles being in a pool of ownership that is flexible to the changes of demand.  Have a kid, get the mini-van.  Don't have kids... Don't get the minivan.  Feeling adventurous?  Get the Adventure van.  Want just something to take you around town.. Get the sedan.  This seems to align with 2021 mentality.  This is a game changer IMHO.\n\n/u/dramatic-trainer-268 also noted \"According to a recent [Mckinsey study, \"The New Realities of Premium Mobility,\"](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-new-realities-of-premium-mobility) 20% of the automotive retail market is forecast to be used for car sharing driven primarily by subscriptions and autonomous taxis by 2025. The exploding Battery Electric Vehicle (BEVs) market and transition to autonomous / connected-cars will lead that transformation. **When it comes to BEVs, 50% of consumers surveyed preferred a subscription model over traditional vehicle ownership, according to a January 2020 Capgemini report.** \"\n\nBut what about EV's in General.\n\nAnother [study](https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-COX-AUTOMOTIVE-EVOLUTION-OF-MOBILITY-THE-PATH-TO-ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-ADOPTION-STUDY.pdf) by COX titled Automotive Evolution of Mobility - The path to electric vehicle adoption.  Here is a link.  The study is decently high powered and covers 2503 consumers and 308 Dealers and was fielded in 03/2019.\n\n1. The results were that Most consumers believe that EVs are coming but dont want to buy one.\n2. Tesla has massive brand awareness.\n3. Barriers to adoption are price and charging capacity.  \\*\n4. Affordability is coming.\\*\n5. People think Cost of ownership is less. \\*\n6. Minimum Acceptable Range for EVs were 184 miles and they desired 300 which is on par with ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) \\*\n7. Dealers don't sell EVs, They perceive its not worth their effort. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe can see where Canoo can come in with the **\\*** and provide advantageous market position.\n\nThe B2B opportunities are just as generous.  We all know about the [Apple Canoo Article.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).. But do we know about the [Jack Ma talking to Canoo article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-alibaba-canoo-discussed-partnership-2020-10?op=1)?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.\n\nTheir Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.\n\nSpeaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.  [Canoo is Hiring in Fort Worth.](https://imgur.com/gallery/4tkCj44) Uber purchasing Canoo EVs sends the SP to 10 to the Power of Greyskull...\n\n/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  puts on a tin-foil hat and gets all excited.  \"***They keep telling us how much demand there is for their platform, and the MPDV is an objectively well designed, hyper functional, differentiated offering in it's segment of the market, seemed to be received really well, and now they come with a truck? Basically way ahead of schedule and seemingly out of the blue? Why? Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said \"can you get us the truck by then too?*****\"**\"\n\nHe just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further.\n\nSome people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?\n\nTo move some goal posts what might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **\"We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.\"**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.  I hate to move the goal posts but well... that's why I bought April Calls... Just saying.\n\nThis shit is wild.\n\nStay Frosty",

        "selftext": "Coupang (CPNG) didn\u2019t get as much hype as PLTR or more recently, RBLX. However, it\u2019s impossible to ignore this amazing investment opportunity. Upon doing more research, CPNG has insane growth prospects, with a stellar management team, a delivery infrastructure that improves upon what AMZN has, and proven dominance in a hyper-competitive market, CPNG is $$$.   \n\n\n**What does it do:**  \n \\-CPNG is an e-commerce company based in South Korea. \n\n\\-Unlike Amazon, CPNG has the biggest private fulfillment ecosystem in the world. This means they have more control over how they deliver: They offer free same-day delivery on retail products, and deliver food and drinks from local businesses as well. They don\u2019t rely on a UPS or Fedex, for example, as they have their own fleet of delivery drivers. \n\n\\-Their \u201cDawn Delivery\u201d service runs overnight. Returns are free and instant. No packaging or re-boxing is necessary, and money is returned to the customer as soon as the item is scanned. \n\n\\-They\u2019re eco-friendly, using 75% less boxes than Amazon.\n\n\\-Market Cap: About 100-billion. 2020 Revenue was $12-bn. Has grown over 90% from 2019.   \n\n\n**Competitors:**  \n\\-The two dominant e-commerce companies in Korea are G-Market and Coupang. Koreans overwhelmingly prefer Coupang and well over 25-million, or half the entire population has downloaded the app.\n\n\\-CPNG CEO routinely compares their performance against AMAZN and Ebay. In the future perhaps.  \n\n\n**But . . . South Korea?**  \n \\-South Korea is the 5th largest e-commerce market in the world and is projected to be the 3rd largest E-commerce market after China and the US in the next 5-10 years. \n\n\\-Also, Coupang will EXPAND. They\u2019re quiet about it now, but they have offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Silicon Valley, and Seattle. They plan to expand throughout Asia and the United States. \n\n\\-It\u2019s realistic, because South Korea is like the Switzerland of Asia. Due to Korea\u2019s relatively neutral political history, many Asian countries don\u2019t have any qualms working with Korea vs. say China or Japan. \n\n\\-Its why Samsung, K-pop, BTS etc. have penetrated the global market post-2010s in ways that Chinese and Japanese companies haven\u2019t. \n\n\\-Coupang is projected to be the leading company in Korea, but will likely take market share in the US, China, South East Asia, and South America.   \n \n\n**Notable Investors:**  \n\\-Bill Ackman - Said it was one of his BEST ventures to date.\n\n\\-Softbank - has helped Coupang be the biggest Asian IPO since Alibaba. Masa Son believes this to be a long-term play.\n\n\\-Blackrock  \n \\-Sequoia Capital  \n\n\n**Intangibles:**  \n\\-A charismatic CEO boosts sentiment. I bought Alibaba at 90 purely on Jack Ma\u2019s charisma. I bought TSLA at 260 (sold too early) purely because of Elon Musk.  \n\n\\-I grew up in South Korea. CPNG\u2019s CEO, Bom Kim, is the most articulate, and innovative CEO I\u2019ve ever seen to come out of South Korea. This guy is cut above every CEO I\u2019ve seen in Korea\u2014and he has the pump artist way of talking, if you know what I mean. This guy will say he \u201ccares about his customers\u201d and mean it, but deep down inside, he wants investors to make a lot of money. I know it when I see them. People like Musk, Ma, Jensen Huang, and now, this guy. \n\n\\-Look at this video and you\u2019ll know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. \n\n\\-Bom Kim is Korean born, but grew up in the US. He dropped out of Harvard after just 6-months (As a Korean, you have to be a psycho or really believe in your company to do that). Bom interned at BCG, then started a magazine company before started Coupang around 2010. \n\n\\-Kim\u2019s motto: I envision a world where people will say, \u201cHow could I have ever lived without Coupang\u201d.   \n\n\n**Future Direction:**  \n\\-They bought a major streaming company and will thus stream content (like Amazon Prime). \n\n\\-They will further expand and improve upon their food delivery service.\n\n\\-They will expand into new territories as early as next year (see above). \n\nDisclosure: I bought 500 shares today, with shares now averaging around $55. Of course I should've waited, but I've tended to do well buying close to open anyway. I plan to sell covered calls against at least two or three lots, as the premiums will be very juicy once the options market opens.  \n\n\n**Predictions:**   \n\\-My price prediction is as meaningless as a magic 8-ball, but my gut tells me this will touch $70-$80 by eoy, and $150+ within two years depending on macro factors and their improving fundamentals.\n\n\\-Also, I admit, this is a bit foolish to predict rn (but I wanna take credit if it happens lol): I\u2019d be surprised if Cathie Wood doesn\u2019t buy CPNG. She has a team analyzing E-commerce companies and is knee deep in Shop. I\u2019m willing to bet she will buy CPNG some point soon because it is \"disruptive.\"  \n\n\n**TL;DR - As South Korea is projected to become the 3rd largest E-commerce market in the world, CPNG has proven to be he nation\u2019s most technologically savvy and dominant e-commerce platform. The stable-genius, well-spoken, Harvard-dropout CEO, Bom Kim has ambitions to grow Coupang into the largest e-commerce company in a world that\u2019s increasingly warming up to South Korean companies and culture.**",

I'm too dumb to know what that's about but it makes my bumhole pucker.\n\nFurther, if the merger went ahead one APHA share is worth 0.83 TLRY shares post merger. If you were to take the view that these legal issues are not an issue at all, APHA is still the better option.

In fact taking my advice is like playing in traffic with your eyes shut.  I am currently writing this from the basement of an insane asylum where I work.  At least I think I work here... That's what they tell me anyways.\n\nI will have you know I am **UNCONCERNED** about the current share price.  It only offers a ticket to Valhalla or the kind of early retirement where you take a shit on your bosses desk.  In front of people.\n\nBefore we begin, I am going to say that yesterday's number mismatch was a bit of a let down.  We sourced the information from Yahoo Financial Services and we should have really thought that extraordinary claims required extraordinary evidence that the free float is 140mil not 14 mil. We were blinded by the light. Caught up in a deuce another runner in the night.   What is a deuce? That deuce is the things that we want to be there and so we don't ask questions that we should.   I promise you quality postings and hope to bring good tidings, like a bag of skittles in an MRE.  BTW, Why the fuck are you eating an MRE?\n\nPoser.\n\n**I am thankful that someone brought it up and with that said it is imperative that you check everyone's work.**\n\n**Good news -**\n\nu/Manpozi reports that **15920** Calls vs **1211** Puts were purchased yesterday for a 0.76 ratio.  73% at ask or between market and 41% at ask or above... This is (highly bullish).   Think about that.  For every 1 **Put** 7 calls were **bought**.  These numbers are sourced from ThinkOrSwim.\n\n [https://u.teknik.io/qXxmG.png](https://u.teknik.io/qXxmG.png)  \\- Ortex Stats\n\n**(Huffs Copium )** Look, compared to other SPACs Canoo is doing well.. **\\*cough Cough\\*** Tombstone Doji on the daily but whatever TA's for losers. **\\*cough cough\\***\n\n**Short Utilization** \\- 100\n\n**On Loan -** 7.29M\n\n**Short Interest** \\- 8.9 M\n\n**Cost to borrow** \\- 7.5\n\n**Average age on loan** \\- **19.74!!** this is up from 16.28\n\nWhat we can tell from this folks is that shorty covered yesterday.  While this lessens the squeeze potential it does tell us that someone things we have reached the bottom and its up from here.  Don't worry there's plenty of shorting left to cover.  \n\nOr they are just reloading for today when we aren't on the SSR list/ \n\n**Bad news -** Gamma Ramp is not psycho-tier just crazy cat lady who might be a meth head tier , Squarely ran around the mountain yesterday... The only good news about this would be if SI was accumulated to do so...\n\n**(TLDR: We thought the gamma ramp was a straight green dildo to heaven but it turned out just to be a really good one that gets the job done if there is the willingness to put in some elbow grease. Big Dicked Chads are betting more money that you will ever know that some shit is going to go down in the next few weeks )**\n\nAgain, Fuck TA Chads DD and that stands for the Deep Dive into our next section.  Shut the fuck up about it being longer than your attention span just comment some rocket emojis in solidarity and move on...\n\n# [Why Canoo](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_965/wp1ny0u99xitjwttmhq8.png)?\n\n**(CanooBros call me out if something needs to be changed)**\n\nI spoke with /u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  who frequents the arrr slash canoo reddit.  He enlightened me why people have diamond hands over this fucking pig of a stock and are really excited about it.  I get the feeling that the market does not yet understand what Canoo offers, perhaps they don't do a good job of explaining it.  He did, they should hire them as their hypeman.\n\nPlease see these images of some great DD he put together.  This actually might be some Gcup work here guys... [1](https://u.teknik.io/aiAXA.png),[2](https://u.teknik.io/RdPBe.png),[3](https://u.teknik.io/kVCdj.png),[4](https://u.teknik.io/UUIx0.png)\n\n/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  points to a COX Automotive study found [here](https://www.coxautoinc.com/learning-center/2018-mobility-study/).  The biggest argument is made that consumers are perceiving that the cost of ownership of a vehicle is too great as the cost of ownership rises Gen Z and millennials will be more open to different options. Bikes, Public Transportation or Ride share.  Canoo's subscription model seeks to capture this audience which allows them to own and operate a vehicle for a monthly price.  Should their needs or desires change they essentially turn them in, grab a different one or just do whatever.  Honestly I am a bit sold on this because of the efficiency of vehicles being in a pool of ownership that is flexible to the changes of demand.  Have a kid, get the mini-van.  Don't have kids... Don't get the minivan.  Feeling adventurous?  Get the Adventure van.  Want just something to take you around town.. Get the sedan.  This seems to align with 2021 mentality.  This is a game changer IMHO.\n\n/u/dramatic-trainer-268 also noted \"According to a recent [Mckinsey study, \"The New Realities of Premium Mobility,\"](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-new-realities-of-premium-mobility) 20% of the automotive retail market is forecast to be used for car sharing driven primarily by subscriptions and autonomous taxis by 2025. The exploding Battery Electric Vehicle (BEVs) market and transition to autonomous / connected-cars will lead that transformation. **When it comes to BEVs, 50% of consumers surveyed preferred a subscription model over traditional vehicle ownership, according to a January 2020 Capgemini report.** \"\n\nBut what about EV's in General.\n\nAnother [study](https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-COX-AUTOMOTIVE-EVOLUTION-OF-MOBILITY-THE-PATH-TO-ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-ADOPTION-STUDY.pdf) by COX titled Automotive Evolution of Mobility - The path to electric vehicle adoption.  Here is a link.  The study is decently high powered and covers 2503 consumers and 308 Dealers and was fielded in 03/2019.\n\n1. The results were that Most consumers believe that EVs are coming but dont want to buy one.\n2. Tesla has massive brand awareness.\n3. Barriers to adoption are price and charging capacity.  \\*\n4. Affordability is coming.\\*\n5. People think Cost of ownership is less. \\*\n6. Minimum Acceptable Range for EVs were 184 miles and they desired 300 which is on par with ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) \\*\n7. Dealers don't sell EVs, They perceive its not worth their effort. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe can see where Canoo can come in with the **\\*** and provide advantageous market position.\n\nThe B2B opportunities are just as generous.  We all know about the [Apple Canoo Article.](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).. But do we know about the [Jack Ma talking to Canoo article](https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-alibaba-canoo-discussed-partnership-2020-10?op=1)?  No you didn't did you...  Everyone wants a piece of that ass and Canoo is being silent about it all.  Do you really think Amazon is going to ask tesla to develop their electric delivery vans?  Get real.\n\nTheir Skateboard platform is actually pretty cool.  Skateboard's are not new and Canoo was not the only company to develop one.  (Looking at you Moon Rover, if you even exist.) GM dropped its skate board commercial during the Superbowl.  Hyandai has a skateboard, is it Canoo's or is it theirs? No one knows.  But what makes Canoo versatile is that it can be the B2B driver of supreme customizability and its fly-by-wire technology allowing you to put the steering wheel anywhere.  Bangbus might actually be a thing. It would allow quick designs, on the fly remodeling and easy design to rubber meeting the road.  These sorts of quick turnarounds provide leverage in negotiations as it reduces premarket costs and improves first mover advantage.\n\nSpeaking of BangBus, UBER, as I have said before, is located in Dallas.  [Canoo is Hiring in Fort Worth.](https://imgur.com/gallery/4tkCj44) Uber purchasing Canoo EVs sends the SP to 10 to the Power of Greyskull...\n\n/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268  puts on a tin-foil hat and gets all excited.  \"***They keep telling us how much demand there is for their platform, and the MPDV is an objectively well designed, hyper functional, differentiated offering in it's segment of the market, seemed to be received really well, and now they come with a truck? Basically way ahead of schedule and seemingly out of the blue? Why? Why would they push the sedan release and move up the truck release?***  ***Obviously a ton of possibilities, but one obvious one would be: they determined that there is a larger, more robust market for the truck than they'd initially anticipated. And three months on the heels of the MPDV reveal, it wouldn't shock me in the slightest if some fleet buyer who was interested in the delivery van said \"can you get us the truck by then too?*****\"**\"\n\nHe just put a great post together detailing his his theory of what we can read into thursday's truck reveal. Please check out his profile to read further. \n\nSome people are a bit a bit more bearish on the Thursday reveal.  The argument is that MPG is a limited group of people and won't have much impact on stock price.  The truck might have some bearing on B2B delivery sales sure but will anyone really pay attention?\n\nTo move some goal posts what might be revolutionary will be q4 and 20202 Earnings that which will clearly define revenue and launch Canoo Inc. into the post revenue marketplace.  The only date I can find is a screen shot of someone emailing Canoo IR asking them when is earnings and their reply is **\"We haven't announced a date yet but expect it to be near the end of march.\"**  Canoo could drop some big big things that again would cause the revaluation immediately, distance it from other SPACS and put some hair on its chest.  I hate to move the goal posts but well... that's why I bought April Calls... Just saying.\n\nThis shit is wild.\n\nStay Frosty",
