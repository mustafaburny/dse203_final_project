        "selftext": "I'm working towards 1-5 yrs profit, so long term stock. Atm my portfolio contains DIS, SWKS, SQ, AMD, TWTR, INCY and NIO. To be clear, for example DIS is about 22% of my portfolio, NIO is 5%.\n\nToday I bought DAL and next week, I'll try to buy MA or V for a big amount. Leaves my account at 850 to spend from 8000. I looked at GILD for 68 rate, but they went up like 13% this week, don't think they'll come close again. Was also checking MRVL at 20.50, but they've also risen 11-12%.\n\nI think my portfolio is already pretty diverse, but any advice on a missing opportunity?\n\nAlso, do you have any tips on MA or V? Atm, I just have a target price for both of them and which one reaches it first is the one I will buy.",
