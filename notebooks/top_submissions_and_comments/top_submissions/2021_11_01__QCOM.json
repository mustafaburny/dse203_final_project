        "selftext": "I\u2019ve made and continue to make mistakes trading options, but every mistake makes me better and helps ensure I take a step back and don\u2019t get complacent. I\u2019ve committed to posting regularly to save others the pain of losing if I can and to help cement what I\u2019ve learned in my own head. I hope this post helps. It\u2019s not at all meant to show off, as I\u2019ve traded sideways in this IRA account for several months now, but recently changed strategies and they are working despite a little pull backs the past couple days. \n\n**Buying &amp; Selling Pfizer**\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of headlines about Pfizer lately, most of it very good news. So it\u2019s not surprising that the stock has been moving up. But it\u2019s wildly undervalued in my opinion. Prior to Covid, the stock was trading around $38 per share with about 50B in revenue. Last quarter alone they did $24B in revenue with sales boosted by the vaccine sales. Not only will this revenue trend continue, but they will be adding capacity to sell 21 million doses of the Covid-19 oral therapy next year at $700 a dose. That\u2019s another $15B of revenue. \n\nThe naysayers think these sales figures are short-lived or will wane quickly with the virus, but to this I say two things: first, it doesn\u2019t matter, money is money. Second, they are not accounting for the fact that 90 governments have already stepped forward to begin purchasing and stockpiling these pills to avoid the sort of supply chain issues everyone was having when the vaccines first appeared. So even if no one takes the pills, they will be purchased and stored. The U.S. has already ordered \u201cmillions\u201d of the anti-viral pills. \n\nPfizer expects vaccine sales of 36B in 2021 and 29B in 2022. Add to that the anti-viral pills and they are going to be hitting $44B in covid drugs next year - that\u2019s the entire revenue of previous years and does not count any sales from their other products. Now, they do share revenue with BioNTech, so we need to discount the vaccine sales by half, but that still equates to almost $30B more revenue next year.\n\nTo the naysayers that argue this revenue is short-lived: we don\u2019t yet know that is true as this virus has proven to be tricky and it\u2019s likely the covid shot is the new annual flu shot, as was the case with swine flu. More importantly, the profit from these drugs will fuel a major acquisition spree. They can go buy their next blockbusters without R&amp;D risk.\n\nSo what am I doing about all this? I bought 30 Jan23 options contracts $40 strike when Pfizer dipped last month. I sold 10 last week for a 100% gain. I\u2019m going to ride the remaining 20 up to a price target of $65 a share. I will pick up more on any major selloffs. \n\n**I Loaded Up on CROX**\n\nI can\u2019t say enough good things about this stock, which I have been trading for a couple years now because I don\u2019t like holding through the volatility. The short version is, they are absolutely killing it and despite initial concerns about potential knock offs and rubber shortages, people continue to stay brand loyal and buy them up. When you walk down the street and see half the kids wearing them, you know they have done something amazing with their brand. And they financials show it: \n\n425% earnings growth\n\n73% revenue growth\n\n65% gross margin (incredible)\n\nP/E of 15\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to find bargains in this market, but when CROX pulled back in October, I bought some 2023 calls when the price rose above 140 (because I could tell the momentum was under it then). It\u2019s hanging around 174 right now and normally I would have exited but because of my past trades of getting out a little early, I sold my original investment and am going to hang on to the rest until the stock crosses 200.  \n\n**I Bought On QualComm\u2019s Buyback**\n\nOn Oct 12th, I got an alert from my favorite new system, LevelFields, that QualComm would be buying back $10B worth of stock aka 7% of the company at the time. IMHO there is no stronger signal to the market of a company\u2019s financial health than a buyback. It means, typically, that the leadership is so confident in the market position, sales, cash flow, and economic environment that they\u2019d rather repurchase stock than spend more money to grow revenues or save for a rainy day. \n\nWhen the buyback occurs before earnings are out, it\u2019s a good sign it\u2019s going to be a blockbuster earnings report. When the news hit, the stock was trading at 122/share. Sure enough, when earnings came out in November, they crushed it. Record revenue, beat earnings consensus by 13% ($2.55/share), and upped guidance revenue going forward. \n\nI bought the Jan 2023 calls at a 140 strike price and intend to hold them until the stock reaches 200. \n\nThe stock hit 170 recently and had a bit of a pullback on what appears to be profit taking and inflation worries.\n\nThere\u2019s some volatility ahead but I will hold through the chop this time because the company is on the right path and the analysts are all calling for 185-204 ranges. \n\n**I Bought and Sold Puts on Pullbacks** \n\nA strategy I\u2019ve grown to love is selling puts towards the end of a pullback on stocks I want to own. I did this for Visa after its earnings sell-off at the end of October. Now, I have owned Visa since its IPO and the position has grown quite large over time so I\u2019ve been trimming it over the years and now look for ways to profit from trading it. Headed into earnings, I suspected a good chance of a pullback and got ready to sell the dip. \n\nAs expected, it sold off, got hit with a government antitrust investigation, and tumbled some more. On the government investigation news, I sold puts on it when it had fallen 10% down to the 210 level and raked in the premiums. \n\nI like using Fidelity\u2019s options analyzer to help ensure the puts I\u2019m selling fall outside at least one standard deviation from expected price movements. It\u2019s one of the more helpful ways of visualizing where to aim.\n\nI also bought puts on Visa prior to earnings at the money for one week out with an order to sell once I hit a $10,000 profit. It sold off in a few hours and I got the Fidelity notification I had just made $10,000 in a day while making lunch. \n\nThere are some more trades I made, but I\u2019m out of time for writing today so hopefully can come back to those another time (UPST, INMD, UCTT, CELH).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[25&amp;#37; in cash, 75&amp;#37; invested in this account for effective return of 36&amp;#37; until the recent pullback](https://preview.redd.it/tn38hd19nyy71.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12693a0d345ce0838452cfb8f0e7f5ba893a8af5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xen04fvhnyy71.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb6614d4f6e2a30e69f53e81f09cd6242683c6d",

        "selftext": "Hi fellow retards, been a fellow lurker for a few years now but decided to post because I recently shifted my stance on $INTC and figured I should get the full smooth-brain experience by getting roasted by my fellow apes.  \n\nI figured Intel was done for ever since they stopped making significant progress on their chip performance and neglected their foundry, and was on the AMD hype-train ever since Ryzen 2 launched. However, a lot has changed on the global stage and on Intel\u2019s strategy which signals a new outlook for Intel in the next year. \n\nFirst of all, Intel has seen the writing on the wall. They have gotten sloppy and greedy for too long and have seen their bottom line and image hit the shitter. In response, they have started hiring the talent they need to get their foundry and R&amp;D back on track. They recently hired [Vineet Goel](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-hires-top-amd-gpu-architect-to-lead-xe-ip-roadmap) from AMD to work on GPU architecture, and have hired a slew of [veterans and new talent](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16807/intel-continues-to-rehire-veterans-at-some-point-theyll-run-out) as part of their revamping and have finally started to [move in the right direction](https://www.pcworld.com/article/549611/intel-core-i5-12600k-review.html/amp). Intel definitely sees how they\u2019ve lost their edge to AMD and NVIDIA and are making sure they hire the right talent to turn the tide. They also have deeper pockets than AMD and NVIDIA to make sure this happens (34.6B vs just 3.6B and 7.7B respectively). \n\nOn the other hand, the political stage has completely shifted, and China and the US are more than just on bad footing, as the FBI officially note that . [china is \u201ca threat to our economic security\u2014and by extension, to our national security\u201d](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states). As a result, the US government is currently in a race to decouple as quick as possible from china, and no decoupling is more important than that of the chip-manufacturing industry. \n\nThere is only 1, US-based chip manufacturer, and if you\u2019re also smooth brained, you likely know it\u2019s INTEL. Everyone else just designs in the US and manufactures in Asia, which is an issue because the next big player, TSMC is increadibly close to getting rammed by China because china want\u2019s to [take over Taiwan](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-11-03/china-clearly-developing-ability-to-invade-taiwan-top-general-says). This leaves the US government as well as the  entire private industry up in the air if and when China invades Taiwan (or even just makes shipping to/from Taiwan harder). \n\nYou know who has deeper pockets than Intel? The DoD and they\u2019ve basically decided that Intel has to be the leader for the sake of the entire private industry and US national security ([see here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-wins-us-project-develop-foundry-ecosystem.html#gs.f1t2zi).\n\nIntel will be a big mover going forward because they want to win, the US government needs them to step up their game, and cash is clearly not and will not be an issue. More importantly, Intel is going to be more than just a cpu vendor, they are likely going to be the main foundry for most american chip designers like AMD, Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm",

        "selftext": "**BULL CASES**\n\n/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.\nYes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.\n\n/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.\n\n/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.\n\nFor reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).\n\n/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.\nWhich would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.\n\n/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.\n\n/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.\n\n/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. \n\nHowever, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.\n\n*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*\n\n/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.\n\n/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.\n\n/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.\n\n/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.\n\n/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?\n\n/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.\n\n**Bear Cases**\n\n/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.\n\n/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.\n\n/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.\n\n/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.\n\n/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.\n\n[positions or ban. bought 100 shares for now. will be selling some puts to enter into more. And then around the next earnings, will buy some calls](https://imgur.com/a/xxYyDIE)",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 4, 2021**\n\nThe good times keep on rolling! The remarkable rally in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued, which each index recording fresh intraday highs the day after the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing as the US economy reaches the \u201csubstantial progress\u201d benchmark outlined by the Fed back in December 2020.\n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nSpecifically, the Fed said it would begin reducing its asset purchases this month by a total of $15 billion, and then by another $15 billion in December, but said the outlook for the pace of tapering in the future would depend on \"changes in the economic outlook.\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell also reiterated his prior stance that the ultimate end of the tapering process next year would not automatically signal the start to interest rate hikes. \n\nNew weekly jobless claims came at a fresh pandemic-era low, with further improvements in the labor market coming as companies continue to compete to attract and retain workers amid elevated demand. New jobless claims came in at the lowest level since March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended October 30:** 269,000 vs. 275,000 expected and a revised 283,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims, week ended October 23:** 2.105. million vs. 2.147 million expected and a revised 2.239 million during prior week \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* NVIDIA (NVDA), my absolute favorite stock in the market, was on fire today, up double digit gains to cross $300 for the first time and topping $750 billion. This is the next $1 trillion stock IMO. The surge happened due to Wells Fargo raising price target $330, citing the metaverse as a major growth contributor\n* According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) are working out how quickly the rental car company can receive its 100,000 cars delivered\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/hertz-will-have-to-wait-for-teslas-just-like-other-buyers-11636028622?st=pgmbhcmxarriey5\\&amp;amp;reflink=article\\_copyURL\\_share](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hertz-will-have-to-wait-for-teslas-just-like-other-buyers-11636028622?st=pgmbhcmxarriey5&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share)\n\n* Ford Motor (F) said it plans to retire up to $5 billion in high-interest debt and tap into the fast-growing market for \"green\" bonds to help it finance new electric vehicles and expand credit to customers with lower scores.\n* Britain could speed up a move to make the executives of big techs firm criminally liable for harmful content on their platforms if they do not take action to tackle the problem, Digital Minister Nadine Dorries told lawmakers on Thursday.\n* Google is pursuing a massive cloud-computing contract with the Department of Defense, nearly three years after abandoning a similar bid process in the face of employee protests.\n* Google said on Thursday it plans to allow third party payment systems in South Korea in order to comply with a new law that bans major app store operators from forcing software developers to use their payments systems.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Albemarle (ALB) target raised by Oppenheimer from $296 to $307 at Outperform.

A positive outlook from semiconductor giant Qualcomm contributed to evidence that the industry's squeeze is lessening. Short-maturity Treasury yields fell as global investors reviewed the future for monetary policy after the Bank of England defied expectations by leaving interest rates unchanged.\n* The decision came after weeks of speculation that the BoE would be the first major central bank to boost borrowing costs since the pandemic began.

        "selftext": "Welcome to the weekend update!\n\nAnother great week (as expected)! We leveraged up at the bottom and have been unloading into the predicted rally. Portfolios are still strongly biased towards a continued upmove but the current leverage was reduced to 1.5/1.6. Meaning a 10% move should make us 15-16% overall (it goes both ways). That's why taking profits is king. Those were the profits taken this week.\n\n\nDD +15% (3 trading days)\n\nQCOM +21.2% (18 trading days)\n\nEXPE +8.3% (5 trading days)\n\nGE +9.4% (34 trading days)\n\nSBUX +4.7% (19 trading days)\n\nLeveraged ETFs:\n\n30% of URTY +33% (now I only own 30% of the initial position)\n\nBut let's cut to the chase: Portfolios are up 49 and 40% year to date while the best performing US Index is up 27% (NDX100). An international benchmark mix (60% US) is only up 17.8% because Brazil and Asia were tanking again.\n\nAs always there is no way to post charts on reddit/stocks so I will explain what I see!\n\nNDX100: It all started with the extremely low MACD readings late September and October. I had posted that it was a buying opportunity. Obviously laughed at by redditors but I like being attacked and laughed at because that means chances are I am right. Around that time investor sentiment was net negative 4 weeks in a row. Just 1 year after a recession that is a buying opportunity! Anyhow. NDX100 made 14% since the low and broke above the highs from early September. Because many were left behind we went up in a straight line!\nAs long as we can stay above the breakout area of 15700 we will continue to go higher. Expect a test of the area around 15700 but the minimum target should be 17000. If we make it in a straight line or not depends on how much FOMO all the bears from September have.\nI am a swing trader so I already took a profit of 15% on TQQQ. The main reason was to deleverage on the way up.\n\nDisclaimer: I own QQQ, FB, Amazon longterm. \n\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 15700\n\nDJI: Same is true for DJI as for NDX100. Watch the 35500 level. I also realized already a 13.8% profit on UDOW. \nMinimum target 37250.\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 35500\n\n\nS&amp;P500: Watch 4550 level. Also broke above and confirmed bullish bias. Minimum target 4800.\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 4550\n\n\nRussell 2000: Russell 2000 is my favorite US Index right now and the only index I still own leveraged ETFs on. It had a rough 2021 trading in a trading range for at least 8 months but it finally woke up and it could run at least 10% from here still. This week alone it made 6%. I predicted the Russell to outperform NDX, S&amp;P, DJI until end of year and I still think more money can be made with small caps.\nFor deleveraging purpose I had sold another 30% of URTY. Gain was 33%.\nMinimum target 2580 but will likely go much higher.\n\nDisclaimer: I own IWM and URTY plus many individual small cap stocks that were sold off brutally into October.\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish above 2360 area.\n\nSpecialty Indices:\n\nToday I mention one specialty Index that I think has potential\n\nXBI (Biotech):\nBiotech had a rough time for months now but came back big time breaking a months long downtrend. It hit the 200 day average and is in the middle of retesting that broken downtrendline. XBI could be a buy from here.\n\nDisclaimer: I own LABU (leveraged ETF on XBI). Up 14% as of today.\n\nIf you are only interested in US investments stop here!\n\n\nInternational plays.\n\nFEZ: Eurostoxx had a great comeback like the US Indices and also made new highs after months of sideways action. Minimum target is the 51.5 are or FEZ\n\nDisclaimer: I own FEZ and DB\n\n\nChina (FXI): China is in the middle of a medium-/longterm bottoming phase. It retraced the recent upmove by a little bit more than 61.8%. It could turn any time here. If we really break down to the 37.5 level again it is definitely a buying opportunity.\n\nDisclaimer: I am currently overweight the regular 10% allocation to Asia\n\nOutlook short-/medium term: Bullish although choppy because we are in the middle of a bottoming phase (only index I think is in a longterm bottoming phase)\n\n\nSpeculative:\n\nBrazil: I had mentioned last week that Brazil was in dire straights!\n\nHere is the article again:\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/markets-reeling-brazil-deficit-fears-005715131.html\n\nI speculated that like with the Evergrande disaster it might be worth looking at trading opportunities here.\n\nBrazil was sold off with high volume 10-21 and a hammer formed with higher volume 10-22. We were in the middle of retracing the 10% upmove last week. Dropped below the 61.8% retracement but made a double bottom at 29. Friday's candle needs to be be confirmed but I think it has potential. I bought more call options around the $29 area.\n\nExtremely dangerous situation.\n\nDisclaimer: 7-9% of my portfolios are call options on EWZ\n\nOutlook: Possible bottoming phase. Highly speculative.\n\n\n\nOverall positioning:\n\nTime in the market is key and therefore I am almost always 100% invested. This way you get the skeptics out of the way and really don't miss out on opportunities.\n\nHowever timing the market CAN absolutely be done. One can beat the benchmark without ever being out of the market with margin loans, leveraged ETFs and options trading by finding bottoms. My specialty is finding bottoms. The maximum leverage at the lows early October was 3. Now portfolios are at 1.5/1.6 and the goal is to unleverage on the way up to a goal of 1 again when we are closer to a neutral/bearish signal.\n\nThere is a good possibility that a huge rally internationally just started but because one never knows for sure we will continue to unload our positions because we are still overleveraged due to the fact that we anticipated the bottom about 1 month ago and loaded up on stocks then.\n\n\nHappy to discuss as usual. Just post in comment section.\n\nHappy Trades and have a great weekend and trading week!\nGo out there and make money with the tip of your finger!\n\nSee you next week.\nChart-trader",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, November 4th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&amp;P 500\u2032s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.\n*****\n&gt; Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.\n*****\n&gt; Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%\n*****\n&gt; And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth,\u201d said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program \u201clater this month.\u201d This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus it\u2019s provided since the pandemic took hold.\n*****\n&gt; The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of today\u2019s meeting, which is why we aren\u2019t seeing a \u2018taper-tantrum 2.0,\u2019\u201d said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[W]e\u2019re coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,\u201d said Oanda\u2019s Craig Erlam. \u201cThe economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week\u2019s number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.\n*****\n&gt; October\u2019s hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday. Consensus estimates call for 450,000 jobs added, according to Dow Jones. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, far short of the 500,000 estimate.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/csr94jX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xNBnRQj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fohWsiA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/dimSvYo.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/oImlOeJ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TnV9F9e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/f2OW6wj.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/2psSyZE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5P5LNw4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RrVCnQY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/k3dndoN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/WhuthuY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/XIdGKfq.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TOMORROW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5kgHYBl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jSIcjQk.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/VqyLZlv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/INro3Hf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/2GtTG34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5EXfeNk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/9QaOqLA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rVxlcYW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aG5Jy73.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/u4uclmF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-regeneron-planet-fitness-viacomcbs-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)** \u2013 The drug maker\u2019s shares rallied 2.7% in the premarket after it reported a significant beat on both the top and bottom lines for its latest quarter.

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 4, 2021**\n\nThe good times keep on rolling! The remarkable rally in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued, which each index recording fresh intraday highs the day after the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing as the US economy reaches the \u201csubstantial progress\u201d benchmark outlined by the Fed back in December 2020.\n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nSpecifically, the Fed said it would begin reducing its asset purchases this month by a total of $15 billion, and then by another $15 billion in December, but said the outlook for the pace of tapering in the future would depend on \"changes in the economic outlook.\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell also reiterated his prior stance that the ultimate end of the tapering process next year would not automatically signal the start to interest rate hikes. \n\nNew weekly jobless claims came at a fresh pandemic-era low, with further improvements in the labor market coming as companies continue to compete to attract and retain workers amid elevated demand. New jobless claims came in at the lowest level since March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended October 30:** 269,000 vs. 275,000 expected and a revised 283,000 during prior week\n* **Continuing claims, week ended October 23:** 2.105. million vs. 2.147 million expected and a revised 2.239 million during prior week \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* NVIDIA (NVDA), my absolute favorite stock in the market, was on fire today, up double digit gains to cross $300 for the first time and topping $750 billion. This is the next $1 trillion stock IMO. The surge happened due to Wells Fargo raising price target $330, citing the metaverse as a major growth contributor\n* According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) are working out how quickly the rental car company can receive its 100,000 cars delivered\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/hertz-will-have-to-wait-for-teslas-just-like-other-buyers-11636028622?st=pgmbhcmxarriey5\\&amp;amp;reflink=article\\_copyURL\\_share](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hertz-will-have-to-wait-for-teslas-just-like-other-buyers-11636028622?st=pgmbhcmxarriey5&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share)\n\n* Ford Motor (F) said it plans to retire up to $5 billion in high-interest debt and tap into the fast-growing market for \"green\" bonds to help it finance new electric vehicles and expand credit to customers with lower scores.\n* Britain could speed up a move to make the executives of big techs firm criminally liable for harmful content on their platforms if they do not take action to tackle the problem, Digital Minister Nadine Dorries told lawmakers on Thursday.\n* Google is pursuing a massive cloud-computing contract with the Department of Defense, nearly three years after abandoning a similar bid process in the face of employee protests.\n* Google said on Thursday it plans to allow third party payment systems in South Korea in order to comply with a new law that bans major app store operators from forcing software developers to use their payments systems.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Albemarle (ALB) target raised by Oppenheimer from $296 to $307 at Outperform.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, November 4th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&amp;P 500\u2032s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.\n*****\n&gt; Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.\n*****\n&gt; Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%\n*****\n&gt; And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth,\u201d said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program \u201clater this month.\u201d This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus it\u2019s provided since the pandemic took hold.\n*****\n&gt; The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of today\u2019s meeting, which is why we aren\u2019t seeing a \u2018taper-tantrum 2.0,\u2019\u201d said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[W]e\u2019re coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,\u201d said Oanda\u2019s Craig Erlam. \u201cThe economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week\u2019s number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.\n*****\n&gt; October\u2019s hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday.

        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading month of November and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise more than 150 points as November begins with investors betting on a year-end rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures posted a strong gain in early morning trading Monday as investors bet on a year-end rally after markets navigated a typically tough seasonal period successfully.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 185 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Tesla, which became a $1 trillion company last week, continued its gains for the year with shares up another 2.8% in premarket trading. Investors have been piling into bets on Tesla options as of late.\n*****\n&gt; Shares linked to an economic recovery, such as Ford and Occidental Petroleum, where also indicated higher in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view, the key story arc driving equities is the strengthening global recovery,\u201d wrote Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday. \u201cCOVID-19 trends are improving, but with vaccinations and boosters, the improvement in healthcare risk could materially accelerate in 2022.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; After a tough September where the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 4%, the benchmark jumped nearly 7% last month. September is typically the worst month for the market, averaging a 0.4% decline since 1950, according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac. The market typically averages a gain in October, but the month is known for notable crashes so investors were a bit wary as the month began.\n*****\n&gt; But stocks ended up closing out October on Friday with all three major averages closing at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq clinched their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.8% in October. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 6.9% last month and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 7.3% in October.\n*****\n&gt; For the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 22%.\n*****\n&gt; Corporate earnings season dominated October amid solid profit results even with global supply chain concerns. About half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results and more than 80% of them beat earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Market participants are gearing up for another week of corporate earnings, a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and October\u2019s jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings season continues this week, investors will also be monitoring the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be looking for the Fed\u2019s comments on rising prices as inflation has been running at a 30-year high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will get a look at the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index for October, which is expected to fall to 60.3 from September\u2019s 61.1. Any number above 50 is considered expansion.\n*****\n&gt; The other big event for the week will be October\u2019s employment report Friday, which could show some improvement in hiring, as new cases of Covid-19 continued to decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to show an increase of 450,000 after September\u2019s meager 194,000 gain, with the unemployment rate edging down to 4.7%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cKey to the report will be how much wage inflation rises and whether the labor force participation rate finally picks up after so many recently came of extended unemployment benefits,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/WXTnY3e.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/xic6dLX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($ON $PCG $CRNT $TRVG $AMG $CNA $ALX $SXC $TKR $JELD $LDI $OIS $ENBL $BEN $WTRG $SBT $CHT $AKTS)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/F75otQF.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/z21eWxD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/aO8d0Fs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/mtCexr5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/fj3byrA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tTxuJf8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OLOoH6Y.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* LCID\n* FSR\n* MVST\n* GEVO\n* BITF\n* XPEV\n* ORGN\n* NIO\n* LRC.X\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-harley-davidson-spotify-trivago-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Harley-Davidson (HOG)** \u2013 The motorcycle maker\u2019s shares soared 9.4% in the premarket after the U.S. and the European Union ended a dispute involving steel and aluminum tariffs.

        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading month of November and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise more than 150 points as November begins with investors betting on a year-end rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures posted a strong gain in early morning trading Monday as investors bet on a year-end rally after markets navigated a typically tough seasonal period successfully.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 185 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Tesla, which became a $1 trillion company last week, continued its gains for the year with shares up another 2.8% in premarket trading. Investors have been piling into bets on Tesla options as of late.\n*****\n&gt; Shares linked to an economic recovery, such as Ford and Occidental Petroleum, where also indicated higher in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view, the key story arc driving equities is the strengthening global recovery,\u201d wrote Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday. \u201cCOVID-19 trends are improving, but with vaccinations and boosters, the improvement in healthcare risk could materially accelerate in 2022.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; After a tough September where the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 4%, the benchmark jumped nearly 7% last month. September is typically the worst month for the market, averaging a 0.4% decline since 1950, according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac. The market typically averages a gain in October, but the month is known for notable crashes so investors were a bit wary as the month began.\n*****\n&gt; But stocks ended up closing out October on Friday with all three major averages closing at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq clinched their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.8% in October. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 6.9% last month and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 7.3% in October.\n*****\n&gt; For the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 22%.\n*****\n&gt; Corporate earnings season dominated October amid solid profit results even with global supply chain concerns. About half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results and more than 80% of them beat earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Market participants are gearing up for another week of corporate earnings, a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and October\u2019s jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings season continues this week, investors will also be monitoring the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be looking for the Fed\u2019s comments on rising prices as inflation has been running at a 30-year high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will get a look at the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index for October, which is expected to fall to 60.3 from September\u2019s 61.1. Any number above 50 is considered expansion.\n*****\n&gt; The other big event for the week will be October\u2019s employment report Friday, which could show some improvement in hiring, as new cases of Covid-19 continued to decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to show an increase of 450,000 after September\u2019s meager 194,000 gain, with the unemployment rate edging down to 4.7%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cKey to the report will be how much wage inflation rises and whether the labor force participation rate finally picks up after so many recently came of extended unemployment benefits,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/WXTnY3e.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/xic6dLX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($ON $PCG $CRNT $TRVG $AMG $CNA $ALX $SXC $TKR $JELD $LDI $OIS $ENBL $BEN $WTRG $SBT $CHT $AKTS)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/F75otQF.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/z21eWxD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/aO8d0Fs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/mtCexr5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/fj3byrA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tTxuJf8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OLOoH6Y.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* LCID\n* FSR\n* MVST\n* GEVO\n* BITF\n* XPEV\n* ORGN\n* NIO\n* LRC.X\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-harley-davidson-spotify-trivago-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Harley-Davidson (HOG)** \u2013 The motorcycle maker\u2019s shares soared 9.4% in the premarket after the U.S. and the European Union ended a dispute involving steel and aluminum tariffs.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, November 4th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&amp;P 500\u2032s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.\n*****\n&gt; Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.\n*****\n&gt; Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%\n*****\n&gt; And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth,\u201d said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program \u201clater this month.\u201d This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus it\u2019s provided since the pandemic took hold.\n*****\n&gt; The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of today\u2019s meeting, which is why we aren\u2019t seeing a \u2018taper-tantrum 2.0,\u2019\u201d said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[W]e\u2019re coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,\u201d said Oanda\u2019s Craig Erlam. \u201cThe economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week\u2019s number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.\n*****\n&gt; October\u2019s hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday. Consensus estimates call for 450,000 jobs added, according to Dow Jones. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, far short of the 500,000 estimate.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/csr94jX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xNBnRQj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fohWsiA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/dimSvYo.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/oImlOeJ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TnV9F9e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/f2OW6wj.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/2psSyZE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5P5LNw4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RrVCnQY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/k3dndoN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/WhuthuY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/XIdGKfq.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TOMORROW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5kgHYBl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jSIcjQk.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/VqyLZlv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/INro3Hf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/2GtTG34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5EXfeNk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/9QaOqLA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rVxlcYW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aG5Jy73.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/u4uclmF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* DKNG\n* SKLZ\n* EVAX\n* ROKU\n* HIMX\n* CRO.X\n* PENN\n* MRNA\n* BTTX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-regeneron-planet-fitness-viacomcbs-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)** \u2013 The drug maker\u2019s shares rallied 2.7% in the premarket after it reported a significant beat on both the top and bottom lines for its latest quarter.

        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading month of November and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise more than 150 points as November begins with investors betting on a year-end rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures posted a strong gain in early morning trading Monday as investors bet on a year-end rally after markets navigated a typically tough seasonal period successfully.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 185 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Tesla, which became a $1 trillion company last week, continued its gains for the year with shares up another 2.8% in premarket trading. Investors have been piling into bets on Tesla options as of late.\n*****\n&gt; Shares linked to an economic recovery, such as Ford and Occidental Petroleum, where also indicated higher in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view, the key story arc driving equities is the strengthening global recovery,\u201d wrote Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday. \u201cCOVID-19 trends are improving, but with vaccinations and boosters, the improvement in healthcare risk could materially accelerate in 2022.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; After a tough September where the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 4%, the benchmark jumped nearly 7% last month. September is typically the worst month for the market, averaging a 0.4% decline since 1950, according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac. The market typically averages a gain in October, but the month is known for notable crashes so investors were a bit wary as the month began.\n*****\n&gt; But stocks ended up closing out October on Friday with all three major averages closing at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq clinched their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.8% in October. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 6.9% last month and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 7.3% in October.\n*****\n&gt; For the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 22%.\n*****\n&gt; Corporate earnings season dominated October amid solid profit results even with global supply chain concerns. About half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results and more than 80% of them beat earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Market participants are gearing up for another week of corporate earnings, a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and October\u2019s jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings season continues this week, investors will also be monitoring the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be looking for the Fed\u2019s comments on rising prices as inflation has been running at a 30-year high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will get a look at the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index for October, which is expected to fall to 60.3 from September\u2019s 61.1. Any number above 50 is considered expansion.\n*****\n&gt; The other big event for the week will be October\u2019s employment report Friday, which could show some improvement in hiring, as new cases of Covid-19 continued to decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to show an increase of 450,000 after September\u2019s meager 194,000 gain, with the unemployment rate edging down to 4.7%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cKey to the report will be how much wage inflation rises and whether the labor force participation rate finally picks up after so many recently came of extended unemployment benefits,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/WXTnY3e.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/xic6dLX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($ON $PCG $CRNT $TRVG $AMG $CNA $ALX $SXC $TKR $JELD $LDI $OIS $ENBL $BEN $WTRG $SBT $CHT $AKTS)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/F75otQF.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/z21eWxD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/aO8d0Fs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/mtCexr5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/fj3byrA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tTxuJf8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OLOoH6Y.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-harley-davidson-spotify-trivago-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Harley-Davidson (HOG)** \u2013 The motorcycle maker\u2019s shares soared 9.4% in the premarket after the U.S. and the European Union ended a dispute involving steel and aluminum tariffs.

        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading month of November and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, November 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise more than 150 points as November begins with investors betting on a year-end rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures posted a strong gain in early morning trading Monday as investors bet on a year-end rally after markets navigated a typically tough seasonal period successfully.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 185 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of Tesla, which became a $1 trillion company last week, continued its gains for the year with shares up another 2.8% in premarket trading. Investors have been piling into bets on Tesla options as of late.\n*****\n&gt; Shares linked to an economic recovery, such as Ford and Occidental Petroleum, where also indicated higher in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view, the key story arc driving equities is the strengthening global recovery,\u201d wrote Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday. \u201cCOVID-19 trends are improving, but with vaccinations and boosters, the improvement in healthcare risk could materially accelerate in 2022.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; After a tough September where the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 4%, the benchmark jumped nearly 7% last month. September is typically the worst month for the market, averaging a 0.4% decline since 1950, according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac. The market typically averages a gain in October, but the month is known for notable crashes so investors were a bit wary as the month began.\n*****\n&gt; But stocks ended up closing out October on Friday with all three major averages closing at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq clinched their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.8% in October. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 6.9% last month and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 7.3% in October.\n*****\n&gt; For the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 22%.\n*****\n&gt; Corporate earnings season dominated October amid solid profit results even with global supply chain concerns. About half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results and more than 80% of them beat earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Market participants are gearing up for another week of corporate earnings, a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and October\u2019s jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; As earnings season continues this week, investors will also be monitoring the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be looking for the Fed\u2019s comments on rising prices as inflation has been running at a 30-year high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. \u201cIn a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will get a look at the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index for October, which is expected to fall to 60.3 from September\u2019s 61.1. Any number above 50 is considered expansion.\n*****\n&gt; The other big event for the week will be October\u2019s employment report Friday, which could show some improvement in hiring, as new cases of Covid-19 continued to decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to show an increase of 450,000 after September\u2019s meager 194,000 gain, with the unemployment rate edging down to 4.7%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cKey to the report will be how much wage inflation rises and whether the labor force participation rate finally picks up after so many recently came of extended unemployment benefits,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/kID8drk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kpeo12w.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/WXTnY3e.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/xic6dLX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($ON $PCG $CRNT $TRVG $AMG $CNA $ALX $SXC $TKR $JELD $LDI $OIS $ENBL $BEN $WTRG $SBT $CHT $AKTS)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/F75otQF.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/z21eWxD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/aO8d0Fs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/mtCexr5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2HOk4x5.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/vcv5Pne.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GgX6FOh.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/PmzM56I.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/d5RZesR.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/fj3byrA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tTxuJf8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/OLOoH6Y.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-harley-davidson-spotify-trivago-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Harley-Davidson (HOG)** \u2013 The motorcycle maker\u2019s shares soared 9.4% in the premarket after the U.S. and the European Union ended a dispute involving steel and aluminum tariffs.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, November 4th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&amp;P 500\u2032s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.\n*****\n&gt; Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.\n*****\n&gt; Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%\n*****\n&gt; And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth,\u201d said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed\u2019s tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program \u201clater this month.\u201d This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus it\u2019s provided since the pandemic took hold.\n*****\n&gt; The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of today\u2019s meeting, which is why we aren\u2019t seeing a \u2018taper-tantrum 2.0,\u2019\u201d said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.\n*****\n&gt; \u2033[W]e\u2019re coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,\u201d said Oanda\u2019s Craig Erlam. \u201cThe economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week\u2019s number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.\n*****\n&gt; October\u2019s hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday. Consensus estimates call for 450,000 jobs added, according to Dow Jones. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, far short of the 500,000 estimate.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/csr94jX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xNBnRQj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fohWsiA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/dimSvYo.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/oImlOeJ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TnV9F9e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/f2OW6wj.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/2psSyZE.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5P5LNw4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RrVCnQY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/k3dndoN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/WhuthuY.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/XIdGKfq.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TOMORROW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5kgHYBl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TOMORROW MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jSIcjQk.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/VqyLZlv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/INro3Hf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/2GtTG34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5EXfeNk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/9QaOqLA.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rVxlcYW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aG5Jy73.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/u4uclmF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* DKNG\n* SKLZ\n* EVAX\n* ROKU\n* HIMX\n* CRO.X\n* PENN\n* MRNA\n* BTTX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-regeneron-planet-fitness-viacomcbs-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)** \u2013 The drug maker\u2019s shares rallied 2.7% in the premarket after it reported a significant beat on both the top and bottom lines for its latest quarter.
