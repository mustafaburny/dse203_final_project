        "selftext": "Having known very little about cybersecutiy but noticing increasingly frequent attacks earlier in the year, I initiated a position in Fortinet (I believe I actually found it on an SP500 stock screener) around $150 and needless to say I am happy with this investment.\n\nI was looking at the sector again today and would welcome any thoughts. It seems as though CrowdStrike (CRWD) has robust product offerings across the space and CloudFlare (NET) distinguishes itself by its focus on internet security although from investor decks they also project Zero Trust Network Infrastructure to be a larger portion of revenue in coming years. Zscaler (ZS) it seems focuses on more mid-sized business it seems and actually offers an integrated product with Zscaler +\u00a0CrowdStrike: [https://www.zscaler.com/partners/crowdstrike](https://www.zscaler.com/partners/crowdstrike)\n\nWithout understanding all the nuances, I was most struct by stock performances: NET is up 1100% in past two years while ZS is up over 600% compared to \"only\" 315% for my Fortinet (FTNT).\n\nI suppose my questions are:\n\n1. NET's revenue growth has been constant around 50% for several years. However, it is often described as a leader and it's stock has way outpaced others. What is the market pricing in? Is revenue growth expected to accelerate?\n\n2. ZS Rev growth seemed to slow but is back up around 60%. What happened? What is the biggest risk to these stocks more broadly?\n\n3. Broadly how to think of these stocks?\n\n4. Considering I plan to keep FTNT, would NET be the best addition to balance out?",

        "selftext": "Tech stocks seem to be falling off the rails of late, with the Nasdaq Composite COMP, 1.69% slumping Monday to take the benchmark index 7% below its record high. To closely followed tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, this is just a \u201cwhite knuckle moment\u201d that will soon pass. Ives says the worries around rising yields and growth stock valuations will give way to a year-end rally of at least 10% in the tech space. \n\n\u201cWhile the long standing bears will continue to yell fire into a crowded theater on a 20 bps move in the 10-year TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.521%, we instead focus on the $2 trillion digital transformation opportunity across the enterprise and consumer ecosystem over the coming years that is on tech\u2019s doorstep,\u201d he said in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cWhile the valuation debate will continue to be front and center in a rising rate environment, we fundamentally believe the Street is massively underestimating what the tech growth picture looks like into 2022 and thus remain a core tenet of our unwavering tech bull thesis with this another pound the table moment to own tech stocks.\u201d\n\nIves concedes that the pandemic led to \u201ca massive pull forward\u201d in demand for cloud, e-commerce, cyber security and other tech companies. But he said it\u2019s way too early to throw in the white towel and said investors should double down.\n\nApple AAPL, 2.07% is Wedbush\u2019s favorite of the FAANG stocks, as he cited Microsoft MSFT, 2.51%, DocuSign DOCU, 3.88%, Matterport MTTR, 1.75% and Pegasystems PEGA, 1.51% as favorite cloud stocks. In cybersecurity, Wedbush favorites are Varonis Systems VRNS, 1.75%, Zscaler ZS, 2.97%, Telos TLS, -0.44%, SailPoint Technologies SAIL, 3.41%, Tenable Holdings TENB, 3.06%, Palo Alto Networks PANW, 1.79% and Fortinet FTNT, 3.52%.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rate-fears-just-another-white-knuckle-moment-for-tech-stocks-says-this-analyst-whos-forecasting-rebound-of-at-least-10-11633427803?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rate-fears-just-another-white-knuckle-moment-for-tech-stocks-says-this-analyst-whos-forecasting-rebound-of-at-least-10-11633427803?mod=home-page)",

        "selftext": "There is a lot of debate in the investing world about the relevance of valuation metrics like the PS ratio, especially in the current climate where valuations across the board have become inflated relative to history. Some people go as far as to say that PS is irrelevant as long as the company is growing strongly. But I've started paying much closer attention to the PS ratio for the following reasons.\n\n1) I came across this article: [http://www.sionna.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dont-be-Fooled-by-the-PS-Insight-Piece.pdf](http://www.sionna.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dont-be-Fooled-by-the-PS-Insight-Piece.pdf). It's just over 2 pages including charts so I'm not going to bother with the tl/dr. It's worth a read.\n\n2) I conducted my own little analysis of stock performance during the 2010-2020 decade, which covers a large chunk of the longest bull market in history. I made a list of all the best performing stocks over that period, added a few notable IPOs from earlier in the decade, and then looked up their highest PS ratios. Here's the list in descending order of highest PS ratio:\n\nDXCM: 123.25 (which it hit on its IPO and then dropped sharply immediately after)  \nOLED: 58.35 (which it hit early, then dropped)  \nWDAY: 32.8 (hit early, then dropped)  \nMKTX: 31.45 (hit recently)  \nABMD: 29.98 (temporary spike, then dropped sharply)  \nTWLO: 27.82 (hit recently)  \nSPLK: 26.65 (hit early, then dropped)  \nNVDA: 25.65 (hit recently)  \nNOW: 25.53 (hit recently)  \nMA: 23.37 (hit recently)  \nREGN: 20.99 (hit on IPO, then dropped sharply)  \nFB: 18.40 (hit early and has been on a long decline since)  \nFTNT: 17.77 (hit recently)  \nEXR: 17.27 (hit recently)  \nZEN: 15.97 (hit recently)  \nNFLX: 12.67  \nFICO: 11.66  \nGOOG: 9.37  \nTTWO: 8.81  \nAVGO: 8.01  \nTDG: 7.89  \nAAPL: 7.80  \nTRU: 7.59  \nSTZ: 6.28  \nCTAS: 6.15  \nZNGA: 5.75  \nAMZN: 4.51  \nDPZ: 4.35  \n\n\n**Observations**\n\n1) From the entire list only 4 stocks hit a PS ratio over 30 at the highest. And almost all the stocks on this list are the best performing stocks of the past decade.\n\n2) In every single case of a PS ratio over 20, that level was only reached temporarily - either early in the decade, a brief spike somewhere along the line, or very recently. THERE ISN'T A SINGLE CASE IN THE SAMPLE OF A STOCK TRADING AT A PS RATIO OVER 20 FOR ANY SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME.\n\n3) The biggest and most successful tech stocks of the last 10 years (the FAANGs) don't even appear anywhere near the top. Facebook's had the highest PS ratio of 18.40, which it hit very early. AMZN's PS ratio has never even hit 5!  \n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe numbers don't lie. The simple truth is that stocks can't trade at high PS ratios for very long because their growth rates can't justify a high PS ratio over the long term. Eventually the stock will a correct, either through price (by selling off) or through time (by trading flat for a long period of time). What this means is that the upside potential for high PS stocks is very limited. The holy grail is to find companies trading at a low PS ratio while also exhibiting strong revenue growth and solid margins. If I find a stock I really like but is trading at a very high PS ratio, I will put it on my watch list and wait for the valuation to come down. The best opportunity is when the stock sells off on a disappointing earnings report. This does mean I might miss the occasional exception to the rule, but history shows those exceptions virtually don't exist.",

        "selftext": "As we approach what is defined as the fourth industrial revolution driven by the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) , a need for security of our data, computations, and privacy in technology is needed more than ever. In addition to the growing dependency of computers in every field we are shifting into quantum computing as well. Quantum computing has been seen as a revolutionary development with advantages and disadvantages. We are able to quickly compute algorithms like never before seen yet we are also faced with quicker and more efficient cyber attacks. \n\nAllied Market Share writes the cyber security market size was valued at $149.67 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $304.91 billion by 2027. Companies such as Fortinet ($FTNT), F5 Network ($FFIV), Splunk ($SPLK), and Cyberark ($CYBR) are leading the front with fortified cyber security. Apart from these are numerous other companies that are picking up pace and soon to become a prevalent competition. Today's focus is on two cybersecurity companies that have been making big moves and stirring up the sector: Hub Security and Caci International. \n\nHUB Security (TASE: HUB) specializes in confidential computing  for AI, financial services, healthcare, and critical infrastructure.  Established in 2017 by veterans of the IDF\u2019s elite intelligence units, HUB Security is fast emerging as a leader in  the field. The company's cybersecurity solutions are designed to protect a range of digital assets and industries from finTech to healthcare to critical civilian infrastructure.  Moreover, HUB employs a dual approach that leverages both hardware and software for military-grade cyber protection. The company has offices located in both Israel and the United States and has recently announced that it is weighing the option of  a listing on NASDAQ in the future. In terms of big deals, recently HUB merged with ALD (Advanced Logistics Developments) and acquired Comsec Global, vastly expanding their sales and consultancy architecture while positioning the company for a potential leap into the US tech market.\n\nCACI (NYSE: CACI) is an industry leader in cybersecurity, supporting the intelligence community and the entire US DoD with more than 1,800 cyber and information assur-ance professionals at all levels. They have been around for 20 years, performing targeted, country-wide, and global path network analyses for US government agencies, includ-ing providing cybersecurity tools, monitoring, and incident response automation for the Department of Homeland Security. Now that the US has been experiencing attacks more frequently and a new guideline in cybersecurity was released CACI would be taking on a bigger role for the US. \n\nCACI and HUB are just two of many cyber technology and defense companies that are revolutionizing today\u2019s digital landscape.  Both companies have seen some serious momentum of late, and I\u2019d say they are worthwhile plays to keep an eye on. In this age of technology most of our personal data and computing need security.  Companies like CACI and HUB are increasingly becoming indispensable to the private and public sectors alike, and the need for their services is only expected to increase over the course of this decade.  \\*\\*\\*Disclaimer: This is not investment advice, I have positions in both CACI and HUB, and trade responsibly",
