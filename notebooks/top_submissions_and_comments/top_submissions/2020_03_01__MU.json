        "selftext": "Just some ramblings from a 59 year old investor. Been through this in 87 and 2008 and it's the same every time. The world as we know it is ending, the rules for investing have changed, the paradigm has shifted, etc.... and we're all F'd. Yesterday the volume was huge and everything was getting kicked to the curb, in all categories, even gold and crypto. That's the definition of panic. Throwing out the babies with the bathwater. I was sitting on cash but putting it to work now. Started buying in at -15% and have been cost average buying every 5% pts down. I'm about 2/3's done. Bought heavily at the close yesterday and wanted to puke the whole time and my inner dialogue was telling me what a moron I am. Yesterday had all the symptoms of capitulation when we were down 27% peak to trough, but I think we'll end up down 30-35% all totaled before this is over, so there will be plenty of buy opportunities over the next few weeks. From there we may bounce around in a short lived bear market that traders will like. Not quite the existential financial crisis of 2008 but close. Loading up on MSFT, DIS, CSCO, AAPL, BAC, CVS, SBUX, MA, VZ, T, MU, STX, NKE etc... and plan to hold for 10+ year timeline. When this is over, interest rates will be at zero and people have to put their money somewhere for any kind of yield. If you got caught in this downdraft and you're at the point now where the pain is kicking your ass and you're tempted to sell... I gave in and did that in 2008 and when I reverse engineer if I had just done nothing and just shut my computer, I would have doubled my money in the following 5-7 years. Remember, nearly everyone you see commenting on CNBC and every article you read from the so called experts, all have a position to protect and every word they speak is in service of protecting that position/gameplan.",

        "selftext": "N95 masks DO HELP \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirator-use-faq.html\n\n\"What is an N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR)?\n\nAn N95 FFR is a type of respirator which removes particles from the air that are breathed through it. These respirators filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles. N95 FFRs are capable of filtering out all types of particles, including bacteria and viruses.\n\nWhat makes N95 respirators different from facemasks (sometimes called a surgical mask)?\n\nInfographic: Understanding the difference between surgical masks and N95 respiratorspdf icon\n\nN95 respirators reduce the wearer\u2019s exposure to airborne particles, from small particle aerosols to large droplets. N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles.\"\n\nHere's what's happening. \n\n1. Hospital staff need these masks A LOT MORE than you do. It means the government sshould have already placed the orders before the virus reaches their  countey. The problem right now is extreme demand, not that people are buying ineffective protective equipment. \n\n2. This virus usually enters via mouth, nose and eyes via droplets  from peoples mouth and nose while tallking, sneezing, coughing. To realise the maximum effectiveness that the N95 masks can achieve, you have to wear goggles also. Even glases will help a bit, unless of course a virus containing droplet reaches your eyes from the side. \n\n3.  Surgical masks effectiveness is indeed much lower, since they can only stop  large droplets but not smaller ones and they leave gaps from the side. \n\n4. For the above reasons, the US gov came to an agreement with manufactires to dramatically increase supply of those masks. The demand will only get higher, health services alone will need millions uppon millions according to the gov's statements about stocking up yesterday.\n\n5. APT makes their masks profit precicelly from N95 masks which also happen to be higher margin products for them (and I mean even without the price spikes). The announcements they made already about increased orders, concern the N95 masks specifically. \n\nhttp://www.alphaprotech.com/userfiles/doccenter/news/2020/Mask_Orders_Coronavirus.pdf   \n\nhttp://www.alphaprotech.com/userfiles/doccenter/news/2020/2020-02-27_Coronavirus_Update.pdf \n\nThis is to get things straight, you go short APT this week, you are in for a ride.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I\u2019m calling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What\u2019s the good news over the weekend? That they\u2019re going to pass this bill? That\u2019s already in the price.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dk1sp8x.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWQf6mH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wFeS0Wl.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaOFyrX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSJc4XK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Uu8KEZz.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NAgyg9J.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QWK8jnB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LJgR6Qi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3ihOUVn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LM2t3xD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0OcCxG9.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Bottom\n\n&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. \u201cNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 20th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoOzzG6Qk28))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.22.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=744D8neX74s))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

I\u2019m fully cognizant that this post may not age particularly well next week, or in the weeks hence, ([especially in light of recent news](https://nypost.com/2020/02/29/pope-francis-cancels-third-day-of-events-amid-mysterious-illness/)) but whatever; I have no shame putting myself out there. This is why God gave us anonymous Reddit handles.\n\n**One:** It\u2019s an election year.\u00a0 Trump absolutely won\u2019t let this market fail.\u00a0 By hook or crook, he will 100% do everything within his power (and not in his power) to prop up the market.\u00a0 (Including working Powell like a sock puppet.)\n\n**Two:** Investors will eventually realize/recollect what I still remember from two weeks ago:\u00a0 It\u2019s a classic chase for yield.\u00a0 As expensive as they\u2019d gotten, as recently as two weeks ago, [US equities still remained a bastion of growth compared to virtually *everywhere else* in the world](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/300-trillion-household-assets-bullish-us-stocks-morning-brief-110559102.html).\u00a0\u00a0 And that was *before* COVID-19.\u00a0 If the rest of the world was already teetering on the precipice of blazing-dumpster-firedom *before* the Coronavirus outbreak, now the full-on zombie apocalypse has actually arrived, where do you think all of those pension funds/hedge funds/etc are going to get their returns for 2020?

The market is forward-looking; after the initial panic settles, where will that chase for yield go?\n\nGame on.\u00a0 I\u2019m all in. Last week hedge funds suddenly woke up and remembered why they existed. But eventually, when the inevitable rebound happens, I expect Big Algo to launch it into the *stratosphere*. It shall be thunderous unlike any man has ever witnessed before. I obviously have no idea where the *exact* bottom is, but I\u2019ve learned that precisely timing it is a fool\u2019s errand.

I never got very high above 25k because I didn't have any semblance of the discipline to day trade or to trade that often.  I'd trade just for the sake of it and it would destroy me.\n\nI think my All Time chart is a pretty common one for those times... had my first big options win on MU, then lost it all on MU shortly after following Marty into the abyss, then became a permabear ZH reader for all of 2019 after the Dec 2018 drop.  The bottom was -86%.  When you've lost that much every missed opportunity torments you.  You just can't help but think about the time you liquidated 12k of AMD at $9 cost basis to gamble that money with options, or the time you sold your SBUX calls minutes before ER to responsibly take some risk off the table, only to miss out on a 30k gain the next day.  The constant dull shame of your portfolio is a daily thought.  You start wondering whether you have a gambling problem (you do).  You go to actual Vegas and can't really have fun at 5 dollar black jack table because you've lost 10 times that instantly on a shitty RH fill.\n\nYou have to turn this acquired risk appetite into a system that works for you rather than against you.   \nMy success started when I started doing debit spreads instead of just long calls/puts and when I learned to just chase whatever currently has existing momentum instead of trying to time breakdowns or breakouts.  And when I do want to do something retarded, make sure that it's both really cheap and will pay out at least 4 to 1 if it works.  \n\nPositions and big wins for the last spike:\n\n13k on AAPL calls on my wedding day (which is when the spike started)\n\n30k on TSLA puts on 2/5\n\n15k on TSLA calls on 2/19\n\n30k day trading puts on the week of destruction at end of Feb",

Here is your stock market news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Wednesday, March 25th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-25-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I\u2019m calling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What\u2019s the good news over the weekend? That they\u2019re going to pass this bill? That\u2019s already in the price.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dk1sp8x.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWQf6mH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wFeS0Wl.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaOFyrX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSJc4XK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Uu8KEZz.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NAgyg9J.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QWK8jnB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LJgR6Qi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3ihOUVn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LM2t3xD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0OcCxG9.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Bottom\n\n&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. \u201cNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

Many have the same expiry and  strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking   down their order to get filled faster.\n\nHere - [https://imgur.com/a/XqwvNVL](https://imgur.com/a/XqwvNVL)\n\nAlso  all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either buy  to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the    aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to  open.  Some of these may be  hedges and some most likely not.\n\nThe BILI orders are very aggressive, normally bili does not have so many sweeping  orders especially all puts.  I saw they had earnings so I guess people are putting money on them falling more.\n\nDon't  just enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases.  Use  technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined  instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if you worry  about losing what u put in and be  smart,  understand the  risks of  putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry. Learn IV AND IV CRUSH!!\n\nAlso  with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow all combined.\n\nEDIT  - Wanted to add, I make these posts a lot with different tickers, when I  am most confident I make a whole thread for one ticker. Like I did in  the past with MSFT/AAPL/TSLA/DIS, I am saying this because I have  different levels of confidence the orders will work out. These orders  today are aggressive but not super super aggressive. So the confidence  level is lower than something extremely aggressive and unusual like SBUX  order flow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT - FUCK Micron (MU).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT - We are in uncertain times so these orders have less of an impact.

        "selftext": "TLDR: Nvidia, Netflix, Dropbox, Facebook look like decent plays for a rebound. For the truly truly autistic - there is Micron.\n\nHere's my reasoning - the market has sold off a whole bunch in the past week, but some look much weaker than others right now. I wouldn't touch Apple with a 10 foot pole because it has gone up so far, and was the favorite for so long. But if there is a rebound, which stocks might be the strongest? Not the ones everyone has been FOMOing into for the past 2 months because those people have just got burned (I'm looking at you MSFT $200 call holders). \n\nAnd definitely not $SPCE - probably one of the worst ideas ever to come across this sub. \n\nIf I look at which ones have held up very strong the past week and close on Friday, Nvidia definitely gets my attention. It's been a slower climber but recently broke out and last week just retested its upward trend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NVDA still on an linear uptrend, up 7&amp;#37; on Friday 2\\/28](https://preview.redd.it/a9vdb1w6l5k41.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0f7eb6f3ac9f0cf270f390dac9608d48d6ebbfe)\n\nMedia companies with no physical presence (hence coronavirus safe) also seem like decent bets. I'm talking about Netflix and Facebook here. $FB and $NFLX are the only FAANG stocks not breaking out to new highs recently and there could be a rotation of money into them as they are minimally affected by coronavirus. Also Facebook has announced a $10 billion stock buyback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NFLX mostly flat last week, still in solid uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/fhafupxfl5k41.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72057d5a941678e3deda16910e4418f4e988180f)\n\nDon't have a position because last week was insane, but watching.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I\u2019m calling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What\u2019s the good news over the weekend? That they\u2019re going to pass this bill? That\u2019s already in the price.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dk1sp8x.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWQf6mH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wFeS0Wl.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaOFyrX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSJc4XK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Uu8KEZz.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NAgyg9J.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QWK8jnB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LJgR6Qi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3ihOUVn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LM2t3xD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0OcCxG9.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Bottom\n\n&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. \u201cNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 23rd, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-23-2020.html)\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures turned strongly positive Monday morning after the Federal Reserve pledged asset purchases with no limit to support markets. Dow futures hit their 5% \u201climit down\u201d overnight, and were off 600-points at one stage Monday morning, as a massive coronavirus funding package failed a key Senate procedural vote Sunday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked another 900 points or 4.5% on Friday, bringing the weekly decline to over 17% for the worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Ahead of Monday\u2019s session, the Dow was off more than 35% from last month\u2019s record highs. The New York Stock Exchange\u2019s trading floor will be close starting Monday. The NYSE will go to fully electronic trading. The 10-year Treasury yield, which popped back above 1% last week, was below that level early Monday.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top-level White House and congressional negotiators burned the midnight oil over the now-nearly $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package. Democrats blocked the bill in Sunday\u2019s vote, saying it did too much to bail out companies and not enough to help workers. Several GOP senators, including Rand Paul, who tested positive for the coronavirus, were not present to vote. Others, such as Mitt Romney, were in quarantine as a precaution. The Federal Reserve and Treasury are working on financing programs that could be worth $4 trillion. Goldman Sachs upgraded shares of Boeing, which is hoping for a bailout. Boeing stock has dropped 80% from recent highs on the dual crises of the outbreak and the grounding of its 737 Max.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * The United States has the third most coronavirus cases in the world, with over 35,000 and 471 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than half the U.S. cases are in New York, where the death toll increased to 153. Washington state has the second-most cases, with nearly 2,000 confirmed and 95 deaths. New Jersey, California and Illinois round out the top five states. President Donald Trump on Sunday activated the National Guard in New York, Washington state and California in order to combat the spread of the coronavirus. New York plans to run a clinical trial, beginning Tuesday, of a treatment regimen of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin, a drug cocktail that has shown promise in fighting the coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases topped 343,000, with 14,789 deaths and over 98,800 recoveries. China, where the outbreak started in December, still has the most cases at over 81,400. China\u2019s 3,274 deaths are second to Italy\u2019s 5,476 deaths. Italy is second in total cases at over 59,100. The U.S., Spain and Germany round out the top five countries. German Chancellor Angela Merkel went into quarantine over the weekend after contact with a doctor who tested positive for the virus. The German government is set to unveil major stimulus measures. Pressure mounts to cancel the Tokyo summer Olympics, set to begin at the end of July. Canada said it won\u2019t send teams to compete. Local media reports indicate that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering a delay.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Cisco Systems is committing $225 million to assist in efforts aimed at combating the coronavirus while the rest of Silicon Valley also initiates an investment blitz. 3M said it will supply New York and Seattle with a half-million N95 respirator masks to address the ongoing shortage of health-care equipment. Merck said it will supply New York City with a half-million masks.

Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ...

As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

Here is your stock market news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Wednesday, March 25th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-25-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.

The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday\u2019s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats\u2019 $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at months,\u201d the president said.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said. The carriers and the White House have made no final decisions.Demand for air travel has plummeted as many states have issued formal stay-at-home orders or just encouraged people not to leave their homes. Social-distancing has become the new way of life as the world grapples with containing the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cfaAWsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kH00D11.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/SjUA7ht.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($INFO $LX $AEYE $NEOG $TNP $CMCM $VTSI $YJ $QIWI $ECOR $EH $DMAC $PANL $FENG $CANG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XJRjXat.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/OOVZiVo.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/joftHtT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/irtsavz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/AIITRE6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/RlkMxl6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/trFFJU3.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/MxOAol4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BgKOWeP.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* NVAX\n* ZM\n* NFLX\n* PENN\n* NUGT\n* MAIN\n* IVR\n* SCPH\n* NKE\n* BDTX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-chevron-twitter-amazon-mondelez-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Chevron (CVX)** \u2013 Chevron plans to cut capital spending plans for 2020 by 20%, and will suspend its share buyback program.

Here is your stock market news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, March 24th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-24-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures hit their 5% \u201climit up\u201d levels Tuesday as top Senate and White House officials neared a $2 trillion deal to rescue the economy from the coronavirus crisis. The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday\u2019s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats\u2019 $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at months,\u201d the president said.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said. The carriers and the White House have made no final decisions.Demand for air travel has plummeted as many states have issued formal stay-at-home orders or just encouraged people not to leave their homes. Social-distancing has become the new way of life as the world grapples with containing the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cfaAWsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kH00D11.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/SjUA7ht.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($INFO $LX $AEYE $NEOG $TNP $CMCM $VTSI $YJ $QIWI $ECOR $EH $DMAC $PANL $FENG $CANG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XJRjXat.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/OOVZiVo.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/joftHtT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/irtsavz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/AIITRE6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/RlkMxl6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/trFFJU3.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/MxOAol4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BgKOWeP.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* NVAX\n* ZM\n* NFLX\n* PENN\n* NUGT\n* MAIN\n* IVR\n* SCPH\n* NKE\n* BDTX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-chevron-twitter-amazon-mondelez-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Chevron (CVX)** \u2013 Chevron plans to cut capital spending plans for 2020 by 20%, and will suspend its share buyback program.

I\u2019m fully cognizant that this post may not age particularly well next week, or in the weeks hence, ([especially in light of recent news](https://nypost.com/2020/02/29/pope-francis-cancels-third-day-of-events-amid-mysterious-illness/)) but whatever; I have no shame putting myself out there. This is why God gave us anonymous Reddit handles.\n\n**One:** It\u2019s an election year.\u00a0 Trump absolutely won\u2019t let this market fail.\u00a0 By hook or crook, he will 100% do everything within his power (and not in his power) to prop up the market.\u00a0 (Including working Powell like a sock puppet.)\n\n**Two:** Investors will eventually realize/recollect what I still remember from two weeks ago:\u00a0 It\u2019s a classic chase for yield.\u00a0 As expensive as they\u2019d gotten, as recently as two weeks ago, [US equities still remained a bastion of growth compared to virtually *everywhere else* in the world](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/300-trillion-household-assets-bullish-us-stocks-morning-brief-110559102.html).\u00a0\u00a0 And that was *before* COVID-19.\u00a0 If the rest of the world was already teetering on the precipice of blazing-dumpster-firedom *before* the Coronavirus outbreak, now the full-on zombie apocalypse has actually arrived, where do you think all of those pension funds/hedge funds/etc are going to get their returns for 2020? (They need to be able to somehow justify charging those fat fees!)\u00a0 [Italy?](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/02/18/807025154/ciao-italia-why-italys-youth-are-leaving-in-droves) [The UK?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit) [Germany?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/world/europe/germany-hanau-shisha-bar-shooting.html)\u00a0 China?\u00a0 America has now literally become the only game in town. The market is forward-looking; after the initial panic settles, where will that chase for yield go?\n\nGame on.\u00a0 I\u2019m all in. Last week hedge funds suddenly woke up and remembered why they existed. But eventually, when the inevitable rebound happens, I expect Big Algo to launch it into the *stratosphere*. It shall be thunderous unlike any man has ever witnessed before. I obviously have no idea where the *exact* bottom is, but I\u2019ve learned that precisely timing it is a fool\u2019s errand. (If you\u2019re able to do it, then good on you. I am happy for you; I am simply not as skilled as you are.) The only way (for me at least) is to ride it out. Assuming you\u2019re not facing a margin call, etc, my humble suggestion is to just take a vacation and not even look at what\u2019s going on. Check back in a week or month or two.\n\n(Disclaimer: I\u2019m personally currently long AMD and MU\u2013 I believe in the Big Data Story! PS.

Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.

        "selftext": "Just some ramblings from a 59 year old investor. Been through this in 87 and 2008 and it's the same every time. The world as we know it is ending, the rules for investing have changed, the paradigm has shifted, etc.... and we're all F'd. Yesterday the volume was huge and everything was getting kicked to the curb, in all categories, even gold and crypto. That's the definition of panic. Throwing out the babies with the bathwater. I was sitting on cash but putting it to work now. Started buying in at -15% and have been cost average buying every 5% pts down. I'm about 2/3's done. Bought heavily at the close yesterday and wanted to puke the whole time and my inner dialogue was telling me what a moron I am. Yesterday had all the symptoms of capitulation when we were down 27% peak to trough, but I think we'll end up down 30-35% all totaled before this is over, so there will be plenty of buy opportunities over the next few weeks. From there we may bounce around in a short lived bear market that traders will like. Not quite the existential financial crisis of 2008 but close. Loading up on MSFT, DIS, CSCO, AAPL, BAC, CVS, SBUX, MA, VZ, T, MU, STX, NKE etc... and plan to hold for 10+ year timeline. When this is over, interest rates will be at zero and people have to put their money somewhere for any kind of yield. If you got caught in this downdraft and you're at the point now where the pain is kicking your ass and you're tempted to sell... I gave in and did that in 2008 and when I reverse engineer if I had just done nothing and just shut my computer, I would have doubled my money in the following 5-7 years. Remember, nearly everyone you see commenting on CNBC and every article you read from the so called experts, all have a position to protect and every word they speak is in service of protecting that position/gameplan.",

These respirators filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles. N95 FFRs are capable of filtering out all types of particles, including bacteria and viruses.\n\nWhat makes N95 respirators different from facemasks (sometimes called a surgical mask)?\n\nInfographic: Understanding the difference between surgical masks and N95 respiratorspdf icon\n\nN95 respirators reduce the wearer\u2019s exposure to airborne particles, from small particle aerosols to large droplets. N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles.\"\n\nHere's what's happening. \n\n1. Hospital staff need these masks A LOT MORE than you do. It means the government sshould have already placed the orders before the virus reaches their  countey. The problem right now is extreme demand, not that people are buying ineffective protective equipment. \n\n2. This virus usually enters via mouth, nose and eyes via droplets  from peoples mouth and nose while tallking, sneezing, coughing. To realise the maximum effectiveness that the N95 masks can achieve, you have to wear goggles also. Even glases will help a bit, unless of course a virus containing droplet reaches your eyes from the side. \n\n3.  Surgical masks effectiveness is indeed much lower, since they can only stop  large droplets but not smaller ones and they leave gaps from the side. \n\n4. For the above reasons, the US gov came to an agreement with manufactires to dramatically increase supply of those masks. The demand will only get higher, health services alone will need millions uppon millions according to the gov's statements about stocking up yesterday.\n\n5. APT makes their masks profit precicelly from N95 masks which also happen to be higher margin products for them (and I mean even without the price spikes). The announcements they made already about increased orders, concern the N95 masks specifically. \n\nhttp://www.alphaprotech.com/userfiles/doccenter/news/2020/Mask_Orders_Coronavirus.pdf   \n\nhttp://www.alphaprotech.com/userfiles/doccenter/news/2020/2020-02-27_Coronavirus_Update.pdf \n\nThis is to get things straight, you go short APT this week, you are in for a ride.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I\u2019m calling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What\u2019s the good news over the weekend? That they\u2019re going to pass this bill? That\u2019s already in the price.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dk1sp8x.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWQf6mH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wFeS0Wl.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaOFyrX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSJc4XK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Uu8KEZz.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NAgyg9J.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QWK8jnB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LJgR6Qi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3ihOUVn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LM2t3xD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0OcCxG9.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Bottom\n\n&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. \u201cNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 20th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoOzzG6Qk28))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.22.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=744D8neX74s))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

        "selftext": "Longtime lurker, first-time poster to this sub. I\u2019m fully cognizant that this post may not age particularly well next week, or in the weeks hence, ([especially in light of recent news](https://nypost.com/2020/02/29/pope-francis-cancels-third-day-of-events-amid-mysterious-illness/)) but whatever; I have no shame putting myself out there. This is why God gave us anonymous Reddit handles.\n\n**One:** It\u2019s an election year.\u00a0 Trump absolutely won\u2019t let this market fail.\u00a0 By hook or crook, he will 100% do everything within his power (and not in his power) to prop up the market.\u00a0 (Including working Powell like a sock puppet.)\n\n**Two:** Investors will eventually realize/recollect what I still remember from two weeks ago:\u00a0 It\u2019s a classic chase for yield.\u00a0 As expensive as they\u2019d gotten, as recently as two weeks ago, [US equities still remained a bastion of growth compared to virtually *everywhere else* in the world](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/300-trillion-household-assets-bullish-us-stocks-morning-brief-110559102.html).\u00a0\u00a0 And that was *before* COVID-19.\u00a0 If the rest of the world was already teetering on the precipice of blazing-dumpster-firedom *before* the Coronavirus outbreak, now the full-on zombie apocalypse has actually arrived, where do you think all of those pension funds/hedge funds/etc are going to get their returns for 2020? (They need to be able to somehow justify charging those fat fees!)\u00a0 [Italy?](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/02/18/807025154/ciao-italia-why-italys-youth-are-leaving-in-droves) [The UK?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit) [Germany?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/world/europe/germany-hanau-shisha-bar-shooting.html)\u00a0 China?\u00a0 America has now literally become the only game in town. The market is forward-looking; after the initial panic settles, where will that chase for yield go?\n\nGame on.\u00a0 I\u2019m all in. Last week hedge funds suddenly woke up and remembered why they existed. But eventually, when the inevitable rebound happens, I expect Big Algo to launch it into the *stratosphere*. It shall be thunderous unlike any man has ever witnessed before. I obviously have no idea where the *exact* bottom is, but I\u2019ve learned that precisely timing it is a fool\u2019s errand. (If you\u2019re able to do it, then good on you. I am happy for you; I am simply not as skilled as you are.) The only way (for me at least) is to ride it out. Assuming you\u2019re not facing a margin call, etc, my humble suggestion is to just take a vacation and not even look at what\u2019s going on. Check back in a week or month or two.\n\n(Disclaimer: I\u2019m personally currently long AMD and MU\u2013 I believe in the Big Data Story! PS. [AMD's Investor Day is March 5!](https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-host-financial-analyst-day-march-5-2020) Am expecting great things!)\n\nPPS. All that said, I\u2019m fully aware there are tons of people thinking the worst is yet to come. [This clip from WSB is one of the funniest things I\u2019ve seen in a long time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbjmhr/a_preview_of_next_week/)\n\nPPPS.

I never got very high above 25k because I didn't have any semblance of the discipline to day trade or to trade that often.  I'd trade just for the sake of it and it would destroy me.\n\nI think my All Time chart is a pretty common one for those times... had my first big options win on MU, then lost it all on MU shortly after following Marty into the abyss, then became a permabear ZH reader for all of 2019 after the Dec 2018 drop.  The bottom was -86%.  When you've lost that much every missed opportunity torments you.  You just can't help but think about the time you liquidated 12k of AMD at $9 cost basis to gamble that money with options, or the time you sold your SBUX calls minutes before ER to responsibly take some risk off the table, only to miss out on a 30k gain the next day.  The constant dull shame of your portfolio is a daily thought.  You start wondering whether you have a gambling problem (you do).  You go to actual Vegas and can't really have fun at 5 dollar black jack table because you've lost 10 times that instantly on a shitty RH fill.\n\nYou have to turn this acquired risk appetite into a system that works for you rather than against you.   \nMy success started when I started doing debit spreads instead of just long calls/puts and when I learned to just chase whatever currently has existing momentum instead of trying to time breakdowns or breakouts.  And when I do want to do something retarded, make sure that it's both really cheap and will pay out at least 4 to 1 if it works.  \n\nPositions and big wins for the last spike:\n\n13k on AAPL calls on my wedding day (which is when the spike started)\n\n30k on TSLA puts on 2/5\n\n15k on TSLA calls on 2/19\n\n30k day trading puts on the week of destruction at end of Feb",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday. Here is your stock market news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Wednesday, March 25th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-25-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I\u2019m calling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What\u2019s the good news over the weekend? That they\u2019re going to pass this bill? That\u2019s already in the price.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dk1sp8x.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWQf6mH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wFeS0Wl.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaOFyrX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSJc4XK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Uu8KEZz.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NAgyg9J.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QWK8jnB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LJgR6Qi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3ihOUVn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LM2t3xD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0OcCxG9.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Bottom\n\n&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. \u201cNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

        "selftext": "Today I included the aggressive orders, DIS seems really aggressive, but the IV is so high now I think it may be too late to jump into it.\n\nThese options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and  strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking   down their order to get filled faster.\n\nHere - [https://imgur.com/a/XqwvNVL](https://imgur.com/a/XqwvNVL)\n\nAlso  all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either buy  to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the    aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to  open.  Some of these may be  hedges and some most likely not.\n\nThe BILI orders are very aggressive, normally bili does not have so many sweeping  orders especially all puts.  I saw they had earnings so I guess people are putting money on them falling more.\n\nDon't  just enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases.  Use  technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined  instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if you worry  about losing what u put in and be  smart,  understand the  risks of  putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry. Learn IV AND IV CRUSH!!\n\nAlso  with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow all combined.\n\nEDIT  - Wanted to add, I make these posts a lot with different tickers, when I  am most confident I make a whole thread for one ticker. Like I did in  the past with MSFT/AAPL/TSLA/DIS, I am saying this because I have  different levels of confidence the orders will work out. These orders  today are aggressive but not super super aggressive. So the confidence  level is lower than something extremely aggressive and unusual like SBUX  order flow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT - FUCK Micron (MU).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT - We are in uncertain times so these orders have less of an impact.

        "selftext": "TLDR: Nvidia, Netflix, Dropbox, Facebook look like decent plays for a rebound. For the truly truly autistic - there is Micron.\n\nHere's my reasoning - the market has sold off a whole bunch in the past week, but some look much weaker than others right now. I wouldn't touch Apple with a 10 foot pole because it has gone up so far, and was the favorite for so long. But if there is a rebound, which stocks might be the strongest? Not the ones everyone has been FOMOing into for the past 2 months because those people have just got burned (I'm looking at you MSFT $200 call holders). \n\nAnd definitely not $SPCE - probably one of the worst ideas ever to come across this sub. \n\nIf I look at which ones have held up very strong the past week and close on Friday, Nvidia definitely gets my attention. It's been a slower climber but recently broke out and last week just retested its upward trend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NVDA still on an linear uptrend, up 7&amp;#37; on Friday 2\\/28](https://preview.redd.it/a9vdb1w6l5k41.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0f7eb6f3ac9f0cf270f390dac9608d48d6ebbfe)\n\nMedia companies with no physical presence (hence coronavirus safe) also seem like decent bets. I'm talking about Netflix and Facebook here. $FB and $NFLX are the only FAANG stocks not breaking out to new highs recently and there could be a rotation of money into them as they are minimally affected by coronavirus. Also Facebook has announced a $10 billion stock buyback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NFLX mostly flat last week, still in solid uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/fhafupxfl5k41.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72057d5a941678e3deda16910e4418f4e988180f)\n\nDon't have a position because last week was insane, but watching.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ...

As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. \u201d$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Sharp recession\n&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we\u2019re going to get a clearer picture,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he\u2019s watching the PMI data. \u201cThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it\u2019s sell first, ask questions later.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI expect that we\u2019ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,\u201d said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; # More Fed Artillery\n&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar\u2019s run on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; As the world\u2019s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there\u2019s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we\u2019re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,\u201d said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. \u201cI\u2019m watching what\u2019s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Liquidity infinity\u2019\n&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed\u2019s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. \u201cThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I\u2019m calling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What\u2019s the good news over the weekend? That they\u2019re going to pass this bill? That\u2019s already in the price.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dk1sp8x.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wWQf6mH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/wFeS0Wl.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BaOFyrX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wSJc4XK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Uu8KEZz.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NAgyg9J.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QWK8jnB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LJgR6Qi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3ihOUVn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LM2t3xD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/0OcCxG9.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Bottom\n\n&gt; With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&amp;P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. \u201cNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&amp;P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&amp;P 500 Index didn\u2019t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&amp;P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn\u2019t yet reflect it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive\u2014the S&amp;P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n&gt; We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook\u2014visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases\u2014remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession\u2014almost surely coming soon\u2014and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week\u2014the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n&gt; The last box\u2014markets pricing in recession\u2014was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n&gt; Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,\u201d noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.\u201d\n\n&gt; The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know it\u2019s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n&gt; The market volatility continues, as the S&amp;P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we\u2019ll take another angle on this.\n\n&gt; We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn\u2019t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n&gt; The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n&gt; What happens next? \u201cClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&amp;P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We\u2019d like to stress, we don\u2019t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n&gt; Even though equities rose today, the S&amp;P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&amp;P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n&gt; Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n&gt; While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n&gt; While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n&gt; In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&amp;P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n&gt; This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$PAYS** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$ONTX** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$INFO** \n&gt; * **$GO** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$LX** \n&gt; * **$SCVL** \n&gt; * **$SNX** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$AEYE** \n&gt; * **$KBH** \n&gt; * **$RKDA** \n&gt; * **$FDS** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$PRGS** \n&gt; * **$OPGN** \n&gt; * **$SCS** \n&gt; * **$NEOG** \n&gt; * **$PUMP** \n&gt; * **$HYRE** \n&gt; * **$AIR** \n&gt; * **$MYOS** \n&gt; * **$LIQT** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$VTSI** \n&gt; * **$OCGN** \n&gt; * **$QIWI** \n&gt; * **$WOR** \n&gt; * **$TNP** \n&gt; * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n&gt; **Micron Technology, Inc.

Here is your stock market news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Wednesday, March 25th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-25-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ...

The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday\u2019s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats\u2019 $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at months,\u201d the president said.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said. The carriers and the White House have made no final decisions.Demand for air travel has plummeted as many states have issued formal stay-at-home orders or just encouraged people not to leave their homes.

The exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow, which has no curbs, was up just over 5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 582 points or 3.1% on Monday after the Senate failed for a second time in less than 24 hours to advance the stimulus bill. Investors were more concerned about talks on Capitol Hill than encouraged by the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement Monday of an open-ended asset purchase program. As of Monday\u2019s close, the lowest since November 2016, the Dow was down 37% from its record highs last month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Senate Democrats expressed optimism about reaching a relief deal from the coronavirus crisis after negotiations with Trump administration officials stretched late into the night. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks were set to resume Tuesday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out with House Democrats\u2019 $2.5 trillion bill. Also on Monday, President Donald Trump suggested he wants to urge businesses to reopen, sooner rather than later. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at months,\u201d the president said.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * As Trump considers relaxing some coronavirus restrictions, the U.K. issued a stay-at-home order, starting Tuesday, allowing only essential trips. All nonessential public buildings and places are closed, ranging from libraries to churches, outdoor gyms and playgrounds. All social events including weddings and baptisms are also prohibited. In China, the two-month lockdown of most of Hubei province was lifted. However, Wuhan, the city in the province where the coronavirus originated in December, remains locked down until April 8.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases approached 384,000 with 16,594 deaths and nearly 102,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, at about 81,500 cases, has just 21% of the infections around the world as the spread in European nations and the United States continued to spike higher. Italy, the hardest-hit country outside China, saw cases rise to nearly 64,000. The death toll in Italy of 6,077 was nearly double that of China and the highest in the world. Cases in America increased to 46,450 with 593 deaths. Nearly half the U.S. cases and the highest U.S. death toll of 188 were in New York state.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Top U.S. airlines are working on plans for a possible voluntary shutdown of nearly all U.S. passenger flights, industry and federal officials told The Wall Street Journal. The government was also talking about ordering such a move, the Journal said. The carriers and the White House have made no final decisions.Demand for air travel has plummeted as many states have issued formal stay-at-home orders or just encouraged people not to leave their homes. Social-distancing has become the new way of life as the world grapples with containing the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cfaAWsy.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kH00D11.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/SjUA7ht.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($INFO $LX $AEYE $NEOG $TNP $CMCM $VTSI $YJ $QIWI $ECOR $EH $DMAC $PANL $FENG $CANG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XJRjXat.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/OOVZiVo.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/joftHtT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/irtsavz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/AIITRE6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/RlkMxl6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/trFFJU3.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/MxOAol4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BgKOWeP.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* NVAX\n* ZM\n* NFLX\n* PENN\n* NUGT\n* MAIN\n* IVR\n* SCPH\n* NKE\n* BDTX\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-chevron-twitter-amazon-mondelez-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Chevron (CVX)** \u2013 Chevron plans to cut capital spending plans for 2020 by 20%, and will suspend its share buyback program.

I\u2019m fully cognizant that this post may not age particularly well next week, or in the weeks hence, ([especially in light of recent news](https://nypost.com/2020/02/29/pope-francis-cancels-third-day-of-events-amid-mysterious-illness/)) but whatever; I have no shame putting myself out there. This is why God gave us anonymous Reddit handles.\n\n**One:** It\u2019s an election year.\u00a0 Trump absolutely won\u2019t let this market fail.\u00a0 By hook or crook, he will 100% do everything within his power (and not in his power) to prop up the market.\u00a0 (Including working Powell like a sock puppet.)\n\n**Two:** Investors will eventually realize/recollect what I still remember from two weeks ago:\u00a0 It\u2019s a classic chase for yield.\u00a0 As expensive as they\u2019d gotten, as recently as two weeks ago, [US equities still remained a bastion of growth compared to virtually *everywhere else* in the world](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/300-trillion-household-assets-bullish-us-stocks-morning-brief-110559102.html).\u00a0\u00a0 And that was *before* COVID-19.\u00a0 If the rest of the world was already teetering on the precipice of blazing-dumpster-firedom *before* the Coronavirus outbreak, now the full-on zombie apocalypse has actually arrived, where do you think all of those pension funds/hedge funds/etc are going to get their returns for 2020? (They need to be able to somehow justify charging those fat fees!)\u00a0 [Italy?](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/02/18/807025154/ciao-italia-why-italys-youth-are-leaving-in-droves) [The UK?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit) [Germany?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/world/europe/germany-hanau-shisha-bar-shooting.html)\u00a0 China?\u00a0 America has now literally become the only game in town. The market is forward-looking; after the initial panic settles, where will that chase for yield go?\n\nGame on.\u00a0 I\u2019m all in. Last week hedge funds suddenly woke up and remembered why they existed. But eventually, when the inevitable rebound happens, I expect Big Algo to launch it into the *stratosphere*. It shall be thunderous unlike any man has ever witnessed before. I obviously have no idea where the *exact* bottom is, but I\u2019ve learned that precisely timing it is a fool\u2019s errand. (If you\u2019re able to do it, then good on you. I am happy for you; I am simply not as skilled as you are.) The only way (for me at least) is to ride it out. Assuming you\u2019re not facing a margin call, etc, my humble suggestion is to just take a vacation and not even look at what\u2019s going on. Check back in a week or month or two.\n\n(Disclaimer: I\u2019m personally currently long AMD and MU\u2013 I believe in the Big Data Story! PS.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday. Here is your stock market news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Wednesday, March 25th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-25-2020.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Dow futures saw wild swings Wednesday between strong gains and modest losses. Investors overnight had been encouraged by the White House and Senate reaching a deal on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its best session since 1933, soaring over 2,112 points or nearly 11.4% in anticipation of the relief bill. Despite Tuesday\u2019s gains, the Dow remained about 30% below last month\u2019s record highs.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Boeing shares jumped over 11% in the premarket after Reuters reported that plane-maker plans to restart production on its grounded 737 Max fleet by May. The Senate bill, the final details of which have not been released, has money set aside to \u201cstabilize key national industries,\u201d according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * McConnell, just after 1:30 a.m. ET, announced the stimulus bill agreement, and said senators will vote and pass it later Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican promised the bill would help struggling industries and rush financial assistance to Americans through direct checks to households, enhanced unemployment insurance, hundreds of billions of loans in emergency loans to small businesses, and more resources for hospitals and medical equipment. Anything passed by the GOP-controlled Senate must be reconciled with the Democratic-controlled House, which drafted its own plan.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Despite medical community warnings about the continuing threat of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he wants to open the economy back up by Easter Sunday, which is less than three weeks away on April 12. Trump said he offered the holiday as a deadline because Easter is \u201cvery special\u201d to him. The president added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the day ... [but] that would be a beautiful thing.\u201d He stressed that any the decision to reopen the economy will be \u201cbased on hard facts and data\u201d and will be \u201cgrounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * U.S. coronavirus cases have soared in recent days, as testing kits have become more available. According to Johns Hopkins University, America has more than 55,200 cases, the third most of any country in the world, with 802 deaths. Italy\u2019s more than 69,100 cases are second only China\u2019s over 81,600 cases. However, Italy\u2019s death toll of 6,820 is more than double that of China, where the outbreak started in December. Global cases increased to about 428,400 with 19,119 deaths and over 109,400 recoveries. Spain, Germany and France are also emerging as hot-spots in Europe. In Britain, Prince Charles\u2019 household announced that the heir to the throne has tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Target, one of the retailers that\u2019s seen a surge in shoppers, said Wednesday it\u2019s scaling back plans to remodel hundreds of stores, postponing openings of new stores and delaying the addition of fresh groceries and beer to curbside pickup. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer will focus on a singular mission: providing food, medicine and other essential items during the pandemic. Target is also withdrawing its guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year because of the unpredictable business climate. People have been flocking to Target, Walmart, Costco and Amazon, stocking up in case of prolonged supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/fSZQmSW.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/riM2wSU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Lbg1Yjq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8KStTCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/aUBjBP0.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $LULU $NKE $PAYS $SIG $PAYX $GME $ONTX $CSIQ $JT $INFO $GO $WGO $LX $SCVL $SNX $HOME $BWAY $AEYE $KBH $RKDA $FDS $ERJ $PRGS $OPGN $SCS $NEOG $PUMP $HYRE $AIR $MYOS $LIQT $SAIC $SCWX $ESLT $VTSI $OCGN $QIWI $WOR $TNP $HTHT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($PAYX $WGO $MYOS $CYRN $ESLT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wsKnBCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ksMrAMO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/loxsY7U.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bn1Leu6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/itDRVWv.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/VE62GJ4.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/j02oFK1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/1VSsvSc.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hYpoP09.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* BA\n* AAL\n* RCL\n* SPY\n* DAL\n* JNUG\n* NCLH\n* DIS\n* UAL\n* ZM\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-target-nike-facebook-apple-peloton-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Target (TGT)** \u2013 The retailer joined the ranks of those withdrawing financial guidance, due to the uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.
