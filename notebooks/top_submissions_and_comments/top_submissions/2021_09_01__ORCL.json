        "selftext": "**The Broader Markets**\n\nLast Week \u2013 SPY was down about 1.7% last week, more than the 0.8% expected move options were pricing.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing a 1.5% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $445 that corresponds to about **$438** as a *bearish expected move* and **$452** as a *bullish expected move*.\n\n**Implied Volatility** \u2013 The VIX was higher on the week and ended Friday at about 21, up from 16.50 to start last week. It is now higher than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 23, higher than last week.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week**\n\nThe major ETFs are all pricing larger moves for this week than they did last week:\n\n* SPY **1.5%**\n* QQQ **1.6%**\n* IWM **2.3%**\n* DIA **1.5%**\n\nThe 1.5% expected move in the SPY is higher than the historical average. An Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday), needs the ETF to finish between $438 and $452 to see Max Gain. Here\u2019s an example on the Options AI chart, showing the risk/reward, breakevens and probability of profit of a $1 wide condor at the Expected Move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cg0ks2ez44n71.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ccbb06cee17f40f627c650fed02dde02607ed4b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In the News**\n\nExpected moves for the week in Bitcoin and Ethereum, based on crypto options:\n\n* BTC 6%\n* ETH 8%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings**\n\nIt\u2019s a light week for earnings report with Oracle the largest company of note reporting:\n\nMonday\n\n**Oracle** ORCL / [Expected Move: **5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ORCL) / Recent moves: -6%, -7%, +2%\n\nTuesday\n\n**Fuelcell**\u00a0FCEL / [Expected Move: **13%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FCEL) / Recent moves: -11%, -10%, +3%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarnings won't be a major focus for the market until October so macro trends take precedence in September. Overall volatility was quite low to end the Summer and was awakened last week by the string of down days in the market. IV has spiked (a little) and is now pricing in market moves similar to the move we saw last week. It is now barely above its historical average.",

        "selftext": "Since there has been quite a bit of interest and criticism from the [original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/pmhcif/my_favorite_loweffort_lowriskish_spy_options/), I thought I'd create another post to clear some things up and address concerns + show how I've applied it.\n\n**Applied Strategy**\n\nFirst, there were several questions on how I've applied it specifically, and even more about how the past few days/week has affected my plays. Short answer: it hadn't. Longer answer: real-life application is going to differ from a backtest unless you're an algo with sufficient AUM and leverage to let the strat take advantage of the statistical edge (58% in our case). Your own circumstances are going to dictate how you trade, and likely aren't 1:1 with mine, but for clarity my current trading plans are affected by:\n\n* I'm leaving my job in less than two months. I'll have a period of planned unemployment, but my primary financial concern is capital preservation; thus, I'm much more conservative and risk adverse currently.\n* I still do have to work (CST) and am generally in the office between 8-830AM when the market opens. I can generally squeeze some time to myself at open, but with the intraday volatility we've been seeing in SPY, coupled with my risk aversion, I've trended towards closing at open if the open price exceeds closing.\n\nSince P/L is so interesting to everyone (although it shouldn't be due to differing capital pool and other circumstances: the RR is much more interesting and telling), [here's how the strategy panned out over the past week.](https://i.imgur.com/SONZq9p.png) Breaking it down, [here's the SPY performance over the period in question.](https://i.imgur.com/KB8ZgI6.png) From 02-03SEP, we closed red by -$.11. Coming out of the long weekend, we closed by -$1.62. If you recall the strategy, this would have triggered an option buy, **but my risk tolerance made me wait an additional day.** I wasn't comfortable with only an initial drop of less then .03%, as it didn't represent the volatility I need for successful execution, so I elected to discard 02SEP and start the clock on 07SEP as the first \"true\" red day. With 08SEP closing red as our \"new\" second day, I bought my [option](https://i.imgur.com/xrm0KzC.png) around close (competing requirements made me buy early which reduced potential earnings). Since the following day opened slightly below the close, I assumed I would be rolling at EoD, but elected to sell near the beginning of the open when it crested the previous close for a net $150. [Wash,](https://i.imgur.com/wS2UZz5.png) rinse, and [repeat.](https://i.imgur.com/r2njwxM.png)\n\n**I fully acknowledge the role luck plays in this.** Strategizing and understanding what you're doing and *why* is important but they don't make you an oracle when things line up for you. I got very lucky by not considering 03SEP a red day, and luckier still than daily work requirements necessitated me pulling out early and avoiding the intraday dumps. Furthermore, the strategy employed and backtested only provides a *framework* for trading, as I did not execute the strategy as backtested - let your personal circumstances and risk tolerance dictate your decisions, rather than pre-deciding a course of action and aligning your RT on the backend.\n\n**Questions/Concerns**\n\nThere were several questions and points of criticism in the [original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/pmhcif/my_favorite_loweffort_lowriskish_spy_options/), so I'll address a few here for clarity (names withheld to protect the innocent):\n\n* Varied \"you backtested buying the dip in a bullmarket, why didn't you test it in a bear market/you're an idiot/we're due for a bear market and you're gonna lose money/if you would have done this strategy in 20XX you'd be broke.\"\n\nI chose not to test this in either a historical  bear market because *it wouldn't work*. This is firmly a bull market strategy, and no strategy will suit every market condition that exists. If one did then it would be discovered and it no longer would work. There are innumerable signals to signify a sharp downturn or correction, and when those signals present themselves I'll cease running the strategy- it's that simple. Yes, if I have a trade open at that time, or series of trades, I will lose money on those discrete sets - offset by the money I have already made (this is where RR comes into play). It's all about scaling and risk tolerance; if I had sat out the past 6mo running this strategy for fear of an impending drop then I would have missed out on the gains already accrued.\n\n* \"You didn't account for futures pricing.\"\n\nYou're right, and I chose not to include them in the test because 1) limited time and 2) *I don't care.* This is a simple strategy for a simple man, and they're accounted for already in the theoretical underpinnings of the strat simply by virtue of the fact that [SPY moves overnight (by virtue of futures and AH/PM).](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Os26.png) By counting on gaps up between close/open, and knowing the futures will give me an indication of how I will act upon market open, the futures and PM hours are the bedrock of the strategy but immaterial for accounting purposes.\n\n* Timeframe\n\nIf it wasn't clear from the original, the timeframe was 10SEP20 - 10SEP21. Yes, an insane bull market that is strategy is tailored for (see above) and no, it would not work in a downward trending market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, thanks to everyone for checking it out and if I can make anything clearer please let me know. If there are two things I want people to take away from this, it isn't the strategy itself but 1) you have to be adaptable to changing conditions (whether market, risk tolerance, etc) and not stay married to a strat when those conditions change and 2) you can't let the fear of change prevent you from moving - if everyone who was convinced COVID would signal the downfall of our market long-tem and sat out from \\~APR20-onward, they would have left serious gains on the table. *Develop your signals, develop your strategy, let them guide you, and adjust when needed.*",

        "selftext": "Shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) dropped nearly 2% in after-hours trading Monday after the software company posted mixed earnings.\n\nThe Good: Earnings per share in the quarter reached $1.03, better than the projection of $0.97. Guidance for the upcoming fiscal year was also strong.\n\nThe Bad: Oracle reported revenue of $9.73 billion, short of the projection of $9.75 billion. And while the company\u2019s cloud business grew, it did not keep up with competitors.\n\nNumbers: Oracle\u2019s share price is near an all-time high. It is up 39% in 2021, but down 2% during the last month.\n\nFinal Thoughts: It is clear that Oracle is not the most loved legacy tech company. While revenue is up year-over-year, its competitors are growing faster. Oracle needs to catch up.\n\nHope you enjoyed this commentary.

        "selftext": "Since there has been quite a bit of interest and criticism from the [original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/pmhcif/my_favorite_loweffort_lowriskish_spy_options/), I thought I'd create another post to clear some things up and address concerns + show how I've applied it.\n\n**Applied Strategy**\n\nFirst, there were several questions on how I've applied it specifically, and even more about how the past few days/week has affected my plays. Short answer: it hadn't. Longer answer: real-life application is going to differ from a backtest unless you're an algo with sufficient AUM and leverage to let the strat take advantage of the statistical edge (58% in our case). Your own circumstances are going to dictate how you trade, and likely aren't 1:1 with mine, but for clarity my current trading plans are affected by:\n\n* I'm leaving my job in less than two months. I'll have a period of planned unemployment, but my primary financial concern is capital preservation; thus, I'm much more conservative and risk adverse currently.\n* I still do have to work (CST) and am generally in the office between 8-830AM when the market opens. I can generally squeeze some time to myself at open, but with the intraday volatility we've been seeing in SPY, coupled with my risk aversion, I've trended towards closing at open if the open price exceeds closing.\n\nSince P/L is so interesting to everyone (although it shouldn't be due to differing capital pool and other circumstances: the RR is much more interesting and telling), [here's how the strategy panned out over the past week.](https://i.imgur.com/SONZq9p.png) Breaking it down, [here's the SPY performance over the period in question.](https://i.imgur.com/KB8ZgI6.png) From 02-03SEP, we closed red by -$.11. Coming out of the long weekend, we closed by -$1.62. If you recall the strategy, this would have triggered an option buy, **but my risk tolerance made me wait an additional day.** I wasn't comfortable with only an initial drop of less then .03%, as it didn't represent the volatility I need for successful execution, so I elected to discard 02SEP and start the clock on 07SEP as the first \"true\" red day. With 08SEP closing red as our \"new\" second day, I bought my [option](https://i.imgur.com/xrm0KzC.png) around close (competing requirements made me buy early which reduced potential earnings). Since the following day opened slightly below the close, I assumed I would be rolling at EoD, but elected to sell near the beginning of the open when it crested the previous close for a net $150. [Wash,](https://i.imgur.com/wS2UZz5.png) rinse, and [repeat.](https://i.imgur.com/r2njwxM.png)\n\n**I fully acknowledge the role luck plays in this.** Strategizing and understanding what you're doing and *why* is important but they don't make you an oracle when things line up for you. I got very lucky by not considering 03SEP a red day, and luckier still than daily work requirements necessitated me pulling out early and avoiding the intraday dumps. Furthermore, the strategy employed and backtested only provides a *framework* for trading, as I did not execute the strategy as backtested - let your personal circumstances and risk tolerance dictate your decisions, rather than pre-deciding a course of action and aligning your RT on the backend.\n\n**Questions/Concerns**\n\nThere were several questions and points of criticism in the [original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/pmhcif/my_favorite_loweffort_lowriskish_spy_options/), so I'll address a few here for clarity (names withheld to protect the innocent):\n\n* Varied \"you backtested buying the dip in a bullmarket, why didn't you test it in a bear market/you're an idiot/we're due for a bear market and you're gonna lose money/if you would have done this strategy in 20XX you'd be broke.\"\n\nI chose not to test this in either a historical  bear market because *it wouldn't work*. This is firmly a bull market strategy, and no strategy will suit every market condition that exists. If one did then it would be discovered and it no longer would work. There are innumerable signals to signify a sharp downturn or correction, and when those signals present themselves I'll cease running the strategy- it's that simple. Yes, if I have a trade open at that time, or series of trades, I will lose money on those discrete sets - offset by the money I have already made (this is where RR comes into play). It's all about scaling and risk tolerance; if I had sat out the past 6mo running this strategy for fear of an impending drop then I would have missed out on the gains already accrued.\n\n* \"You didn't account for futures pricing.\"\n\nYou're right, and I chose not to include them in the test because 1) limited time and 2) *I don't care.* This is a simple strategy for a simple man, and they're accounted for already in the theoretical underpinnings of the strat simply by virtue of the fact that [SPY moves overnight (by virtue of futures and AH/PM).](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Os26.png) By counting on gaps up between close/open, and knowing the futures will give me an indication of how I will act upon market open, the futures and PM hours are the bedrock of the strategy but immaterial for accounting purposes.\n\n* Timframe\n\nIf it wasn't clear from the original, the timeframe was 10SEP20 - 10SEP21. Yes, an insane bull market that is strategy is tailored for (see above) and no, it would not work in a downward trending market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, thanks to everyone for checking it out and if I can make anything clearer please let me know. If there are two things I want people to take away from this, it isn't the strategy itself but 1) you have to be adaptable to changing conditions (whether market, risk tolerance, etc) and not stay married to a strat when those conditions change and 2) you can't let the fear of change prevent you from moving - if everyone who was convinced COVID would signal the downfall of our market long-tem and sat out fron \\~APR20-onward, they would have left serious gains on the table. *Develop your signals, develop your strategy, let them guide you, and adjust when needed.*",
