        "selftext": "This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. \n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nThe dollar index after J. POW\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech. \ud83d\ude02 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\n**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**\n\nHere is one from Thursday, September 2.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5\n\n**$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\n**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**\n\nFor fucks sake people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n**\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d**\n\n**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026** \n\n             Wall Street\u2018a High Expectations\n\nSo far, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nThe strong results put the S&amp;P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. \ud83d\ude33 So\u2026. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings\u2026.which I guarantee that will happen\u2026 it\u2019s going to be an earnings miss galore. \n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\n**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nI like this one better compared to the DOW 30. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB\n\nThe lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\n**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\n**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you.**\n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\n**Let me be clear\u2026I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it\u2019s going to collapse our financial system possibly\u2026also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant \u201cMu\u201d and mass evictions will soon begin\u2026**\n\n**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\n**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don\u2019t get me started on the mass evictions as well\u2026and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities\u2026 The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**\n\nNow\u2026**my positions.** Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\n**Short term:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\n**Long term:**\n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\n**My last position:**\n\n**$2,500 in Cash.**\n\nSimply put\u2026**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!\n\n**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a \u201cBlack swan event\u201dby purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars\u2026Let me remind you that they deal with information.**\n\nI\u2019m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I\u2019m saying that maybe it\u2019s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don\u2019t forget Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1m\u2026 another bearish catalyst for the market\u2026 I literally could go on and on guys\u2026. It\u2019s pretty obvious at this point\u2026we\u2019ll at least to me, but what do I know, I just got out of prison last December. \n\nEdit:\nTLTR: just read the bold shit\u2026",

        "selftext": "The proposal, called the Stock Buyback Accountability Act, would levy a 2% excise tax on the amount corporations spend to buy back their own stock\u2014a common practice that returns funds to shareholders without generally requiring taxes. \n\nIn recent decades, cash-rich companies have used buybacks to reward stockholders and share-incented employees. Apple (ticker: APPL) spent over $400 billion on buybacks in the last 10 years, while Microsoft (MSFT) spent nearly $130 billion. Since 2017, annual spending on buybacks by companies in the S&amp;P 500 index totaled $650 billion each year, on average, according to an Aug. 6 report by J.P. Morgan quant analyst Dubravko Lakos-Bujas. Some 20% to 30% of those buybacks were funded with debt\u2014the rest with corporate cash.\n\nBrown and Wyden said the 2% excise tax would make corporations think twice about allocating capital to buybacks, instead of hiring or capital investment. Spending by the S&amp;P 500 companies on buybacks rose 11% from this year\u2019s March to June quarters, said J.P. Morgan\u2019s Lakos-Bujas. Capital expenditures rose 6%.

This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs. \n\nNo big deal right? \n\nThis is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks. https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\nMedian American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak. https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\nI mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. \n\nNow\u2026my positions. Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\nShort term: sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\nLong term: \n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS. You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\nMy last position:\n\n$2,500 in Cash.\n\nSimply put\u2026cash is a position. People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. Timing this is almost impossible\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!",

        "selftext": "*Disclaimer: This is my own speculation and opinion to kick off a discussion about Apple's future.*\n\nNo one here is a stranger to Apple's monstrous cash generation and profitability. It's been a behemoth of a stock and has basically guaranteed impressive returns for those long on it. With around a 2.1 trillion dollar market cap, it is the largest in the world. But has it gotten too big for its own good?\n\nApple is more or less known only for its iPhone and I don't know how anyone else feels but with the latest iPhone 13, nothing really feels much different or innovative. Better battery life? Camera? Storage? That's cool I guess, but nothing new that would make it stand out from its competitors. Apple has seen declining market share in the smartphone sector and it's a brutally competitive market. Nokia used to completely dominate the market back in the day and suddenly it became non-existent as it couldn't keep up with the innovation. It's like they got so cocky they were at the top and it backfired on them hard. I feel Apple is in a similar position where they are overestimating their strength with their absurd product prices and new releases like the iPhone 13 being more of the same. This is not sustainable. \n\nBecause Apple is so tremendously huge, it also makes it difficult for them to grow further without delving into something completely new that at the same time is big enough to move the needle. If Apple keeps doing what it's doing with new watches, air pods, iPhones, tablets, or what have you where not much is changing and they keep charging outrageous prices, they are bound to fail. I don't think their die-hard, cult-like fans will keep them propped up. \n\nIn my opinion, if Apple wants to facilitate further growth over the next 10 years, they need to do something insane. They have the cash. We've heard talks about an iCar; that is something radical that will drive growth if pulled off successfully. But it's extremely difficult, risky, and timely to get into that business. They need to do it right, otherwise I would expect hefty share price decline over the years. \n\nI genuinely think Apple's a fantastic company but I don't like the current direction they are heading and I have a hard time believing they are going to continue to grow as they have been if they continue doing the same stuff they've always been doing. I want to see them branch out to something completely revolutionary. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on Apple's future?",

        "selftext": "Gather around folks, hope y\u2019all made some gains the last time around. This DD is split into 8 parts, so feel free to jump to whichever section you\u2019re most interested in.\n\n**Part 1 \u2013 Introduction**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n**Part 3 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\n**Part 5 \u2013 Financials and Valuation**\n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\n**Part 1 \u2013 Introduction**\n\nIt was a warm Monday morning on August 23rd almost a month back, when seemingly for no reason \u2013 **GOEV shot up from ~$5.9 to ~$8, a 30% gain on the day.** The next day \u2013 GME popped, for a 30% gain as well, with AMC and BB also making up big gains, leading to the \u2018meme mania\u2019 we\u2019ve been experiencing for the last couple of weeks. \n\nWhy\u2019d this happen? Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there\u2019s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD\u2019s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for \u2018meme stocks\u2019 which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don\u2019t know, haven\u2019t investigated that particular theory but there\u2019s plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you\u2019re so inclined. \n\nThe quick point I\u2019m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question \u2013 and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule \u2013 seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems \u2013 for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n* From an investment into equities point of view \u2013 S&amp;P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month \u2014 other than a slight dip in February \u2014 over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) \n\n* Let\u2019s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it\u2019s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   \n\n* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) \n\n* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). \n\n* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. [link]( https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\n* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. \n\n* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) \n\n* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) \n\n* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  \n\n* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois\u2019 clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). \n\n* By 2030, there\u2019s expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market. [link](https://gyazo.com/66173e4431b4c6b30ac7ed0662f13f1c) \n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Before we look into what\u2019s happened since my last post, let\u2019s go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. \n\nIt is this modular platform that led to Apple\u2019s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car\u2019s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).\n\nApple wasn\u2019t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia\u2019s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as \u2018pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal\u2026 Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company\u2019 [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). \n\nUltimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo\u2019s chairman didn\u2019t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn\u2019t factor in the value of Canoo\u2019s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo\u2019s own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) \n\nRegarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo\u2019s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo\u2019s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). \n\nThe use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants\n\n* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nThese enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo\u2019s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 \u2013 layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) \n\nThe three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:\n\nLifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It\u2019s pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I\u2019d recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself.

Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category \u2013 you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  \n\n* Targeted HP \u2013 500+\n\n* Payload Capacity \u2013 1800 lbs\n\n* Range \u2013 200+ mi\n\n* Powertrain \u2013 AWD or RWD\n\nThere\u2019s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn\u2019t been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). \n\nWe can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It\u2019s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity \u2013 highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). \n\nCanoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer \u2013 with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 \u2013 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).\n\nTo sum it up \u2013 Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).\n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\n**Now let\u2019s take a look at some of the hires that the company\u2019s been making (note that almost all of these hires have happened since the last quarter, with most being in the last two months, and this is not an exhaustive list). Canoo has quietly been putting together an all-star management team experienced in three key areas \u2013 diplomacy, automotive, and technology.**\n\n* [Ambassador Josette Sheeran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josette-sheeran-a5935837/) \u2013 President at Canoo, Executive Chairman at the The McCain Institute, former UN Special Envoy for Haiti, Vice Chairman of the World Economic Forum, Executive Director of the World Food Programme, Undersecretary for Economics Agriculture, Energy at the US Department of State.\n\n* [Ram Balasubramanian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ram-balasubramanian/) - Chief Information Officer at Canoo, former Senior Vice President, Business Technology at Salesforce, Chief Information Officer at Motorola Solutions, Chief Information Officer (CIO), India Region, Global Business Solutions Leader at PepsiCo.\n\n* [Christian Treiber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-treiber-252b3280/) - Senior Vice President of Global Customer Journey &amp; Aftersales at Canoo, former Member of the Board of Directors at the German American Chamber of Commerce, Inc., Member of the Board of Directors, RepairSmith (backed by Daimler AG), Vice President Customer Service, Mercedes-Benz USA, Member of the Supervisory Board at Mercedes-Benz Versicherungs AG, Director, Service and Parts Sales Mercedes-Benz Passenger Cars at Daimler AG etc.\n\n* [Govin Ranganathan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/govinranganathan/) - Director Logistics, Materials &amp; Transportation at Canoo, former Head of Logistics at Nio, Engineering Manager at Tesla, Sr. Manager of Production Control at Fiat Chrysler, Lean Manufacturing Specialist at Damien Chrysler. \n\n* [Arnold Abernathy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnold-abernathy-9713745/) - Chief Information Security Officer at Canoo, former Deputy Chief Information Security Officer at Toyota, Programmer at NASA, with other experience including McAfee, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young, CA technologies.\n\n* [Randy Rodriguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/randyrodriguezdesign/) - Director of Advanced Design at Canoo, former Director of Advanced Design at General Motors, Creative Manager Design and Styling at Tesla, Project Lead Designer at Nissan Motor Corporation.\n\n* [Senon Franco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/senon-franco-ba52b423) \u2013 Senior Exterior Design Manager at Canoo, former Senior Exterior Designer at Hyundai, Creative Designer at Honda, Exterior Designer at GM, Exterior Designer at VW.\n\n* [Branden Cot\u00e9](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandencote/) - Vice President Product Management &amp; Sales at Canoo, former Director, Market Management North America &amp; Greater China at Mercedes-AMG\n\n* [Bryce DeArmond](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryce-d/) - Manager of Strategic Partnerships, Data Customer Journey at Canoo, Former Account Manager at Samsung Electronics America, Samsung Field Operations Manager at Samsung Electronics America, Director of Sales at IRIO.\n\n* [Kristen Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristyharris/) - Senior Commercial Counsel at Canoo, former Director, Legal Affairs for EMEA and Latin America at the Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Regional Legal Counsel at Texas Instruments, Legal Consultant at Taiwan International Patent and Law Office \n\n**Now why on earth would these long-established and assumingly well-reputed individuals with executive level careers at places including the United Nations, U.S. Department of State, Nio, Tesla, Fiat Chrysler, Daimler AG/Mercedez-Benz, General Motors, Nissan, Toyota, Hyundai, Honda, Salesforce, NASA, McAfee, PepsiCo, Samsung, Harley-Davidson etc. move to an upstart EV manufacturer within the last couple of months if they didn\u2019t believe in it\u2019s potential for success?

The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).\n\nPartnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US &amp; EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar \u2018is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone.\u201d The Nedcar facility is slated to build up to 1000 units for both the US and European markets in 2022 with a target of 15,000 units in 2023 [link]( https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)\n\nDe-risking the path to market, Canoo designed, built and tested beta for its lifestyle vehicle [link](https://gyazo.com/e9e9bee044f83da1536c1ab57809dece), with highlights including:\n\n* &gt;$250M invested in Beta\n\n* ~1.5M hours of engineering\n\n* ~500k miles of testing\n\n* 13 beta runners / 32 beta properties tested\n\n* US NCAP 5-star overall rating targeted, with simulated, sled and vehicle level crash testing.\n\nUndertaking the Gamma Phase with SOP on track for Q4 2022 [link]( https://gyazo.com/772813dd1ab4b30255dfdfa9674006ce), with key highlights including:\n\n* &gt;12 months of testing\n\n* ~120-150 vehicles will be built and validated\n\n* ~70 crash tests\n\n* 30 sled tests\n\n* Full slate of vehicle tests; no shortcuts\n\n* 80% of all components are sourced\n\n* 63% of all engineering is released\n\n* 54% of tooling is committed\n\nPartnering with the frontdoor collective for 10,000 MPDVs, the frontdoor collective are a network of delivery service partners that provide dependable last-mile delivery experience, with founders and executives with experience from FedEx, Walmart, XPO, Amazon, Instacart and the U.S. military.

Lafferty - $19 [link](https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124) \n\n* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/) \n\n* Bank of America - $5 (can\u2019t find the article at the moment but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen it somewhere)\n\nAverage = $13, current SP = $6.7\n\nAs of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). \n\nThe company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.\n\nAt a pre-revenue stage there\u2019s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:\n\n* Over 9,500 non-binding preorders \u2013 which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).\n\n* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).\n\nAs far as valuations go, let\u2019s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look \u2013 based on their market cap. I\u2019m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I\u2019ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.\n\n* Lucid Motors \u2013 $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021\n\n* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 \n\n* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, &gt;17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 \n\n* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 \n\n* Canoo \u2013 $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV \n\n* Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B\n\nJust looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven\u2019t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there\u2019s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo\u2019s cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).  \n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\nWith anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that\u2019s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I\u2019m on the bullish side for the company, I\u2019ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won\u2019t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market \u2013 these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I\u2019ll summarize them below:\n\n* As of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. \n\n* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.\n\n* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.\n\n* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production \u2013 H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to go the additional equity route.\n\n* In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) \u2013 nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\nI know y\u2019all have just been waiting for this so I\u2019ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that\u2019ll help understand GOEV\u2019s squeezability.\n\n* Short Interest \u2013 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float \n\n* Market Cap \u2013 $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it\u2019s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital\n\n* Extremely Memeable \u2013 I mean\u2026 GOEV, like Go\u2026 EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria\n\n* Low Liquidity \u2013 Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)\n\n* Low Risk (IV) \u2013 Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you\u2019re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by /u/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it\u2019s not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There\u2019s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn\u2019t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I\u2019d agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\nThe global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. \n\nPresident Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at &lt;$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. \n\nCanoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.\n\nTo facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)\n\n* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nIf we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it\u2019s $4,000 rebate \u2013 that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you\u2019re getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.\n\nIf you made it this far, I\u2019d like to thank you for reading this \u2013 I\u2019d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won\u2019t). They\u2019re extremely dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company \u2013 from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups. Y\u2019all the real MVPs. Position \u2013 1k shares @ 11.69.",

        "selftext": "I have been avidly learning the great minds of WallStreetBets and have gained extensive knowledge on investing, risk management, and portfolio growth. WSB has introduced me to the great world of options, and it has completely changed my life. \n\n**Pre-WSB**\nI am ashamed to admit\u2026 but I used to be a\u2026 *Boglehead*. In my early investing days (~5 months ago) the dinosaur Vanguard lentil eaters told me it is *impossible* to beat the market. They all accepted an early defeat that they\u2019ll never be rich, so they default to 6% yearly returns and averaging into the occasional 40% crash. Rather than risking my money on something *totally risky* like Apple (which holds $300B+ in cash and literally only goes up), I should own Apple and 5000 other companies that nobody knows or cares about.\n\nUnfortunately, these boomers convinced me and I threw my entire portfolio into VT and BND. \u201cOwn the market and you will get rich\u2026. when you\u2019re 500 years old\u201d. After holding for 2 weeks and losing 1.3%, I sold all my shares and started a new adventure. \n\n\n**Learning from WSB**\nAs I came to WSB, I saw a skilled trader lose $100k in seconds. His life: destroyed. In the next post, I saw another investor make $100k in seconds. His life: changed! I was in awe. The Bogleheads made me lose 1.2% of my account and told me to \u201chold for the next 60 years\u201d. Meanwhile I saw someone make 10,000% in a few minutes on some SPY calls. So I did what any logical person would do and opened a Robinhood account. I promptly applied for options, and Vlad personally gave me approval. He told me that life in Bulgaria was very difficult, but through options he was able to get out of the poor eurozone and into the United States. \n\nMy first trade was a massive success. I made 20% on an SPY call. I made 3 years worth of the Bogleheads dream in minutes. These losers can\u2019t compete. In the subsequent few months, I have 100x my account. Through a series of 0-1 DTE SPY calls, I have found great success trading complex financial derivatives that I do not understand. It\u2019s amazing. My life has been changed and I cannot thank WSB enough. \n\n\n**THANK YOU**\nI would like to thank WSB for fundamentally changing my life. Not only have you made me 100x richer, but you have taught me the importance of risk taking. I would still be a Vanguard boglehead loser if I didn\u2019t discover the power of 0-1DTE SPY calls (I do not buy puts since they\u2019re anti-American \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcaa). If WSB was not filled with such intellectuals, I would have not trusted the numerous great DDs.\n\nThis leads me to my question:\n**Why doesn\u2019t everyone trade options?**\nI don\u2019t think it makes sense to buy and hold something for DECADES and hope for a 100% return after 20 years. I have made 100x in 3 months and could not imagine how pathetic I would look still holding VT and BND. I have leveraged all my accounts through a series of all in trades. I now have a Tesla arriving soon all thanks to the YOLO and WSB. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t everyone do this?! It seems like free money.",

        "selftext": "Lehman brothers was a critical part of the financial system that, when it went down, caused credit freezes that domino'd into more financial crisis. Due to the nature of their business, it makes sense them blowing up could really domino, but..\n\nEvergrande is just a real estate developer. Investors will get screwed, sure, but how can this really cause financial dominos like in 2008? The bears seem really excited about this and keep posting articles and charts about how BLK and other US and international firms are the biggest bagolders. But when I look further into this I see that these firms are hardly exposed. It's pennies in their portfolios and probably less than they'd lose on a bad 1 minute candle in the equity markets.\n\nThey quote the $300b worth of bonds that will be worthless, but that's not that much to the global economy, realistically. More wealth is destroyed on a bad day for $AAPL. Additionally these were junk bonds for a long time. Were not talking triple a mortgage bonds that were \"too big to fail\" and unsinkable like the titanic.\n\nThis all also assumes that the chinese government will sit on their hands and watch a crisis unfold, when that seems super unlikely. Say what you will about the CCP, but they're not gonna let all their stellar economic growth crumble when they have:\n1. More power and political will than the US did to tackle such a crisis\n2. The ability to plan their economy to recover from any domino effects unlike more \"free market\" economies \n3. Knowledge of previous global housing crashes/financial crises to draw from\n\nMaybe I'm an idiot but I just don't see how anybody should think this will cause a serious bear market in the US or elsewhere. Chinese stocks are already beat down hard so I can't see those selling off too much more either. I'm inclined to buy the dip if it keeps dippening into this week. I'm lucky to have increased my cash and entered some shorts last week at least.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

These small 20-5 cent fighhts each day dont mean shit to me.\n\nAnother example , tesla oh shit its been inthe 600-700 range for a while , idc cause im holding for a few years.\n\nInvesting is buying into a company that you believe due to dd is going to be worth more over the long run and you  **dont give 2 fucks about the daily /weekly price battles.** \n\ntrading on the other hand is = whats the catalyst? Trading is in my opinion figuring out what the catalyst us and using that catalyst ti your advantage.\n\nHere let me put it like this spce had a catalyst which was that launch thing(space mission) . Tradrers bought a position before the launch and after the launch they sold off. Really it was right b4 the launch actually happened. But you see what i mean. \n\nShit nvidia had a stock split announcement , thats a catalyst for traders to buy lots of shares of it and sell off on the split date.  Again trading on a catalyst .\n\nShit the catalyst could be a TA for instance netflix was trading in a 500-600 channel. When netflix dropped close to its support traders bought into it as it bounced off the 500 support and ran back to the 600 resistance ... yall see?\n\n**Trading is finding a catalyst for a stock and then figuring out how it will effect the stock price in the short term and using it to your advantage.**\n\nTHis isnt financial advice. This is just a bunch of my opinions i want to share with yall",

        "selftext": "A lot of people said Tesla is an \"AI\" company, not an electric car company from this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney\\_is\\_to\\_netflix\\_as\\_x\\_is\\_to\\_tesla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney_is_to_netflix_as_x_is_to_tesla/)\n\nThe thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up. And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.\n\nMy thoughts are below. Agree or disagree?\n\n* Self-driving tech will be a commodity, not concentrated in a few\n* Carmakers who can't create their own will license it from third parties like Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, and [40+ other companies.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/autonomous-driverless-vehicles-corporations-list/)\n* If 40+ companies are looking to create this tech, it shows that self-driving is hard but still doable for so many companies big and small. This is an indication that there isn't any moat in self-driving capabilities.\n* There is actually a Udemy course on creating a self-driving car. No, you can't take this course and then create an autonomous car on the road. But it is a sign that self-driving capabilities will be a commodity that many companies will have. There isn't a Udemy course on how to create a Facebook competitor with billions of users. That's moat. Self-driving doesn't have moat.\n* I live in San Francisco, and Cruise, Waymo, Uber (before they sold their unit), Apple, and a few others have been testing self-driving cars on the road for 4-5 years. It's very common to see a self-driving car (with a driver) on the road here that is not a Tesla.\n* Regarding data gathering advantage: Companies can gather data without selling cars. Waymo has been doing this for a decade. No car company is going to release self-driving software expecting it to have deficiencies and expecting data gathered from consumers to fix those deficiencies. This isn't like a beta app. It's life and death. No one wants to be in a beta self-driving car.  All self-driving cars will meet a minimum standard due to regulation.\n* If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla. They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.",

Chinese banks, homeowners, and hedge funds invested in Chinese stocks are freaking out right now. In all likelihood, Evergrande will default and get bailed out by the Chinese government. It is believed that the Evergrande default crisis will cause people to panic take their money out the Chinese stock market and put their money into American stocks. This sudden increase in demand for shares in U.S. will likely cause the share prices of U.S. blue chips to rise. I can imagine stocks such as Disney and Apple increasing as a result of investors switching to U.S. stocks.

        "selftext": "Affirm reports earnings tonight and is expected to report USD 226m in revenue, which would be a decrease from their Q1 revenue of USD 231m. Guidance for Q3 is expected to hit 233m. I think the expectations are lowballed and Affirm will outdo them. The price has cooled down a bit since its recent jump, and this stock has already seen a lot of volume at higher prices than it is at today.\n\n**Increasing consumer adoption**\n\nWhen Afterpay started becoming successful, Affirm started attempts to move towards being a consumer company in a similar vein, which seems to be paying off now. Their app downloads this Quarter were the best they have ever been, and much higher than in the same quarter of last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6acfw397jhm71.png?width=1615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee1c355673cb256324d8a2ebd159b03fbf0a510e\n\n**Partners outdoing expectations**\n\nAffirm's biggest customer is Peloton who just had a mixed quarter. However hardware sales were still solid and I don't think the product recall will be taken up by too many people. Walmart and Target both just had big quarters, as well as the travel industry were travel bookings were up bigly in Q2 (although the outlook of those is a bit more mixed now with the Delta variant), Bestbuy, Figs, etc.. Referrals to Affirm's website from partners (what happens when you click on the \"Pay with Affirm\" button on e.g. Walmart's website) increased steadily since the beginning of this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lf7lxywtkhm71.png?width=1349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c83faf99687fef4a1efc8b446181f461123a4fa\n\n**Industry trends in BNPL favoring Affirm**\n\nWith partnerships with Amazon and Shopify, Affirm is now a fixed player in ecommerce. Those companies prefer to keep the number of payment options low, so it is unlikely they will ever add more BNPL companies/loaners or replace Affirm. Affirm is now tied to 4 out of the Top 5 ecommerce companies and just launched a Canadian partnership with the 5th one (Apple). Affirm is probably the only pure play BNPL provider that can't be commoditized away. There will be some more consolidation to come for sure and I think these markets are pretty hot right now.\n\n**Positions**\n\nSince IV is quite high for my taste, I decided to go with a bull spread for this play. I'm pretty confident that numbers will be good and the stock price will at least be stable. I reach my maximum profit if Affirm is trading over 90 by expiry. Maximum profit and loss are both 24k. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulq92qy77im71.png?width=301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc3fe5c68aa32c1c7ee84ca049707382bd233a39",

        "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nSo I just recently got into the stock market and had a weird occurrence when I first started talking to people about stocks. \n\nThis all started because I lost my job during the pandemic, had no way to make money and was struggling to pay my rent. I started with small trades, $50 into Tesla, $100 into Apple, just starting with companies that I was comfortable with. \n\nNow, I have expanded my portfolio into almost every industry ranging from marijuana to healthcare. But I am struggling with one thing, the woman. I was told that if I wore a suit and went to a bar and talked about stocks, that girls would want to sleep with me. That is simply not the case for me, as I have not gotten any action since the pandemic. I am not sure if it\u2019s because I am talking about the wrong stocks that don\u2019t get women excited? Or if I am using the wrong terminology when discussing the market. \n\nI could use help because the main reason I got into the stock market was to pickup women, and yet I have managed to lose almost my whole income without getting any action. \n\nAny help would be appreciated as I am close to losing my house. \n\nThanks.",

        "selftext": "This is another weekly update on my small account challenge I started to share with the public on 8/24/21 ([initial reddit post available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ph6gjf/is_this_scalping_style_sustainable_in_the/). Update 2 post is [directly available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/pln76c/small_account_scalping_trader_weekly_update_2/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took 7 trades this week. All 7 trades were winners.\n\nI'm at 31 winners / 1 losing trade out of the 32 combined. My win rate, according to TraderSync (a journaling system), is at 96.88%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get it. The internet is huge. So is reddit. There will always be believers and non-believers. I don't even know why I am starting out with this type of tone if you will in my post today, but I think a lot of people want some kind of closure, something that allows them to see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to day-trading. It might be based on the fact that that some so-called \"day-traders\" are more successful than others. Some have tried it and failed miserably and consider it a strict gamble. Here's what I can tell you. Everything in life is truly a gamble. Drive a car to work, get into an accident and you could end up dead. Go to eat out at a restaurant while you're not aware of any allergies to shellfish, and you end up dead. You invest money long-term into the market and then decide to pull everything out at retirement because you're now old and ready to enjoy the rest of the final years of your life, but the market happens to plunge 75% - you're pretty much \"dead\" now because you've lost almost all of your money that you planned on retiring on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in terms of day-trading: Just don't gamble. DAY-TRADE. It is a LEARNED skill. Have a trading plan AND execute on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally don't ever expect anyone to prove to me how they trade or whether they're truly profitable or just trading on a paper account when I go over someone else's post/comment. I like to think of it as keeping an open mind. There is plenty to learn from other people, whether positively or negatively. The important thing is to learn and to improve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is how this small account challenge started. Initially it started with $497.50, but after 3 trades, I decided to add an additional 2,000 to make things more interesting and quicker. If you want to round it up, you can say that this challenge's debut was with 2,500.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a snapshot of the recent entries on the account statement if interested (or as proof).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4 weeks into this, I've netted $448, $572, $496 and $502 each of those weeks respectively (on a $2,500 account) after fees and commission. If I'm being completely vague on this, I could say I'm almost at 100% of profit trading for 160 minutes in total (32 trades taken, rounding up/down to 5 minutes per trade) the past 4 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone truly day-trading the past 4 weeks knows how this market has behaved. I consider this market a fun environment to day-trade in because of more increased volatility, especially right at market open. Remember, this is how I (prefer to) trade. You should adapt to your own trading style based on your own trading experience, knowledge, expertise, risk tolerance, trading capital and make it work for yourself. If you keep and are true to yourself, and continue to work on following YOUR trading plan, you can get there too. Nothing in life is easy. Give yourself plenty of time to learn this. This journey has no end. The goal is to be consistent and continue to grow the account over time. A steady rising equity curves is what you really want to help your proper mindset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are the 3 trades I took this morning alongside with my daily routine/thoughts:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in Central time zone. I woke up at 6:45am. Turned on the TV as I like to wake up listening to Squawk Box. Not necessarily for trading tips (we all know how bad their tips are), but mainly for potential news regarding upcoming FED talks, any kind of catalysts that might affect how the markets might behave this morning. I remained in bed listening, half asleep, half awake for approx. 45 minutes while checking on other things on my phone (emails, schedule of the day, read up on some other people's reddit posts for entertainment and to get my mind to literally wake up). Now it's 7:30. Time to get up. I proceed to go brush my teeth, take my morning dump and head over to the trading station. 8:05am, I'm now just sitting there sipping on coffee. Getting my mind ready to go over my own trading rules. I repeat them on a daily basis to set the right expectations, the right mindset. It is important to follow a routine.\n\n8:20, I launch my thinkorswim platform, then I continue to sip on coffee while I literally watch the red countdown of the remaining 5 minutes before market bell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing long on AMZN was almost a no-brainer to me. If you stick to certain tickers that you watch and follow daily, you understand that AMZN has behaved differently in recent days than some other QQQ components. Always keep an eye out of the price of the options you're about to buy in as a scalping trader. Your risk is set at ENTRY. I jumped in with 3 contracts on 3600 Calls expiring next week at 4.30 a pop., sold them about 2 minutes later for 4.70. Yes, money is always left on the table (went as high as 5.76), but as a scalping trader you should be more focused on what happens most of the time (aka most mornings, most market opens), not what can possibly be an outlier move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that initial quick $120 gain, I can now simply take a look at my other watchlist tickers, scroll through them with a glance and see if I cannot spot another trading opportunity. I immidiately noticed FB and AAPL and had high interest in playing both short. I ended up deciding going with AAPL just because of recent (negative) news, especially with market weak on this Friday. I jumped in on 5 contracts at 1.63 and set my exit price for just 15 cents higher, and simply wait for it to fill me, but 4 minutes into the trade, I realize it might take a little longer for that push further down, so I adjust my fill price for just 10 cents, and get out of the trade. No need to worry how much extra I could have made, etc, etc. That is not helping you as a scalping trader for your mindset long-term. Just enter a trading opportunity and execute your exit as needed based on your trading plan. I don't mind taking $50 from AAPL in 4 minutes because I know I could do that over and over and those $50 bills do stack up quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast trade I took was simply just to make back the commission fees I spent today on both preceeding scalp trades on AMZN and AAPL. I decide to play for a rebound on AAPL with a weekly call option expiring today. It was pretty much ATM. 7-10 cents scalp there would have easily paid for the commission today. Again, it turns out, it wasn't moving quick enough for me, so I bail on the trade just a minute or two later. Still profitable, trade literally does not bother me at all. I already made what I think is a healthy/hefty amount for this morning trading for what, perhaps 10 minutes total in 3 trades. I'll just continue doing this every morning, every day, with the same routine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope by sharing this today can help and motivate some other traders, especially if they haven't performed well this week from their own trading. I embrace every market condition every morning. Market could open green or red and it doesn't bother me the slighest. Going into each trade with the right mindset is immensely helpful and a much required skill to learn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's really crazy is, I've already spent a little over 1.5 hours literally writing up this update post, along with getting screenshots together and making the post looking nice and neat than it takes me to do my actual daily trades. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's hope I help more than 1 person out there achieve better trading with this.",

It would simply be more difficult for Apple to collect that commission,\u201d Rogers writes. \n\nEnd of quotes.\n\nThe judge clearly states that Apple deserves compensation for hosting an App even if payment is made outside the App store. \n\nApple can still charge the 30% commission according to the judge even if alternate payment is used. \n\nThe App Store clearly states the 30% commission is due regardless if Apples payment system is used or not.

With that being said, I\u2019m not sure which company is in the best position to take market share from Tesla (I guess this is the million dollar question) and was wondering if anybody had advice. I was thinking FORD or GM, but they both have so much debt that it might be hard for them to heavily transition into EV. Apple is going to move into EV\u2019s, but I\u2019m already heavily invested in them for other reasons.",

        "selftext": "Good evening everyone and thank you so much for reading my posts. There are debates everywhere abou TSLA valuation so I am not here to go into that. It should be noted that TSLA now has a market cap higher than the combination of Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Honda all combined. It should also be noted that Toyota alone sells nearly 10 million cars and Tesla 500k\u2026..\n\nThis post is not about that though\u2026however Cathie Wood says that TSLA should be worth 3,000 easy, in her base case. \\[Mind you she just dumped\u2026 along with insiders that sell every day of the week check form 4\\] Whatever is the case if TSLA is 3,000 a share it will rival the largest company in the world AAPL. Nearly 2.5 trillion\u2026\n\nTSLA is thought as of the car/tech of the future\u2026Many believe that APPLE is the best innovator\u2026 It has been rumored over a year that Apple has plans to possibly team up with a car manufacturer and make an APPLE car\u2026.\n\nSo the question is simple. If both cars come out, both cars are near the same price\u2026be honest which do you buy? This happened with Blackberry, Iphone and Samsung\u2026\n\nThank you for taking the time.

        "selftext": "Alright let me explain something.\n\nPeople are on here complaining saying \u201coh why are all these stocks being discussed\u201d, WSB isn\u2019t the same. \u201cI remember when we used to only YOLO on solid fundamental companies like TSLA &amp; APPLE so that if you fucked up your trade at least your not bagholding\u201d.\n\nFirst off, shut the fuck up. I do agree that the sentiment has changed a bit since prior to January 2020, but do you even know what WSB is about?\n\nIt\u2019s about finding good trades that can like 5x to 10x your profits which also comes with high risk aka High Risk, High Reward trades \u2026 like 1-0DTE SPY calls or puts.\n\nI\u2019m not pushing $IRNT here, but I\u2019m holding my bag until next week to see what happens. I think with its setup, high OI% for October, high SI%, and high CTB% that there\u2019s something unique to come of it, \u201cpotentially\u201d.\n\nFuck for a lot of you on here, prior to two weeks ago had no idea what a super 8-k was or a company completing a stock redemption from a DeSpac.\n\nI\u2019m in full exceptante of the L\u2019s I take as it was my choice to partake. I can imagine posters of DD getting flack from people not getting \u201cGaINs\u201d or losing a fuck ton of money blame posters or ask them questions like, hey man I just dropped a bag on this stock how fucked am I? No one is going to answer you. That was your choice to play that play.\n\nPeople complaining of stocks in this sub-reddit this week and saying ah man I miss the old days; when 95% of you weren\u2019t even here back then.\n\nYou want to know why the DeSpacs high redemption are being discussed? Because of their Super 8-k (Redemption) and Option Chain activity.\n\nThese types of stocks can lead to gamma squeezes and high return for those who got in early before IV and on the run up when the stock was illiquid and IV is low, if that stock pops off, again, High Risk to High Reward plays, then that make sense.\n\nFor example, until lock up expires for the PIPE investors, I\u2019ll use $IRNT as an example, it still has absurd Option Chain activity for October, high short interest, high CTB, closed at $30 which indicates to me dumb money is still holding strong, and a very small float that moves easily and has been proven to do so.\n\nSo, for me I\u2019m rolling the dice and playing this into next week to see. But here\u2019s the thing, I ChOsE tO tAkE tHaT rIsK \u2026 because I knew why I was going into that trade and if I get burnt that\u2019s on me and me only, there\u2019s no else to blame but myself and some of you pussies are forgetting that.\n\nDeSpacs are hot right now because some of them have potential to make good money if your lucky and smart.\n\nPlays like $IRNT are unique and if anything remind me more of old WSB then the current buy $WISH or buy $CLNE type shit.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting plays out there as of lately, but don\u2019t ever bitch and complain to a Mod or Redditor because your down and didn\u2019t know why you got into  a trade.\n\nThis isn\u2019t fucking Safe\u2014Moon you quacks. If that\u2019s your mentality then go join a subreddit similar to that.\n\nThis is a place where we take bets on trades that have at least some form of logical reasoning as a catalyst to occur.\n\nWhether it be an Option Chain activity, highly shorted with a catalyst, Overbought, Calls or Puts because of JPowws money printer goes Brrrr, etc.\n\nIf you can\u2019t eat a loss based on your own decision gracefully, and go straight to blaming others, then get the fuck out this sub.\n\nSincere regards,",

        "selftext": "Sup retards, it\u2019s your boi Ropirito, back with another life-changing play. You may have seen my recent $SPY 100P 100 Bagger play which is of course the greatest hedge in existence to date or older plays like $ZIM and $WOOF. Basically, I clearly know what I\u2019m doing. \n\nToday I decided I\u2019m bored of YOLOing meme stocks and spent several hours jacking off until I could find the next play of the century. See, over this past year, I have had 5000% gains while in mid-June I dipped to 3000%. However, as of this week, I have finally recovered my bags and reached all-time highs at 7000% gains. \n\n[I'll be at 1000000&amp;#37; soon. ](https://preview.redd.it/hidiiraorym71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbfbae38250692d7e6dd860af20d74532df818b7)\n\nAs the post-nut clarity hit, I reached peak nirvana, utilizing the powers of u/1ronyman, u/SirYoloGod, and my own past of degeneracy to achieve Tim Cock levels of wealth (looks like $AAPL shit itself so maybe he\u2019s a poor now).  I have come up with the ultimate play to help every single person go from **Bags to Bitches**, just like I am. \n\nClimate change is taking over everything you hold near and dear. Extreme temperatures and the frequent cum shower from u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT have destroyed thousands of homes, businesses, and lives. Got a basement? You\u2019re fucked. Like food? You\u2019re fucked. Want a city job? You\u2019re fucked. (Good thing you won\u2019t need one after this play). \n\n[ This will probably happen next year and hurricane season peaks around now, so I think my plays are safe. ](https://preview.redd.it/dokmf1g2rym71.png?width=780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e8606bb9d234f81ef516dbbf9b0e1dafc6dfd38)\n\n **Where others find this to be sad, I find this to be BULLISH AS FUCK. It raises Bullcock Flags all around me and makes me wonder why you retards haven\u2019t made a play like this before.** \n\n**Bags to Bitches In 5 Steps:**\n\n1. I\u2019m going to recommend the forbidden fund. Invest 80% of your portfolio in PIMCO\u2019s [$PSLDX fund](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/mutual-funds/stocksplus-long-duration-fund/inst). Most brokerages have a minimum investment amount so you need at least $25k on boomer Vanguard. Don\u2019t be VOOrgin, buy PIMCO. **This fund gives 17-20% of boomer gains per year by beating SPY 2x over, over the past 2 years. They also crash less in case SPY somehow does go to $300 (SPY only goes up though).**  Using the available 2x leverage for mutual funds, I will put 200% of my account (as margin) into $PSLDX, giving me an **actual gain of 34 to 40% per year for free.** With an expense ratio of 0.59% and margin interest of around 4.5%, my final profits from this alone are **29% to 35%.** \n2. Next, I will take out the profits each month (about 2.5% to 3% of the entire port) and YOLO them into CME Weather Contracts. Wtf are those you ask? Well basically, you can bet on the weather, and more specifically, temperatures for various US and European cities. As we all know, just like how stocks only go up, average global temperatures also only go up now! \n3. At the end of each month, I will flip the current profits from my weather contracts into the PIMCO fund (estimated $1M) each time, and then further increase my monthly income by $20-30k. \n4. **Based on the compounding effect**, if I continue to take these 2-3% profits from $PSLDX and flip them to the appropriate weather contract each month, I will reach **$1.2B** in about 13 months, about 3 months earlier than u/SirYoloGod. \n5. Retire in Malta with lots of bitches. I\u2019m a sigma chad ofc so this part might be hard for a lot of you. \n\nNew York winters are milder now so I will be buying calls on the HDD (Heating Degree Day) futures contracts. This should give me approximately **570x leverage** on my position. Based on my calculations here is the payout as follows:\n\n**Stats:**\n\n* Timeframe: September 2021 - December 2021 (For now)\n* Seasonal 10-year average for New York: 3700\n* Strike prices: 4050\n* Option premium: $2000 per contract\n* Premium: $16,000 (max potential loss)\n* Max potential payout: $3,500,000 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jshj0pdarym71.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1024e8678041a592cf98d296fadcd747eeb2ee25\n\n\\### Furthermore, I challenge u/SirYoloGod in the race to $1B. May the best leverage god win.\n\n\\*\\*TLDR; I will be buying Weather Futures Options for maximum leverage and reach $1B in a little over a year.\\*\\*",

        "selftext": "So much false headlines in the media saying Apple won\u2019t be able to collect 30% if App Devs use alternative payment methods instead of Apples In App Purchases. Totally false.\n\nRead the judgement and the conclusion by the judge. Epic was ordered to pay 30% commission to Apple on the $12 million Epic collected outside of Apples IAP. Yes, Epic still has to pay 30% even though they used their own payment system.\n\nThe judge didn\u2019t rule that Apples 30% commission is illegal. She also didn\u2019t tie the 30% commission to payment method. So Devs still can\u2019t dodge the 30% commission even if they use an alternate payment system.\n\nYes, it will be harder for Apple to collect the fee. But most Devs won\u2019t bother since they would have to pay Apple 30% PLUS the credit card processor an additional 3-4%. And most users won\u2019t even bother using an alternative payment system because it\u2019s inconvenient and they won\u2019t be getting a cheaper price (Devs will be paying more for users to use alternative payments)",

Official EPA rating of 520 range. Plus with PIPE lockup expired 9/1, most of short term investors are done dumping shares. With that, and a week long PR event, very good chance they will set a date, and send the stock to URANUS! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredits for this DD, and a shoutout, goes to [u/ddroukas](https://www.reddit.com/user/ddroukas/). I am going to snag his work and put it here for all you apes to adore, and believe the hype!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;begin\\_plagiarism&gt;*\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yj8bmpuzyp71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0a6f9f941f2dbfc78063d5256fccdab29a04b84\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes C\\*\\*\\* rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - C\\*\\*\\*-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o1stpusvzyp71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7eff1951a48874c28474791856d75dea6120ba\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izejluexzyp71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba9252ec9a4efe2cb550b385fa9c38099419f025\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhio20z00zp71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd5baa49a33a130763584fdb952fc85abc95bf32\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usm8geczzyp71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fffdc7aaae1f913ab3a9400a1133ad1212c0644\n\n\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8imlj130zp71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=210716737bce8e989efa725e986cdb45e242ac1c\n\nProject Gravity SUV\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blka49d40zp71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f1fb4ca97e2736af6a8c83c96c984716f1c3e2\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7ubjif50zp71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39d87075d7ed1e05626f32fdcb85bd59550a1c4e\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/buq3dei60zp71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a2698ee2c34a0a37850630aa50d9bf43d0beb3\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*18.33\\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.81\\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*12.7\\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\\*N/A *(see below)*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*N/A\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has called on the 12 regional presidents of the Federal Reserve System to enact new rules to prevent their leaders from individual stock trading.\n\nWhat Happened: Warren, who is the chairwoman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Policy, made her request following news reports that Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren actively traded stocks and other investments during 2020.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Kaplan made multiple stock trades of more than $1 million each involving shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. -ADR (NYSE: BABA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), while Rosengren focused his trades on real estate-related securities.\n\nWarren pointed out that although Kaplan and Rosengren pledged to sell their individual stock holdings and no longer trade individual stocks, their actions created conflicts of interest and potential self-dealing.\n\n'This controversy over asset trading by high-level Fed personnel highlights why it is necessary to ban ownership and trading of individual stocks by senior officials who are supposed to serve the public interest,' Warren stated. 'Regional Fed leaders must ban the ownership and trading of individual stocks by senior officials, and impose strong and enforceable ethics and financial conflicts of interest rules for themselves and their staff to restore public trust.'\n\nRelated Link: Sen. Elizabeth Warren Asks Federal Reserve To Break Up Wells Fargo\n\nWhat Else Happened: Warren also raised attention to her proposed Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, which she said was designed to strengthen conflict of interest and recusal requirements of government officials by banning individual stock ownership by members of Congress, senior congressional staff, federal judges, members of the presidential cabinet, White House staff and other senior agency officials while they are in office.\n\nWarren's legislation also included provisions to prevent federal government officials from holding or trading stock in companies that could influence their agency, department or actions. It also requires senior government officials and White House staff to divest from privately owned assets that could present conflicts, including large companies and commercial real estate.\n\nWarren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act in 2018 without co-sponsors and was never acted upon by the Senate. She reintroduced the legislation in 2020, again without co-sponsors, and the bill was referred to the Senate Finance Committee but has yet to be brought up for consideration.\n\nPhoto: Gage Skidmore / Flickr Creative Commons.\n\n\u00a9 2021 Benzinga.com.

Exactly, it's basically zero. At some point on monday, the stock price will go at least to like 147 or sth., or if not monday, than in the next week/month or sth.\n\nSo there is zero chance of losing your money and you can cash out super fast if you buy like 1000 Stocks for 146.03 and sell them for 146.50, you just made 470 bucks, congratulations. You now repeat this with fairly stable stocks like IBM thousands of times and you are rich.

Yet shorts seem dominating the SP of the ticker and scare retailers away. There was a small short squeeze (up 30% without news) happened weeks ago but that's not the reason I create the post. I want to share all the knowledge I have about the company to discuss whether it is a good short term and long term investment. Potential short squeeze is of course a plus but that's not what I pursue here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why shorts are hunting Canoo**\n\nCanoo was founded in 2017 by executives from BMW, Tesla, Ford, etc and went public last year. The main reason shorts crowded in is the disastrous earning call in March, where the previous CEO Ulrich (along with chief lawyer Andrew) stepped away and the new CEO Tony took over the company.  The change of executives also triggered a SEC investigation on the company. Meanwhile, Canoo does not have cars in production yet and blew off the deals with Apple and Hyundai. Those negative news hence scared away retail investors and shorts come in and took over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MPDV I](https://preview.redd.it/l21zt3w92rm71.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b116f98f8210896dcbec741cd546a055cb9b44c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MPDV](https://preview.redd.it/te2jtddb2rm71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8fbc02ba2b433c99b2124f970a5e010a2d78948)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why I view the change of CEO positive**\n\nUlrich was later hired by Apple. (FYI, Apple reached Canoo in 2019 and 2020 for acquisition but Canoo turned it down. Canoo said that they don't want acquisition but investment.) Although many people view Ulrich's stepping down as a negative news, I view it differently.  The main disagreement between Ulrich and the board (including the new CEO Tony who invested $75million of his own money into the company), as I understand it,  is the business model and directions. Ulrich wants to create a subscription model for their vehicles (companies subscribe/lease vehicles) yet I don't think the Canoo board agreed. We have to admit that Ulrich contributed significantly to Canoo as Chief Technology Officer yet I don't think he can be a qualified CEO leading the company to right business model.  Tony, on the contrary, has abundant success business records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What has changed after March.**\n\nEveryone seems keeping those bad memories of Canoo after the earning call and no one really cares about what is really going on under the new leadership.  Facts below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Canoo received $300M incentives from the Oklahoma government to build their factory. FYI, Rivian (pre-IPO which is valued $80B) received $350M from the Texas government. I don't think those state governors are morons. The question is why Oklahoma governments picked Canoo instead of all other 'promising' EV companies out there. (source: [https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar))\n* Canoo received 10,000 orders from FRONTdoor Collective executives (source: [https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network))\n* Canoo has 9,500 non biding orders from individual customers.\n* Canoo has signed contract with VDL Nedcar ( that produced BMW in Europe) source ([https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)) Their first batch of car will be on market in 2022q4.\n* Canoo has been hunting for talents: the number of employees jumped from \\~200 to \\~700 and most of them are engineers. They have the ambassador Josette on board as the new president ( believe her connections can win Canoo government and international orders). (source: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canoo-names-ambassador-josette-sheeran-president-301340683.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canoo-names-ambassador-josette-sheeran-president-301340683.html))\n* Meanwhile, I think that Canoo has some news being held (The CEO mentioned in q2 earning call and there is either no news or big news), they have been actively expanding different markets (pest control, delivery. They attended different expos (ACT expo for example)  and received a lot of interests from companies like UPS for their MPDV type, they speak on Panel at World's Largest Mobility Event, etc.\n* Rumors still stir around about the Apple and Canoo thing. I think as long as the price is seductive, there are always possibilities. I see a more possible situation as that Canoo focuses on hardware while Apple contributes the softwares (autonomous driving).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Lifestyle vans](https://preview.redd.it/3u0vhilc2rm71.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d60457126baa2ab77ff155c3846f187939f3af9e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is the core technology behind Canoo**  \n Skateboard technology + versatile/flexible modules. The skateboard technology they own saves a lot of space and create more rooms for passengers.  The modulization gives the advantage of customization and reduce the production cost as well.  Their MPDVs (MPDV I, II and III with different sizes) and Lifestyles Vans are to B while the pickup truck (expected to go to market in 2023) are to C. But I personally would like to customize a MPDV for traveling as well!  \n [https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video)\n\n**TL;DR**  \n Canoo has $563.6 million in cash and $300million incentives received from the Oklahoma government. This combines into $863.6 million. The company currently valued at $1.65B (less than 2x of the cash equivalents the companies owned), which is far undervalued compared with its peers. It is like $NIO when it was at $3. Short float reported as 40% but it should be much higher than this.  This is the company that Apple reached for acquisition not a long time ago, and rumors and speculation still stirs around about the collaboration. Their design of vehicles always remind me of the feeling that I first time saw iphone 3gs.  And hopefully you guys can see me driving a Canoo Pickup or Van in the near future.  \n Position: long term holder 2900 @$8.23 (still adding though).

        "selftext": "My main point is to discuss how the potential Patent Sale would transform BlackBerry's dynamic, image and cash position. [My 1st OP on this subject.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mliwqp/blackberry_how_the_patent_sale_could_transform_bb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) ^(For future reference BB reported last night 22-Sep-21 and price is now $10.65.)\n\n**Let me start with the TLDR smooth version for crayon eaters**\n\n* BB has been negotiating a sale of a bunch of their mobile phone patents (they no longer need) for around **$1bn $1.3bn range** (my estimate). They already have $772m in the bank &amp; their market cap is $6bn. So they would have 30% as much cash as their current market price (yes it's a lot).\n* Revenue for all businesses beat expectations this quarter.\n* If and once it's confirmed the media will run the story that BB is now a company of the future fully focused on IoT (internet of things) and cybersecurity (and no longer failed phones \"lol\").\n* Their most ambitious project: building the equivalent of the Apple Store back when the iPhone came out but for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. Project name: IVY. Oh and they have a partner in this: Amazon. Early release: in a few weeks October 2021.\n* Now why it's taking so long to sell that Portfolio? Well the big boss (Papa Chen) said he's mad too and added *\"it's coming up, the next Christmas\"* (2021). *I put 80%, we get it done this quarter.*\n\n**Before I go any further: imagine you have a paper acct like me, so how to trade BB?**\n\n^(Not a recommendation to use real $$$.) Rule of thumb: when it's below $10.00 it's a paper buying signal. But why bro? Well check the graph for whichever timeframe you want in 2021. It doesn't stay for long in single digit. There is big money behind it (yea looking at you Allianz AM) so ppl BTFD.\n\nBut it's already above $10 bruv... Well either wait for a pullback and pls refer to how quick it bounced back from the dip this morning or do your own DD and risk assessment if it's still worth it below $11...\n\nDo not FOMO at $15+ or God forbids $20+. Be smart be early with your monopoly paper bills.\n\n**The in-depth details and why I call it a Christmas Gift**\n\nThe most important is: Papa Chen said 6 months ago - when they first revealed the ongoing negotiations - that \"our investors would be very pleased with it\". In the previous quarter he said it is at a stage of definitive agreement. But last night he brought that term: it's coming for Christmas. And I feel how cheeky he is. It's both a time frame and a gift to BB ^(bag)holders. \n\nNow I must emphasise it's not 100% done. The sale could still fail. He put a probability of 80% that it would be done by Xmas. So now I must share Papa Chen's exact words:\n\n*Turning now to licensing. As I mentioned earlier, negotiation to sell the portion of the patent portfolio related to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking, are ongoing. And we have made significant progress since our last earnings call, including preliminary agreement of many of the key terms of the deal. We expect to execute definitive agreement this quarter. Closing the transaction will be subject to a normal regulatory review. Naturally, given this backdrop, we will continue to eliminate monetization activities for the remaining of the fiscal year, therefore, revenue for both Q3 and Q4 is expected to be similar to Q2, which is at $10 million per quarter. While we expect the sales to conclude essentially, the process has taken longer than we expected or anticipated. Should it not conclude this quarter, we have other options, including additional interested parties. We will update investors on any of the material developments in a timely manners.*\n\nThen later in the Q&amp;A:\n\nPaul Treiber -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\n*Hi, John. First question on the patent sale, I know you can't say much just given you're in the middle of negotiations. But in your statement, you mentioned that the negotiations are going well. But then you also indicated that if it doesn't close, you have other options. Just could you bridge between those two statements, because they're actually quite far apart from a tone perspective.*\n\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman &amp; CEO\n\n*That's a good one. I'm glad you caught it. Yes, it is going well. I fully expect to finish this this quarter.* ***But I'm tired of waiting. I know a lot of our investors are too.*** *I'm not blaming anything on anybody, and may be we have too many lawyers assigned to this, sorry, lawyers, I doubted you. But the key is: it's a complex and big portfolio. It is rightfully so that they have done a lot of due diligence, and those things are now completed by the way, all the due diligence are completed. And then we have a lot of time span on definitive agreement negotiation. And then by and large, with the exception of one or two items, we're done with that. And then we have the purchase agreement. And so it just for me, it's been since last Christmas. It's coming up, the next Christmas. So, I basically kind of draw the line in the sand and say, I can just stop licensing the business so either move on one direction or the other. And then there are other interested parties in calling. And so we are not entertaining them because, as you recall during a period of time, not long in the past, we were in exclusive discussion with these people. So I can't really entertain a third-party. So my only point is, if you want to put percentage, waiting percentage, I put 80%, 20%. I put 80%, we get it done this quarter. Does that help?*\n\nPaul Treiber -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\n*Yeah, that's very helpful. I wasn't going to ask for percentage, but I'm glad you threw it out.*\n\nLater in the Q&amp;A Chen added: *I would say to you that that we have settled on the price.*\n\n**Thoughts and Risks**\n\nTo be honest some of the risks are behind: it should have been sold already. Instead these negotiations have been dragged over the last 6 months hurting BB both top and bottom line. Making them miss their numbers. Downgraded by mean analysts. Reduced to a meme name.\n\nBut Papa Chen had enough of this BS. He and I quote has drawn a line in the sand. Either they send the money or he's gonna talk to other companies. I'm not sure how threatening does this sound...\n\nBottomline: if the sale is not concluded to this particular buyer from North America it would have been a lot of time and money wasted.\n\nThen comes the regulatory risk because the sale could be delayed or even blocked for antitrust concerns or what not.\n\nBut if we are in the 80% area and the sale is indeed concluded by Xmas that would significantly strengthen BB financials and business model as they would be then fully focused on IoT and cyber.\n\nBlackBerry needs to tell this story to the world: forget about the past, forget about our phones (even though they were so cool with the keyboard), we are now primed to be a New Big Tech company. For where you are now. And where you go next.\n\n^(Positions or ban: paper long shares at 9ish and long BB FDs, next weeklies and monthlies.)",

        "selftext": "Coke is just soda.\n\nLevi\u2019s are just jeans.\n\nThe iPhone is just a phone.\n\nYet, we go out of our ways to select certain brands over others - most of the time at a higher price \\[1\\]. Everyone knows the importance of reputation for a company. Highly reputable brands have multiple things going for them:\n\n* Their customers are extremely loyal and drive recurring purchases\n* The public is vocal about recommending their brand and products\n* Easier to expand to other markets as their reputation precedes them\n\nBasically, you can consider having a great reputation to be a positive feedback loop on steroids! In an economy where 70-80% of the market value of a company comes from intangible assets like brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill \\[2\\], reputations can make or break a company\u2019s performance.\n\nIn one of my previous analyses, we had discovered and proved that the [best companies to work for routinely beat the market in stock returns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/). So this week, let\u2019s see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!\n___\n**Data**\n\nWhile there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https://www.reptrak.com/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.\n\nThey base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.\n\nI am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \\[2012 - 2021\\] \n___\n**Analysis**\n\nRepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.\n\nEven though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \\[3\\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \\[4\\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years &amp; till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \\[5\\]\n___\n **Results** \n\n**Return Comparison - SPY vs Top 10 - Most Reputable Brands** \n\n|Time Period|Most Reputable Brand (Avg Return)|SPY (Avg Return)|Alpha|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1 Year|17.1%|16.2%|0.9%|\n|3 Years|44.8%|41.2%|3.6%|\n|5 Years|94.1%|77.9%|16.2%|\n|Till Date|188.3%|136.4%|51.9%|\n\n \n\nCompanies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.\n\nMy hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.\n\n[Another interesting insight](https://preview.redd.it/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796) we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year\u2019s list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7/10 years \\[6\\]. \n___\n**Limitations to the Analysis**\n\nThere are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.\n\n* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year\u2019s worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.\n* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \\[7\\]\n* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return &amp; Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through). \n___\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives. Just think about the number of times you/your friend have sworn by a brand and recommended it to everyone \\[8\\]. Almost all the brands in the top 10 list (eg. Rolex, Ferrari, Adidas, Harley-Davidson) have users that are extremely loyal, willing to pay a premium, and acts as unofficial spokespersons for the company.\n\nOur analysis, in turn, proves that all these positive factors cause the company to outperform the market!

Kaplan\u2019s early retirement follows an announcement earlier in the day from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who said he will leave as well but cited health concerns and not the issue over his investment portfolio activity. \u201cThe Federal Reserve is approaching a critical point in our economic recovery as it deliberates the future path of monetary policy. Unfortunately, the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction to the Federal Reserve\u2019s execution of that vital work,\u201d Kaplan said in a statement.\n\nHis retirement takes effect Oct. 8. The resignations come a day before Fed Chair Jerome Powell is to spend two days on Capitol Hill updating legislators on the Fed\u2019s efforts to combat the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Controversy had swirled over the issue following disclosures that Kaplan in particular had been executing large-dollar trades in big-name companies such as Amazon, Apple and Delta Airlines. The Wall Street Journal first reported the trades. Subsequent to the disclosures, both Kaplan and Rosengren said they would be selling their stocks to avoid the appearance of conflict. Questions were raised because the Fed has conducted trillions of dollars in asset purchases aimed at helping markets function, and has bought corporate bonds from mega-cap companies including Apple.\n\nKaplan insisted he had done nothing wrong. \u201cDuring my tenure, I have adhered to all Federal Reserve ethical standards and policies,\u201d he said in his monthly statement. \u201cMy securities investing activities and disclosures met Bank compliance rules and standards.\u201d Still, the issue has reverberated through the Fed, with officials pledging to tighten rules so that such potential conflicts don\u2019t happen again. \u201cWe need to make changes, and we\u2019re going to do that as a consequence of this,\u201d Powell said last week. \u201cThis will be a thorough going and comprehensive review. We\u2019re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards.\u201d Powell vowed that changes would be made. \u201cI want to be able to look back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this challenge and handled the situation well and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public\u2019s interest and the institution that we\u2019re all a part of,\u201d he said. Powell on Monday wished Kaplan well and praised his work at the Dallas Fed. \u201cHe has been a passionate and forceful public voice on a wide range of issues, including the critical value of early childhood education and literacy,\u201d the chairman said in a statement. Meredith Black, the first vice president at the Dallas Fed who herself was planning on retiring, will serve as interim head for the district until a permanent successor is chosen.",

        "selftext": "So, Alibaba is of course the most discussed stock in the last month on this sub, I think. So I decided to discuss Tencent, instead.\n\nI think Tencent is simply incredible. Let's see why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **WeChat** \n\nThey own WeChat/Weixin (Weixin is for mainland China, WeChat for everywhere else. I will call it WeChat). WeChat is.. WeChat. Mohnish pabrai calls it \"a bazooka Tencent can fire at will\". It has 1.25 billion users. What can you do on WeChat? Everything. Text, pay for stuff, play games, shop online, anything. Imagine if the following app existed:\n\n* Need something on Amazon? No problem, you can do it directly from WeChat through its mini-app.\n* Need to pay something in a shop? Use TenPay.\n* Need a ride on Uber? Use WeChat mini-app.\n* Need to order food on DoorDash? WeChat.\n\nReplace Amazon with JD, Uber with Didi, DoorDash with Meituan, and you have WeChat. \n\nWeChat is a bazooka beause, if Tencent decides to partner with someone and allows them to integrate in their ecosystem, that business will explode. It happened with Pinduoduo, which mainly works on WeChat: it grew 100% last year.\n\nSince it runs the platform, Tencent gets a commission. Also, it stores all the data that goes through these apps. In 2020, revenue from WeChat was 16.7 billion dollars, out of 74.6 billion in total. WeChat has 3.2 million mini programs on its platform, which transacted 1.6 trillion RMB (247 billion $) in 2020. To get how much this thing is growing, in 2017 it was 210 billion RMB (32b).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's empire**\n\nTencent has an impressive number of businesses: they have a subscription revenue which is 62% that of Netflix; a media ads business (bigger than the Nyt), games, cloud, mobile payment services. Their business is so wide it is hard to navigate. Some examples:\n\n1. **Gaming**: Tencent has around 50% of market share in China in the mobile gaming industry. In 2020 they made 29.3 billions from games. In 2021 it is probably going to be lower. Online gaming industry in 2020 was 58b, it is expected to grow to 86b in 2027. Mobile gaming is projected to be 70% of the online gaming market in China by then.\n2. **TenPay**: There are two ways to pay for stuff in China: TenPay and AliPay. While in the West switched from cash to cards, and are still in transition, China has skipped a step and went directly to mobile payments. In 2018 already, a walloping 83% of all payments in China were made through mobile. Now it is around 90%. Cards are useless, in China: they account for less than 5% of payments. In the Western world, Google pay and Apple Pay are only now eroding the empire of Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc. China, on the other hand, was to Tencent and Alibaba like a smooth field: they just took over. Apple pay now has around 500 million users world-wide. Tencent has 900 millions. From the last financial report, Tencent shows that revenue of the financial technology and corporate services business increased by 40% year-on-year to RMB 41.9 billion (6. billions). China's mobile payment market is projected to reach 88.4 Billion usd by the year 2027, trailing a CAGR of 47.3%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's fantastic portfolio**:\n\nBefore you do a cf analysis of Tencent, you need to know that Tencent has a portfolio that is currently valued around 250 billions usd at present. It is like a financial version of Cthulhu, with tentacles everywhere. It is quite hard to navigate/find information about it. They say they are currently invested in over 700 companies, of which only 103 are publicly traded. This guy has put up a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1owpL6WmMK30X19Kw3BziAw39rGJbsfIMOOexdtvAkxU/edit) for you that tracks the most notable public ones.\n\nSome notable busineness Tencent owns (percentages might not be accurate):\n\na) Gaming:\n\n* 100% Riot Games (League of Legends)\n* 40% Epic Games (Fortnite)\n* 81.4% Supercell (Clash of Clans)\n* 10% BlueHole (PUBG)\n* 80% Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile)\n* 5% Activision Blizzard.\n* 20% Kingsoft (gaming competitor in China &amp; cloud business)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) Finance:\n\n* 30% Webank (biggest online bank in China)\n* 2%? Khatabook (digital payments in India)\n* 25% Gojek (same in Indonesia)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc) Social:\n\n* 50.1% Huya (twitch-like)\n* 38% Douyu (twitch-like)\n* 12% Snapchat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd) Music:\n\n* 58% Tencent music\n* 6.8% Spotify\n* 10% Universal music group\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ne) E-commerce:\n\n* 25% Sea ltd (which also makes games, does mobile payments etc)\n* 18% JD\n* 17% Pinduodo\n* 7% Vipshop\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nf) Other\n\n* 20% Meituan (Doordash of China)\n* 15% Nio (ev)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Valuation**\n\nHow do you value Tencent? Currently, Tencent has a market cap of 619.72b, with a P/E of 24 and P/fcf (trailing 12 months) of 22 (Do not forget the investment portfolio, as well). fcf grew 29.4% a year in the last 10 years. Tencent has Microsoft-style profit margins of 35%. Revenue is growing at more than 30% a year, which is insane for a company this size. With its impressive portfolio, Tencent is poised to have a leading role in a country that is growing it GDP at 7%, that soon will catch up with the US, and where around 500 million people are projected to reach middle class in the next 10 years, something which will benefit tech companies the most. Of course, the risks are China regulations, in particular its anti-monopoly campaign; China in general: VIE structure, accounting standards etc. Here is an earnings based model, but take it with a grain of salt. \n\nDiscount rate: 14%. Based on eps without nri. 20 years.\n\n* Best scenario (20%): year 1-10: 25% growth, y 10-20: 10%. Value: 112.13\n* Normal scenario (60%): y1-10: 18%; y10-20: 10%. Value: 70.38\n* Worst scenario (20%): y1-10: 15%. y10-20: 8%. Value: 55.27\n* Fair value: 75.7\n* current price: 64.56. Undervalued by 17.25 % for a 14% return.  \n\n\nOf course it's all about assumptions. If you raise margin of safety, cut down growth estimates etc, you will get a very different number. I think I used a fairly conservative growth estimate, though. I personally think the upside for Tencent is insane., even though it is a behemoth already. It is one of my strongest buys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might consider doing a separate post about the risks of investing in Tencent: China regulations etc. For now.. thanks for reading!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/)\n\n[https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider](https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com) &amp; [gurufocus.com/](https://gurufocus.com/)\n\n[https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/](https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/)\n\n[https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/](https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/)\n\n[https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf](https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf)\n\n[https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html](https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html)\n\n[https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020](https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020)",

        "selftext": "I was asked by my pops when the correction was going to end, and it made me think that it was a good topic to have a discussion on with my favorite retards.\n\nHere is my response\n\n\u201cWell, seeing as how everyone is over leveraged including hedge funds, it could pull back 10%. Right now it's at 5, and everyone swore it wouldn't get to 5 lol. \n\nThe 50 EMA, which is the uptrending channel it's been on for the past year and a half, convincingly broke the past two trading sessions. It is now focused on the 100EMA, if it breaks that, youre looking at a fall to about 390/395 for the SPY, and 3800 for the SPX. (Spitballing here for you gay technical gurus)\n\nTo be honest though, I'm not buying that it will be a crash or a major correction past 7%. I believe it falls tomorrow and Wednesday, which allows me to make profit lol, and then soars Friday. There is no way the federal reserve 1) stops buying bonds at the rate they are doing, or 2) hike interest rates while delta variant is growing in the US.\n\nAlthough the economy is showing good growth, and inflation is running rampid (not transitory like  they try to say), the fed will continue to print infinite money therefore ruining the economy and setting up another great financial crisis event. The crash will severely destruct the country. \n\n1. The debt ceiling raise is being opposed by the republicans , without that raise, America essentially defaults on debt, which makes the evergrande (you need to google that, that's important) situation look like a walk in the park. They are probably doing this to delay the infrastructure bill (which will \"help\" the economy by pumping even more money into it, therefore causing a crash)......excuse my language but basically either way we are in a shit ton of trouble . \n\n2. In terms of the bill, it's coinciding with a tax rate for every class, let's start from the bottom up, there is a 11 million dollars getting pumped into the stock market every day by retail investors, this is largely from shutdowns, stimulus checks, and no incentive to put money in savings (see: interest rates) this slows down when the public opens up unrestricted, and when taxes are hiked to pay for the bill. Now, here is the trick that is lost on a lot of people. The administration doesn't want to hike taxes for anyone under 400000, but what they are missing is taxes are being put on popular items that people under the 400000 limit typically spend their money on (see: tobacco), moving on from that, those with incomes ranging 400000 to 5 million will be taxed at 28%, this is the somewhat important money, not as much as corporations but has the ability to drive prices unlike retailers. A lot of loopholes like the mega roth back door and criptoe (see: mods \ud83d\ude44)  being treated as a property rather than a security would be reversed. That has big implications into the next part. Corporations. The administration hopes to raise the tax rate on capital gains to 39%. The one thing the rich know how to do, is get around the system that was built for them to succeed. What this will do is force a further sell off by the big money in order to escape the new tax rate, and buy at a cheaper price in order to capitalize/make up for the tax rate during the economic recovery. The corporations will make off with more money than they had before, in a resurgent economy that is powered by the money of the only losing party who started the year and half rally in the first place, the retailers. \n\n3. I don't know if you remember, but I spoke to you all in the group chat about the federal reserve and their bond buying program, I was betting on that it stopped, but it didn't and reversed to its last ATH. The fed stated that the economy was not ready to go in its own and decided that tapering was off the table, the stock market rallied from its 2.5% low to an ATH in 3 hours. 10 days. 10 days later it created its last ATH (all time high) and has fallen for the past 3 weeks. Which is a clear sign that it is over valued. &amp; furthermore, several fed board members have sold exactly at that ATH (which is illegal), Congress and pelosi has as well (which is illegal) and the only people who think the stock market will reverse back to ATH are, the retailers. The fed has two options, continue printing infinite amounts of money to stabilize a already stable economy further losing up the bubble to Great Depression proportions (which would not serve their best interest since they all have capitalized and SOLD already \ud83d\ude2c) or taper the economy and have the equivalent of the great financial crisis sell off for the next month . Technicals or news doesn't move the markets, people do. \n\n\nI'm hoping for a 10% correction, which is healthy for the economy and also for my bank account, I've already made my profit thus far, but if it doesn't continue correction and reverses to all time highs, we are going to enter a year long recession. There just isn't anymore money to throw at the economy without it coming back. \n\nAnd technically, the S&amp;P/Nasdaq are tech heavy and controlled by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, google), if there is a sector rotation there isn't one single sector that can hold a candle to them. The economy will falter.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not the smartest in the world on any of these subjects. I suspect neither of you guys are either. Jokes are welcomed. And I\u2019m also willing to learn on shit I was probably wrong on in here. CAN YOUUUU DIGGGG ITTTTT?! \n\nLET THE GAMES BEGIN!\n\nTL;DR - What do you think about the correction, recovery, and future of the stock market?",

        "selftext": "**TL:DR** This post progresses in a way that outlines my logic and leads up to my theory that IONQ may not shit the bed post-merger and rather, could do quite well. However, I am just an \ud83e\udd8d and none of this is financial advice. All feedback is much appreciated.\n\n===============================================================================\n\nAs most on this sub know, PIPE investors are usually not bound by lockup provisions. There are exceptions (e.g. LCID) but they are the exception rather than the norm. In this post I\u2019d like to go through some observations relating to the DMYI/IonQ deal, which also involves a (partially) locked-up PIPE.\n\nTo be clear, I know zilch about quantum computing. You can read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/odncga/ionq_dmyi_the_leader_in_quantum_computing_15/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/odnfyt/ionq_dmyi_the_leader_in_quantum_computing_15/) brilliant DD if you\u2019d like to get into the technical details. This post is less about IonQ's business specifically than it is about its unique setup due to the existence of its PIPE lockups.\n\nThe implications of such PIPE lockups include:\n\n**1. They signal some commitment, or at least some long-term orientation, towards the de-SPAC target.**\n\n* This could reduce the chances of large PIPE dumps / huge selling pressure when PIPE is able to sell.\n* Furthermore, some of the subscription agreements contain very interesting clauses that reduce or altogether cancel the lockup periods if certain share price targets are met, in some cases if the shares exceed $40 and $65. This is very odd - are they expecting IONQ to actually pump to that price? Hmm..\n\n**2. A delayed PIPE unlock implies that the post-merger float is not ambushed by millions of shares hitting the market, at least for some time.**\n\n* If redemptions to DMYI are aplenty, this could make for some spicy stuff.\n\nI am much more interested in implication 1), because this could mean that despite being a very speculative play, IONQ might not get destroyed post merger due to the presence of the strategic long term PIPE investors, many of whom are bound by lockups.\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# The Overview\n\nSo let\u2019s begin with some excerpts from DMYI\u2019s [latest S-4/A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521242312/d70340ds4a.htm). From P.102:\n\n&gt;From January 14, 2021 through March 5, 2021, dMY\u2019s advisors engaged in calls and correspondence with potential strategic investors in the PIPE Investment and their respective counsel. During this period, dMY and IonQ discussed the terms of such strategic investors\u2019 investment in the PIPE Investment and negotiated the terms of the subscription agreements of such investors. The terms of such strategic investors\u2019 subscription agreements were finalized on March 5, 2021. **A principal issue for the subscription agreements for strategic investors was the inclusion of lock-up provisions**.\n\nOdd, because PIPE usually has no lockup. Then from P.135:\n\n&gt;On March 7, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, dMY entered into the Subscription Agreements with the PIPE Investors, pursuant to, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, the PIPE Investors have collectively subscribed for 35,000,000 shares of Class A Stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to $350.0 million.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Strategic Investors have agreed to be bound by lock-up provisions with respect to their subscribed shares. The lock-up periods for Strategic Investors vary between 6 and 18 months,** subject to certain conditions, depending on the number of shares of Class A Stock subscribed for by each Strategic Investor and a number of other factors\\*\\*. **Venture capital and other investors have agreed to be bound by lock-up provisions with respect to their subscribed shares for a period of six months**,\\*\\* subject to the terms of their subscription agreements or, in the case of certain investors that were previously investors in dMY, the Lock-Up Agreement.\n\nSo there's a **$350M PIPE with lockups**, but the reality is actually more nuanced. There are seven separate subscription agreements in the exhibits to the S-4/A (exhibits 10.9-10.15). Six of them have a section entitled \u201cTransfer Restrictions\u201d which specify lockup provisions, while one does not. Let\u2019s go through the subscription agreements to iron out the important details.\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# Review of Subscription Agreements\n\nI\u2019ll start with the easiest ones:\n\n1. **Exhibit 10.12,** [**MSD Subscription Agreement**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex104.htm)\n\n* **Who are they?** MSD Capital is \u201ca private investment firm that manages the capital of Michael Saul Dell (yes, that Michael Dell) and his family\u201d\n* **No. of Shares:** 4M (implied from below)\n\n&gt;Section 3l) states:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Subscription Agreement, the Company is entering into the Other Subscription Agreements providing for the sale of 31,000,000 Other Subscribed Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $310,000,000\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The PIPE size is 35M shares, implying MSD is buying 4M shares.\n\n* **Lockup Provisions (from Section 9)**\n   * **Lockup period is 6 months post closing** unless:\n      * If, between the closing date and 3 months post closing, IONQ\u2019s share price is \u2265 $40 for any 20 trading days within any 30 day trading period (hereafter abbreviated to \u201c20/30\u201d), **the lockup period is reduced to 3 months.**\n      * If, between the closing date and 3 months post closing, IONQ\u2019s share price is \u2265 $65 for any 20/30 days, **the lockup period is immediately terminated.**\n      * If, between 3 months post closing and 6 months post closing, IONQ\u2019s share price is  \u2265 $40 for any 20/30 days, **the lockup period is immediately terminated.**\n   * Hmm, this is odd, isn\u2019t it? Why go through the trouble to include these clauses with astronomical share prices? Does that mean the sponsor/subscriber thinks IONQ stock can actually achieve those targets? You decide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Exhibit 10.14,** [**BEV Subscription Agreement**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex106.htm)**.**\n\n* This is very similar to MSD\u2019s subscription agreement. Relevant details are:\n* **Who are they?** \u201cBreakthrough Energy Ventures is the clean-tech venture capital fund led by Bill Gates\u201d\n* **No. of shares (implied from section 3l):** 2.5M shares\n* **Lockup Provisions:** Same as MSD. The $40 and $65 clauses are there as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Exhibit 10.13,** [**Silver Lake**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex105.htm)**:**\n\n* **Who are they?** A \u201cglobal private equity firm focused on investments in technology, technology-enabled and related industries.\u201d\n* **No. of shares (implied from section 3m):** 6M shares.\n* **Lockup Provisions:**\n   * 1/3 of shares: NO lockup;\n   * 1/3 of shares: Lockup period is 18 months;\n   * 1/3 of shares: Lockup period ends on the earlier of (1) 12 months and (2) the date at which IONQ\u2019s share price is \u2265 $12 for any 20/30 days commencing 150 days post closing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Hyundai and Kia:\n\n**4. Exhibit 10.10,** [**Hyundai:**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex102.htm)\n\n* **No. of shares:** Couldn\u2019t find this info.\n* **Lockup Provisions:** 6 months post closing.\n\n**5. Exhibit 10.11,** [**Kia**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex103.htm)**:**\n\n* **No. of shares:** Couldn\u2019t find this info.\n* **Lockup Provisions:** 6 months post closing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe remaining two subscription agreements are more general in nature, tailored towards a more differentiated group of investors:\n\n**6. Exhibit 10.15,** [**VC Investors/Other Investors:**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex107.htm)\n\n* **Who are they?** Not specifically listed, but according to the IONQ investor deck and Google news on past fundraising rounds, some of these backers include Google Ventures, HP, Airbus, Samsung, Acme\u2026\n* **No. of shares:** Not listed.\n* **Lockup Provisions:** 6 months post closing.\n\n**7. Exhibit 10.9,** [**\u201cFinancial Investors\":**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521072373/d142872dex101.htm)\n\n* This is the most general and yet the most obscure. What are financial investors?\n* **No. of shares:** Not listed.\n* **Lockup Provisions:** This agreement lacks a section on Transfer Restrictions, unlike all of the other agreements listed above. **THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO LOCKUPS FOR THIS GROUP OF PIPE INVESTORS.** This would also make sense if \u201cfinancial investors\u201d represents your \u201cfast money hedge funds.\u201d\n* Furthermore, in the [March 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521072373/d142872d8k.htm) it is mentioned that:\n\n&gt;Subscription Agreements entered into by and among the Company and each of Hyundai Motor Company (\u201cHyundai\u201d), KIA Motors Corporation (\u201cKia\u201d), MSD Partners, L.P. (\u201cMSD\u201d), Silver Lake Partners VI DE (AIV), L.P. (\u201cSilver Lake\u201d) and Breakthrough Energy Ventures II, L.P. (**\u201cBEV,\u201d and together with Hyundai, Kia, MSD and Silver Lake, the \u201cStrategic Investors\u201d**), are filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6, respectively...\n\nThey also then say \"The **Strategic Investors** have agreed to be bound by lock-up provisions with respect to their subscribed shares\", referring to the aforementioned group. However, the \"financial investors\" are not specifically included as part of the \"strategic investors,' suggesting that they are NOT bound by these lock-ups.\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# So What?\n\n**Conclusions:** From the above, assuming IONQ does not pump beyond $12 (or $40, or $65 lol), it follows that:\n\n* 4M+2.5M (MSD+BEV) = 6.5M shares are locked up for 6 months\n* A bunch more shares (Kia+Hyundai+VC\u2019s+Other Investors) are locked up for 6 months\n   * Unfortunately I am unable to estimate how many shares this group owns\n* 2M (\u2153 Silver Lake) shares are locked up for at least 12 months\n* 2M (\u2153 Silver Lake) shares are locked up for 18 months\n* At the very minimum, **that's 10.5M of the 35M PIPE shares locked up for at least 6 months**\n\n**Theory:** **Due to significant lockups and the presence of strategic/long-term investors, it is possible that IONQ does not dump bigly post merger and instead ends up doing quite well. But don\u2019t take it from me; take it from the sponsor:**\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# Sponsor Commentary (aka Sponsor Pumping)\n\nDMYI\u2019s CEO, a dude by the name of Niccolo De Masi, was recently interviewed on several outlets and made some comments on the SPAC deal, the PIPE, etc. To be fair, I think the guy has a pumper\u2019s aura and his comments should be taken with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, here is some of what he said, so you can evaluate his comments yourself:\n\nFrom [IPO Edge Fireside Event](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521273799/d214884d425.htm) (September 14 2021):\n\n&gt;\u201cExciting days ahead as the world\u2019s first listed quantum computing pure play with obviously plenty of capital behind them now. **The pipe is $350 million.** T**hey only need half of that, I think, to be a profitable operating business**, so there\u2019s plenty of room for acquisitions and organic consolidation. I think this is going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the corner community space permanently.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe only thing I\u2019d point out that I think some of you have asked in the chat that I\u2019ve seen is lockups. A**nd yeah, look, most pipes in the market have no lockup, but because Peter and Niccolo** *(P.S. from yours truly: did this guy just refer to himself in 3rd person?)* **thought about this in advance and shareholders that are also useful strategic partners and customers, the lockups actually are quite extensive.** **So some of them can go out to 18 months, but there\u2019s a minimum of sort of six months from pipe investors.** **So the stock\u2019s going to trade exceptionally well, I think, and** **there\u2019s not going to be a pressure from pipe shareholders trying to recycle capital**\\*\\*.\\*\\* And that\u2019s a reason for everybody in this call to be excited, who\u2019s an investor.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is actually kind of one of the most world strangest SPACS. And then let me explain that. We went out and got anchor investors into the pipe and actually had all the money raised before we actually started the pipe investors from strategic investors. People like Breakthrough Energy and Bill Gates and Michael Dell and those kinds of people. **So we\u2019re an unusual SPAC in that we\u2019re not filled, on our pipe side, with a bunch of hedge funds. We did not fit. Those are not who are invested in this company**\\*\\*. We really wanted to go for people who had this long term vision for the company. And that\u2019s largely who are our investors are in both the dMY side and also on the IonQ pipe side.\\*\\*\n\nFrom [ICR Event Series](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521217476/d196587d425.htm) (July 15, 2021)\n\n&gt;Yeah. So, I mean, look, we\u2019ve raised the largest pipe, actually, that dMY has on any of our four transactions, **and it was the most heavily oversubscribed,** believe it or not. I think the reason for that is there\u2019s **huge strategic interest in the company**. I mean, you saw us announce a $350 million PIPE with people like Dell and Mubadala, and Sovereign wealth funds are interested. Companies are interested. Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures interested, obviously. Silver Lake\u2019s in there. Everything Peter has been talking about, I think is well diligenced and well understood not just by the Google, Amazon, Microsoft trio, who are cloud partners, but everybody that\u2019s the strategic part of the pipe. You can assume that there are many other conversations, people who wanted to be in the pipe. SoftBank came in afterwards, obviously, and there was a partnership there.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And I think it\u2019s safe to say that our **pipe investors are very bullish that this is a business that hopefully will look something like an Nvidia 10 years from today** and maybe an RM along the way. It will have tremendous value to every area of applied science.\n\nAnd this is where he turned me off because he sounds like a Stocktwits Paid Pumper:\n\n&gt;And the reality is, our goal here with the $650 million of capital they\u2019ll have post-transaction close is obviously to **be the next Nvidia, to be the next Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, etc.** And I do think that if you look at the tech landscape, what engineering advantage do you have to be the next $100 billion, maybe even trillion dollar market cap company in the coming decades. It\u2019s something as big as quantum computing. A lot of other people get picked off along the way, and I\u2019m sure it will get offers along the way because we\u2019re still very, very affordable every step of the way. B**ut I really do think that this has the makings of not just being a 100 bagger from the $10 pipe investment position, but this is hopefully a 1,000 bagger, 10,000 bagger in the coming decade or two.**\n\nAs you can see, although Niccolo makes grandiose statements in the spirit of your average Stocktwits citizen, he has also presented some cases suggesting that this stock will be just fine after the merger.\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# BONUS 1: This sub ain't the only one buying warrants\n\nFrom the S-4/A, [Exhibit 10.33](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521217582/d70340dex1033.htm) shows that Amazon has warrants to purchase IONQ equity. I tried reading this agreement but my \ud83e\udd8d brain didn\u2019t get very far before quitting. Someone smarter, like apan-man will be in a much better position to explain this. I\u2019m just bringing to light the fact that this exists, and it seems like it\u2019s under the radar.\n\n# BONUS 2: Follow the warrants?\n\nFor DMYI, DMY (the sponsor) bought 4M warrants in a private placement worth $8M. Thus they paid $2 per warrant.\n\n* For DMYQ (Planet), the sponsor bought private warrants at only $1.50 apiece\n* For GENI, the sponsor also paid only $1.50 per private warrant\n* For RSI, the sponsor paid only $1 per private warrant\n* So why did they pay $2 this time around and use DMYI to acquire IONQ?Is it a coincidence? Is it a show of confidence on their part?\n* If you look at the DMYI warrants chart, you will notice that they have held up fairly well, hovering above $2 most of the time\n* They are (at the time of this writing) \\~$3, which is possibly indicative of strong performance of the shares post de-SPAC\n\n# BONUS 3: Let's go get a bigger PIPE\n\nAnother interesting thing I found is that the PIPE was apparently upsized twice. From the [December 2020 IONQ](https://www.dmytechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IonQDeck-6.44-print.pdf) deck which is somehow on DMY's website (although not posted directly \ud83d\ude09), the deal was structured as follows:\n\nThen in the [February 2021 deck](https://www.dmytechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IonQ-Management-Presentation.pdf), the PIPE was increased by $100M:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5kc5rhzh2p71.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13f02eafced051cdfb8d3b5b82828b12ed22c90a\n\nAnd in the [final investor deck](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e33152a051d2e7588f7571c/t/60459578b8c075444a656357/1615173012167/IonQ+Investor+Presentation+030721+vFF.pdf), the PIPE was increased by another $100M:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1083izk0i2p71.png?width=1227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54b180230c17de4e894df12a6ae5ac937e1d3a0d\n\nThis seems to corroborate Niccolo's comments that this company was in high demand.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8pcuen1i2p71.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87658e471a8f23efb62d8c914497f85894b8086e\n\n===============================================================================\n\n# Disclosures:\n\n* I am long 5000 DMYI shares and 1 DMYI/W\n* ***This is NOT financial advice.

chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "A recurring theme over the past year has been one \u2018expert\u2019 after another bashing index funds calling them a massive bubble that is waiting to pop. \u00a0 \n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/z8f8yutkpvl71.gif)\n\n&gt;Could Index Funds Be \u2018Worse Than Marxism\u2019? \u2013 [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This \\[index funds\\] is very much like the bubble in synthetic asset-backed CDOs before the Great Financial Crisis. It will be the Greatest Speculative Bubble of All Time in All Things \u2013 [Michael Burry](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/04/the-big-shorts-michael-burry-says-he-has-found-the-next-market-bubble.html)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Is Passive Investment Actively Hurting the Economy? - [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/is-passive-investment-actively-hurting-the-economy)\n\nBut at the same time, we have investors like Warren Buffet who still swear by a low-cost index fund and recommends it over his own Berkshire Hathaway stock! So, in this week\u2019s issue, we analyze both sides of the argument and see if we \\[1\\] should be worried about the index fund bubble!\n\n**The Problem**\n\nThe argument against the index fund is a logical one. The basic premise is that index funds affect the price discovery of stocks in the market. If a stock is bid up just based on the presence in an index and not by analyzing the underlying asset, then it can lead to a bubble-like scenario where you are buying more and more just because the asset prices are going up.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a04wyrgmpvl71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1693f22d16deb337345e5accb8f360de959707a7)\n\nIf you look at the above chart, you could see that in the first 4 months of 2021, a fund inflow of more than $20 Billion occurred just to the Vanguard 500 index fund. There are arguments stating that in the US, index funds make up [more than 50% of the fund market.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/) (This exponential growth is not a surprising one given my last analysis showed that passive funds have summarily beaten active funds over the last 2 decades)\n\nIf you think about this, more than half of the money that is flowing into the market is now just buying stocks that are on an index without doing any underlying stock analysis. The problem becomes that companies get more and more investment just because they are big and not because of their future growth prospects. So the question becomes\n\n**Is the index fund affecting the integrity of the stock market?**\n\nThe problem with the fund inflow statistics is that stock price is not decided solely based on fund inflow but majorly by trading.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cjlyt4unpvl71.png?width=629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67be6be3b3604712dd017a823da8aee69116019e)\n\nIf you look at this [study done by Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGBEL.pdf) \\[2,3\\], it destroys the price discovery argument. It shows that only 5% of the overall trading volume is captured by index funds. The rest of 95% of trading is made by active traders, pension funds, and institutional investors who do individual stock analyses.\n\nAdding to this, even if the index funds become large enough to create significant price distortions, it\u2019s something that the active fund managers can benefit from as it would give them more opportunities to short overvalued companies and create outsized returns. The fact that it\u2019s not happening right now shows that we are not anywhere near a situation where the index fund is big enough to fundamentally alter the market\\[4\\].\n\nNow that we know that index funds are not causing any price distortions, one has to wonder\n\n**why there is a sudden rise in concerns regarding an index fund bubble over the past 2-3 years?**\n\nI believe that this issue is being brought up by institutions and active fund managers as there is a drastic shift from active to passive management over the last few years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pq1b3fbppvl71.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=699fc8dd9d5f2dee76f47e6f02763c8b352084b6)\n\nThe above chart from Morningstar showcases that active funds on average lost more than $150B every year over the 2014-18 period and this trend is only becoming worse for the active funds. This trend is also replicated worldwide with more than $300B is pulled out of active funds and $500B is pushed into index funds every year (as of 2016).\n\nFinally, as of 2019, for the first time, more money is being pushed into passive than active funds! All of this must be ringing alarm bells across active funds as their income is directly dependent on the total asset under management.\n\n**Alternatives to index funds**\n\nWhile researching this topic, I came across some genuine concerns about index funds. The most important of them being that you might not be as diversified as you expect investing in an index fund.\n\nAs of Aug 2021, the top 5 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN &amp; FB) account for more than 23% of the S&amp;P500! While this worked out great for the overall index over that last decade given the tech rally, any long-term downturn for tech stocks will significantly affect your portfolio.\n\nThere are two alternatives that I found to the regular market cap based index fund allocation\n\n[Equal-weighted index funds](https://www.lynalden.com/equal-weighted-index-funds/): Equal-weighted index fund allocates your capital equally across the stocks in the given index. For Eg. in S&amp;P500 index, all the 500 companies would get an equal proportion of your index. This will avoid your portfolio becoming concentrated on a few highly overvalued stocks!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ikn5px2rpvl71.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff145127fe86a728e0ebd0663d8566341163aa3a)\n\n[Reverse weighted index funds:](https://www.etftrends.com/smart-beta-channel/an-etf-that-beats-sp-500-by-turning-it-upside-down/) This one is for the more adventurous, where the investments are made by turning S&amp;P500 upside down on its head! The smallest companies on the list get the largest share of investment! Even though this reduces your exposure to large tech stocks and blue-chip companies (which get a lot of attention and is possibly overvalued), your investments will be concentrated on smaller companies that are inherently volatile and can produce outsized returns! Even though this strategy has beaten the traditional index returns, you still have to consider that this type of fund was introduced [just two years ago](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sp-500-index-fund-reverse-weighting-51557430544).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe that the index fund bubble narrative is over-blown and is being predominantly driven active fund managers who are trying to stop losing their business to the passive funds every year. All the data from our research shows that we are nowhere near a situation where index funds can alter the price discovery in any significant way!\n\nWhile the index fund bubble might be getting undeserved attention, it's always a good thing to check if you are comfortable with the current skewness of your portfolio towards tech stocks. After all, the tech rally over the last decade has undoubtedly benefitted all our portfolios, but we should also be ready for when the party inevitably comes to a close!\n\nUntil next week :)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] This is the first time in an analysis where I cannot claim to be unbiased as a substantial portion of my portfolio (&gt;90%) is tied up in an index fund. So take all the arguments with a grain of salt!\n\n\\[2\\] *Setting the record straight: Truths about indexing* is an excellent study done by Vanguard in 2018 where they review the rationale for indexing\u2019s efficacy, quantify the benefits of indexing to investors, clarify the definition of indexing, and explore the validity of claims that indexing has an adverse impact on the capital markets.\n\n\\[3\\] This study also showcases that ETF trading (creation/redemption mechanism of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) has minimal impact on the underlying securities as only 6% of the trading is involved in primary market trading with the rest being in the secondary market.\n\n\\[4\\] This is also known as the Grossman-Stigliztz paradox:- There would be a point where indexing would become big enough to affect price discovery, then active managers would be able to profit off that, and more and more people would move to the active funds. Finally, in an efficient market, an equilibrium point would be reached where neither party (index funds or active fund managers) would be able to beat each other.",

Everything that requires a button in your car, fire stick remote controller, xbox controller, keyboard etc... requires a semi conductor.\n\nThe problem with the vehicle shortage is that the vehicle manufactures planned to schedule less chips in February 2021 for the vehicles of 2021 sales. They thought they would sell less vehicles this year because of the Covid, however, earlier this year, things opened and mask came off.  The car manufactures decided to instead order the same amount of chips as they usually do yearly, but the orders were already booked for other manufactures that needed chips. This is why you dont see a shortage in Smart phones, and computers, or TVS. The chip factories are producing chips for them first now before they can produce for car manufactures.

        "selftext": " \\*\\*\\*Disclaimers &amp; Disclosures: This article is meant for discussion and entertainment purposes only. The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )\n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

        "selftext": "CLBT is a monster even without a squeeze \u2014 high growth, undervalued business with top-tier team and anchor investors. Low float/volume make it a squeeze candidate which would just be icing on the cake.\n\nWrote this DD over at another sub Reddit a while ago and after today felt it was worth sharing. I see a lot of risky gaming happening on high redemption plays and while I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t make money that way, a lot of those dynamics exist here AND it\u2019s an actual quality business that is undervalued relative to peers. Would check it out and consider parking a sliver of your capital here. \n\nAs noted at the end I have a large position in this one that I\u2019ve continued to build over the last 4-6 months. My intention isn\u2019t be a shill \u2014 I\u2019m very confident institutional money will move this anyhow. And I won\u2019t dilute it to four bullet points either. Intention is serious evaluation for more long-term holders.\n\nGood luck out there all!\n\n**Team Background and Historic Context**\n\nSponsor is Trie Wind Capital. Their first deal like this, LPRO, consistently trades in the $35-40 range despite most post-merge companies getting demolished. It\u2019s a high-growth, high-margin fintech company that works in the automotive financing space, connecting credit unions and applicants for credit without taking any balance sheet risk. The use analytics to help banks and insurance companies underwrite the credit. Not sexy. Right? Wrong. The deal was priced at a material discount to its peers in the fintech world. It took a bit, but the market suddenly realized one week that it\u2019s not every day you can pick up a 40% grower with 70% EBITDA margins for \\~10x revenue. It then ripped.\n\nThe team is mostly ex-KKR guys, one of the most successful private equity firms ever. Period full stop. So its no surprise they knew how to negotiate and deliver a strong deal that made sense for their investors and themselves.\n\nI mention this because the same exact team is using the same exact blueprint for Cellebrite, and it\u2019s why I am taking a big bite of the apple for the long haul on this one.\n\n**Cellebrite Overview**\n\nCellebrite is a mission-critical and end-to-end digital intelligence platform with two key products:\n\n1. Collect and Review: Extracts and decodes data from almost all digital sources, allowing the users to unlock evidence-based data to uncover crime and fraud. This is literally the product the FBI uses to crack terrorist\u2019s phones and laptops. It\u2019s the world leader in its category.\n2. Analyze: AI-based analyses that provide insights on large amounts of data. Think Palantir for investigations. Customers report that the product accelerates investigation times by 30x, and given the nature of the investigations they often have no time to waste. Customers love the product (which is shown in the historic financials which I\u2019ll get to in a bit)\n\nThe business has a huge amount of sticky, long-term contracts. They quote over 100 North American Federal Institutions, over 2,700 State and Local institutions (everything from local police departments to state departments), and some marquee enterprises. The Enterprise segment is the most exciting portion of this business \u2013 they have anchor clients that include 9/10 of the top accounting firms, 9/10 of the top software companies, and 8/10 of the top commercial banks in the US. These anchor logos, along with their history of serving elite government institutions, establishes a level of credibility that will allow them to move down the market as cybersecurity becomes a larger and larger part of everyday life for businesses of all sizes.\n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\nWin. Retain. Upsell.\n\n1. Cellebrite is a dominant leader in its space. We call these businesses \u201ccategory killers\u201d. Currently, 90% of public safety agencies in the US are customers. More impressively, the business has nearly a 100% win rate when going up against peers for contracts. In other words, as soon as a customer needs a solution, Cellebrite is almost guaranteed to win the contract based on historic win rates\n2. THE RETENTION! Holy cow. You do not see retention metrics like this in all but the most mission-critical products. Cellebrite has 140% net retention. This means that all customers are spending 40% more each year on Cellebrite than they were the prior year. Barely any are cancelling their contracts, and most folks are instead INCREASING the amount of products they use from Cellebrite. This is enormously impressive. We hope to see 90% net retention on most businesses. Anything above 100% is considered stellar. Anything above 115% is considered anomalous. 140%? Almost unheard of for a business that has been around this long. In other words, once Cellebrite wins a contract (point 1), they are highly unlikely to lose that revenue in the future \u2013 in fact, they\u2019re likely to increase it by 1.4x per year!\n3. Continued product expansion: The reason why net retention is 140% is because most people start out using collection and review and then, upon seeing how strong it is, immediately buy more products to analyze the data, etc. On average, the difference between just the collection and review product and the full suite is 5x the revenue. Cellebrite has an enormous opportunity to increase revenue within its customer base even without winning new customers\u2026and from point (1) we know that they do win new customers with a nearly 100% rate. The growth opportunity is incredibly strong, and it\u2019s why they\u2019ve grown their ARR \\~50% in the last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/auga3enrzcu61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=784946b43d0c801627a6f56810003f1b26dfc4bb\n\n**Incredibly Attractive Deal \u2013 Sponsor-Friendly Structure and Great Valuation**\n\nThe True Wind team has decided to defer 100% of their sponsor shares until they reach price targets. They receive 40% of their shares once the stock sustains a trading level at $12.50, 40% of their shares once the stock sustains a trading level at $15.00, **and 20% of their shares once the stock sustains a trading level at $30.00.** In other words, the sponsor team believes that, just like their last deal LPRO, this business will be trading at $30.00 within the year. Why?\n\nValuation. As I mentioned earlier, this is the same exact playbook they used with LPRO. They gave up their shares until the business performed, putting their money where their mouth is. And the reason they are so confidence is how they priced the deal.\n\n[Cellebrite](https://preview.redd.it/ckvv01nszcu61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb82ee51d3b940c3bcc99bebf035f1dddf121070)\n\n[LPRO](https://preview.redd.it/k6cnipytzcu61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f95bc5fd494ec7b49c9c4f32c676a9dbc15aa333)\n\nLook familiar? Based on the competitive names in the space and how the market views them, Cellebrite should be trading at a much higher multiple than where they priced the deal. Just like last time, the market will quickly correct that gap and earn them their sponsor shares. If the market were to value Cellebrite at the regression-implied multiple given their growth, it would be worth \\~$3.1 billion today. That is a 1.7x times greater than this deal value. In other words, the stock should trade at $17.00 out of the gates and increase and the business performs through increasing margin from scale and executing M&amp;A.\n\nFinally, a major PIPE participant was strategic competitor Axon. This business is a clear acquisition target for them, and many strategics like to get a toe hold in businesses they may acquire down the line. This is a heavily bullish indicator.\n\n**Summary**\n\n1. The business is a category killer and the best at what it does\n2. The cyber market is not going anywhere and continues to grow as we are an increasingly digital society both personally and in business\n3. The business wins almost every deal that comes to market\n4. Of the customers it wins, they spend \\~40% more each year on the product\n5. The sponsor has given up all its shares until they hit targets. They are confident and putting their money where their mouth is\n6. The deal terms point to an undervalued business that should immediately swing up once the market does its diligence. \n7. A major strategic invested heavily into the PIPE demonstrating the businesses\u2019 strength relative to competition and its attractiveness as an acquisition target\n\n**Risks**\n\nA large part of the value generation in this thesis is on the relative undervaluation of the asset against peers and closing that gap. If there's a broader market correction, the regression line could shift and hamper the thesis there.\n\nBeyond that, cyber continues to be a highly competitive space and that pressure could result in higher R&amp;D spend / capex in the event competition devleops products of similar quality. The result would be a compressing margin profile and/or cash flow\n\nThere's potential reputational risk if someone uses the product for bad purposes (a la PLTR)\n\nHampered growth from a decrease in the net retention rate (unlikely to stay at 140% forever because that's ridiculously good) will need to be replaced by net new adds and upsell into that client base. \n\n**Final Words and My Positioning**\n\nI am long this business. I personally picked up a material amount of warrants (~40k) when the were $1.40ish. Given the sponsor doesn\u2019t earn a single share until it hits $12.50 and doesn\u2019t get its full payout until it hits $30.00, I\u2019m confident on this bet and willing to buy into warrants here. These guys are all ex-KKR guys who know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nAs analyst coverage continues to come out this one will continue receive attention and volume will increase on a low float (Cowen initiated at $20 PT\u2026the SPAC underwriters were Citi and DB so those are likely suspects. GS picked up coverage on their last deal as well so the True Wind guys clearly have connections). Once people discover and zero in on it think this thing is gone. So, like the KKR guys who inked the deal, I am putting my money where my mouth is.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 10, 2021**\n\nStocks extended their streak of underperformance, with the three major indexes falling once again for the fifth consecutive day of losses, one of the worst weeks for equities all year. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.78% down, closing out the week 1.57% down. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also closed the day 0.78% down, closing the week out 1.3%. The Dow Jones (DIA), which primarily weights financial, industrial, and energy stocks, closed the day 0.75%, closing the week 1.91% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its roughly year-long streak of underperformance, falling 0.97% and closing the week 2.53% lower. All year, IWM has been trading between a range of $210 and $235, unable to break out, compared to the more than 15% year-to-date gain by the SPY. Market participants remain concerned with the surge in the coronavirus Delta variant and the potential negative impact it could cause the economy.\n\nFirst off, in geopolitical news, President Biden spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in months. Afterward, Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration was considering investigating Chinese subsidies and their effect on the US economy. Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said \u201cThe Sino-America relationship is in disrepair and today\u2019s call does not seem to change this. The US appears to list actions it wants China to take, while China\u2019s demands seem minimalist, quit demonizing it and respect its red lines. Yet its red lines strike at the very heart of international order, such as its claims on most of the South China Sea and its aggressive provocative actions in the region.\u201d This also comes amid extremely intense regulatory pressures by the CCP on Chinese tech stocks, many of which have an American listing.\n\nIn other news, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. \n\nMike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, \u201cAnyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this won\u2019t be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind we\u2019re still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.\u201d\n\nNow, this is absolutely massive news and will have huge consequences in the market moving forward, especially for companies who derive a large percentage of their revenue through the Apple Store. Today,  a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Apple\u2019s 15-30% commission. Stocks like Roblox (RBLX), Bumble (BMBL), Zynga (ZNGA), and Spotify (SPOT) sharply gapped up after the announcement. I cannot stress how big this is, in 2020 Apple made $73 billion in revenue from the commission on App purchases.\n\nUnfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant. \n\nThis weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Peloton (PTON) shares gapped up after the company announced it was launching an apparel brand. It\u2019s probably gonna be the same sort of clothes that are sold in Lululemon (LULU).\n* The crackdown in China continues\u2026 This time, regulators of video game companies execs to focus less on profits and implement controls to prevent video game addiction. Companies were \u201curged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans.\n* Russian Cybersecurity firm Yandex (YNDX) said it successfully repelled the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history. This comes just after American company Cloudflare (NET) repelled the previously largest DDoS attack on Aug 19. The Yandex attack was 22 million requests per second, while Cloudflare\u2019s was 17.2 million requests per second. Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important as attacks become more complex and powerful.\n* The Italian Data Authority asks Facebook (FB) to provide clarifications on the use and function of the smart glasses to gauge whether the product is compliant with privacy laws. Like I said yesterday, I think the glasses are a bad product, don\u2019t see any use for them apart from very niche uses, like live-streaming. Not even to mention FB\u2019s absolutely appalling record when it comes to data privacy (remember Cambridge Analytica?)\n* Sales of cars in China fell for the fourth straight month amid the global shortage in semiconductors that have forced automakers across the globe to slash production.\n* Elon Musk sent an email to Tesla employees asking them to \u201cgo super hardcore\u201d to make up for production challenges to \u201censure a decent Q3 delivery number.\u201d The CEO also said, \u201cThis is the biggest wave in Tesla history, but we got to get it done.\u201d I hope they get it done, still waiting on my Model 3 :(\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) with two target raises. Stock currently around $341\n   * Morgan Stanley from $330 to $380 at Overweight\n   * Bank of America from $324 to $379 at Buy\n* Shares of Affirm (AFRM) gapped up 34% after the company absolutely demolished earnings and raises guidance. Also received a host of target upgrades, with average price target being $140 at Buy.\n* Caesars Entertainment (CZR) target raised by Cowen from $120 to $125 at Outperform.

        "selftext": "Several times this year **SPY** has broken through the lower end of its' upward sloping channel.  On 1/29, 3/4, 6/18, 7/19 the price fell below the SMA 50 on the daily chart, and closed below it.\n\nEach time **SPY** bounced back the following day, reestablishing the 50 as a major line of support for the ETF.  After the next day closed above support, the market continued on to establish a new ATH.\n\nWill that happen on Monday?  We will soon find out, but I certainly hope it doesn't.\n\nIf **SPY** continues to drop, it will be the first time this year that a break of major support had continuation.  At that point, 436 and 431.78 become the next two targets for a major breach.\n\nEither way - *do not anticipate a move, wait for confirmation before acting on it.* In other words, don't start buying *calls* or going long on **/ES** futures thinking you can predict a bottom.  You can't.  It will become clear when **SPY** has established support and it's ready to rebound.\n\nHere's what you should be doing though - making your list of stocks that are gaining strength ahead of **SPY**.  Stocks like **UPST, ETSY,** and **DASH** have all been pushing upwards during this market decline.   The next list should be of stocks that that are currently holding major support areas (**MSFT, FB,** and **AMZN** for example) - these stocks have been dragged down by a bearish market trend, but also have been able to hold support (unlike **AAPL** which broke through).\n\nWhen **SPY** finally does finds support, this is your opportunity for some high probability trades.  An opportunity you do not want to waste by trying to get ahead of it.\n\nThis means that the first thing you will need to do is, *be patient*.  This is much harder to do than it sounds of course.  You'll see **SPY** bouncing back up and watching the stocks on your list bounce up with it.  At this point you might think, \"I am missing it, I need to get in now!\".  *No you don't*.  Wait.  Make sure the market isn't just chopping around, and then getting ready for another leg down. Much like it did from Monday - Thursday of last week.\n\nWhen the market finally begins to reverse it will be clear - and it is at this point you want to start putting on Put Credit Spreads, Call Debit Spreads, Straight Calls, and Long Stock among those tickers you have been watching.  For example - let's say the market continues to drop and heads down to 431 (SMA 100), where it stabilizes and then begins to bounce back upwards.  At the same point you notice that **AMZN** is resting on it's SMA 100 around 3400.  As the market starts to go back up, so will **AMZN**, most likely recapturing its SMA 50 (3450).  You could do a Put Credit Spread of 3395/3390 for 3 weeks out and probably get a credit of roughly $1.50 for it, which is a 43% ROI.  You'll have two major lines of support above your short strike, giving you a lot of cushion on this trade.  You could also do a Call Debit Spread ATM of 3455/3460 for a debit under $2.50, as well.  Your risk is defined by your debit, which is less than 50% of the distance in the strike prices.\n\nPerhaps **MSFT** dropped down to $292, right on its SMA 50, and is also showing Relative Strength to **SPY** \\- if so you can do a one month out ITM calls with a delta of .7 or higher (probably a strike around $270).\n\nMake sure you aren't too heavy into any single sector, and you have stocks like **MCD** and **AMAT** in your list as well.\n\nWhat you want is to have several bullish plays ready to go across various sectors, and when you see **SPY** once again push upwards, you should be aggressively pulling the trigger on these trades.  *Again - not until you have confirmed that* ***SPY*** *has found support.*\n\nDrops like these provide the best buying opportunities but so often people are either unprepared for them or jump in too early.  Last Thursday (9/16), I saw many traders assume that the drop was over given the previous pattern on **SPY** and as such they started executing a number of bullish swing trades, including Calls on **SPY**.  Needless to say, on Friday their accounts took a serious hit.  Why?  Because **SPY** did not confirm a reversal, just consolidation.\n\nThere are several areas of horizontal support/resistance for **SPY**,  downward sloping trendlines you can draw on the daily chart, and major SMA's to guide you - it should not be unclear to anyone when **SPY** reverses.  On Thursday, the market breached none of these lines - so there was no reason to get bullish on it.\n\nObviously these drops provide excellent Day Trading opportunities - on Friday for example, **ZM** began to go up around noon (est) as **SPY** continued to chop around, indicating Relative Strength to the market.  At 2pm (est), that strength is confirmed with **SPY** dropping and **ZM** holding its' bid.  That ticker provided several excellent *Day Trading* entries and exits throughout the day.  **UPST** and **ETSY** were similar.  In fact, days that **SPY** is bearish give you the best insight into stocks that are strong against the market and ready to really go once that get a tailwind behind them.\n\nMany short-term traders shy away from price action like this on **SPY** and that would be a mistake.  *Day Trade* these drops with strong stocks, *Swing Trade* the reversal with high probability option plays.\n\n\\*Obviously you can and should *Day Trade* the reversal as well, but that is just a matter of looking for RS/RW as **SPY** is rebounding.\n\n\\*\\*Also note that when I refer to Relative Strength I am not talking about RSI or Beta.  There are several posts on RS/RW in r/RealDayTrading and in my post history if you are curious.\n\nTL;DR - These market drops provide the best *swing* and *day* trading opportunities, don't let them pass you by.",

        "selftext": "Alright degens,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can all agree that if you post on WSB, you're not very smart. And the longer you're here, the more not smarter you get. Sometimes they don't think it be like it is, but it do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo with this understanding that your capacity to rub two neurons together is rapidly becoming a herculean task, you may as well keep a needle on what the smart people are doing in the market. With the advent of the Federal Reserve having decided that they will force inject money into the market, you need to figure out who is 'in the know' regarding near term federal policy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnter Eric Rosengren and Robert Kaplan. Who are they? Well you sentient chair warmer, the former is the Boston Fed Chief and the latter is the Dallas Fed President. Both of these people have recently come under scrutiny for having the \"appearance of conflicts of interest\" in having sold millions of dollars worth of stocks amid the rapid growth after March of 2020. [Example.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/fed-presidents-kaplan-rosengren-share-trades-conflicts-interest-apple-tesla-2021-09)\n\n&gt;Two Federal Reserve regional presidents apologized on Thursday for [**multi-million-dollar share purchases**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robert-kaplan-stock-trades-apple-tesla-federal-reserve-president-2021-9?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest) that generated the \"appearance\" of conflicts of interest, according to multiple reports.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In simultaneous statements, Dallas and Boston Fed presidents Robert Kaplan and Eric Rosengren expressed regret for their investment decisions, which involved purchases of big-name firms like Apple, Alibaba, and Tesla.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"I have made the decision to divest these assets to underscore my commitment to Fed ethics guidelines,\" said Rosengren, per a Financial Times [**report**](https://www.ft.com/content/696b1d6b-3643-45c7-96dd-cf58a9b31cb7). \"It is extremely important to me to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Similarly, Kaplan said he wanted to \"avoid even the appearance of any conflict of interest.\"\n\nNow think about this appearance of impropriety. They have effectively been caught red handed doing what we all know and love, insider trading. So what should be the result? Divesting of profit, perhaps?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell think again, ya dingus. Apparently, all it takes to resolve this issue of impropriety is to finalize it by selling the stocks that have appreciated in value. In other words, *finish the job*. Come September 30, Kaplan and Rosengren will dutifully sell their positions on individual stocks, and hold this appreciated value in either broad index funds **or** cash equivalents. [Source.](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-officials-kaplan-rosengren-sell-143239456.html)\n\nIn my suspicion, this provides two people that are ingrained in the Federal Reserve's strategy an out. They were able to hustle for over a year on several stocks that made rapid gains as a result of their policies, and now they are making the personal sacrifice to sell off their positions for profit in public view because \"it's the right thing to do.\" In the event that we see a massive decline and point to Kaplan and Rosengren having sold right before Fed policy changes cause a massive drop, they can simply say \"I just happened to get out due to ethical obligations.\" \n\nNeither of these two are obligated to hold positions tied to the market as they can hold these now secured gains in cash. Convenient, especially in light of the growing concern that the Fed's overarching recovery strategy [has not been working at intended.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-economic-policy-powell-inflation-51631120497) In a nutshell:\n\n1. The post-2010 recovery was the weakest since WWII\n2. The Fed cannot get a handle on inflation rates\n3. Economic inequality has become even more substantial\n\nWhat do you even call the opposite of a hat trick? At the Fed, I would surmise that its called \"radical change in what we do, and soon.\" Powell and the rest of the Fed understands that the issue with these policy disasters is not knowing that you need to get out--its knowing that every day that passes makes a resulting correction more substantial. And in this case, we're talking about ripping off a band-aid that is covering a gunshot wound to the saphenous vein so we can hopefully live long enough to suture it. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nFed big bois selling their stocks at the high under the mask of being the right thing to do. Fed knows it botched the economic recovery and needs to shift gears now or cause even greater harm. Insiders at the Fed are getting out of their positions by the end of the month. Follow the people that have their fingers on the buttons.\n\n**Planned position:** \n\nSPY Long 440P, Short 420P Expiration 11/19/21. Spread premium is $4.41, underlying target price is 380 by 10/15, giving the spread a profit of $14.88. Entering this position this week.",

        "selftext": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI wanted to share an analysis of why individual investors have an advantage over institutional investors and can beat the market. Would love to hear your feedback and thoughts.\n\n# Introduction\n\nImagine you\u2019re a new investor who just downloaded a brokerage app. Now image you\u2019re in charge of an actively managed fund with a team of PhDs working for you. Both of these parties are planning on actively managing their portfolios by selecting individual stocks or bonds. Which one is going to generate higher returns? The answer probably seems pretty clear. If there\u2019s any amount of inefficiency in the market worth taking advantage of it\u2019s going to be captured by those with the most resources and the best education, right?\n\nWrong, which is what makes the stock market great. There are five key advantages individuals have compared to intuitional investors and passive funds.\n\n1. *Individual investors won\u2019t be fired after a few bad quarters*\n2. *Access to information has never been greater, and is free in most cases*\n3. *As an individual investor, time is on your side*\n4. *Smaller account sizes provide more freedom*\n5. *Individual investors can take greater risks*\n\nWe will dive into this in more detail, but first let\u2019s look at a bit of history.\n\nAdvocates of passive index investing are quick to point out that passive funds have beaten active funds 86% of the time over the past 20 years \\[1\\]. Between 1991 and 1996 it was a tossup with active funds winning three years and losing three others \\[2\\]. That time frame was chosen so that we can have a fair comparison later on. In more recent memory, passive funds have won every year since 2013 with no signs of letting up. People quickly conclude that if actively managed funds with teams of PhDs can\u2019t outperform a market index consistently that it must be nearly impossible for a retail investor to do so. This comparison sounds pretty logical on the surface but doesn\u2019t look into the differences between the two groups.\n\n**Retail investors can skip the management fees, can\u2019t be fired for underperforming, are able to invest in a wider range of companies, and can take on as much risk as they want.**\n\nArmed with these advantages retail investors outperformed market weighted index funds 49% of the time before fees from 1991 to 1996, almost the exact same rate as the active funds \\[3\\]. If you include fees that number drops to 43%. However, many modern brokerages no longer have fees to place orders. Both sides have advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other. This race is a lot closer than most people think.\n\n# Individual Investors Aren\u2019t Fired for A few Bad Quarters\n\nIf you\u2019re a fund manager who decides to go a little outside of the box and ends up buying a lot of stocks that aren\u2019t part of the S&amp;P 500 you could run into an issue. Let\u2019s say those stocks you picked ended up doing really poorly this year while the S&amp;P did fine. Managing this fund is your job. If you don\u2019t do well you could be removed from your position. Maybe they let one bad year slide, but could you underperform your peers for two years? How about three? At some point you\u2019re going to get fired. The retail investor could underperform for a decade and still come out on top. The market is very cyclical and some popular and reliable strategies just don\u2019t work for years at a time. Take value investing during the last decade as an example. The market has been dominated by highly valued growth stocks. Even if you carefully selected strong value stocks you would probably not be above the S&amp;P 500 during this period. Despite this, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by an average of 4.54% per year since 1928 \\[4\\].\n\n# Information has Been Democratized \u2013 Institutions are Still Paying\n\nWhen you have a team of PhDs working for you to help select your stocks you have to pay them. You also need to pay yourself, pay for the office, and for any other resources you use during the selection process. These costs are going to be passed onto the investors of the fund in the form of management fees.\n\n***These fees often cost between 0.5% and 1% annually \\[5\\].***\n\nThis piece is taken each year whether the fund does well or not. This means that even if the retail investor and the fund held the exact same stocks the retail investor would come out ahead.\n\n# Time is on Your Side\n\nAny active fund is going to be extra aware of their quarterly and annual goals. They\u2019re going to be frequently rebalancing to meet certain requirements whether it be a risk level, an amount of diversification, or a reevaluation of their pick\u2019s financials \\[6\\].\n\nA retail investor can hold a single stock for 40 years if they believe in the long term future of the business. Let\u2019s say both the retail investor and the fund bought Apple at the same time 20 years ago. Apple has grown an insane amount during this time frame. As one stock outpaces the rest it starts to take up a larger and larger portion of your portfolio.\n\nThe fund would likely end up selling some of their shares to bring the size of their Apple holding back in line with the rest. This also lowers their exposure to the tech sector which they would also want to keep at a certain level. The retail investor on the other hand has no such limit. He can buy it and hold it until he retires.\n\n# Size Matters But Individual Investors Can Use it Wisely\n\nThe average retail investor is buying thousands of dollars of stock at most. The average fund is buying hundreds of thousands of dollars and often millions. This is important for a few reasons. Thousands of dollars will not have any effect on the price of most stocks whereas a million dollars can move a sizeable company. The more money being invested the more it can push the price. When you are buying tons of shares the price is going to creep upwards as you look for more and more sellers. This means that the more you buy the worse your average entry price will be. The same thing happens when you sell. Unloading millions of dollars in shares is going to drop the price which means you get a poor exit price as well. The retail trader does not have to deal with this and will have better prices on both ends which leads to better performance, even if the same stocks are picked!\n\nThe size of the investment doesn\u2019t only affect the prices you get, it also influences what you can even attempt to buy in the first place. Some publicly traded companies have market caps of 50 million or less. It\u2019s just not feasible for huge funds to be buying into these companies. If a fund ever buys so much of a company that it owns 5% it will need to register that with the SEC and is forced to file beneficial own reports \\[7\\]. The retail trader will never run into this issue.\n\n# Individual Investors Can Use Risk to Their Advantage\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a few reasons why funds tend to stick the S&amp;P 500 companies. We\u2019ve also seen that they are surprisingly risk averse. Whether it be buying smaller companies, having a more concentrated portfolio, or making use of derivatives like long term call options, the retail investor has the ability to take on as much risk as they want.\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the statistics behind optimized betting you\u2019ll know what the Kelly Criterion is. In short, it\u2019s a way to determine the optimal size bet you should take\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**The Kelly Criterion says that you should be holding a little more than 200% in the S&amp;P 500 for maximum returns, at least historically \\[8\\].**\n\nThis is a heavily leveraged and high risk account but was able to survive both the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 Financial Crisis. Despite higher returns in the long term this portfolio underperforms the market for years after each crash. This makes it unrealistic for a fund manager to try to execute, but if you can handle the risk it\u2019s an option available to every retail investor who has a long time horizon.\n\n# Final Thoughts: If Managed Properly, These Advantages Allow Individual Investors to Beat the Market\n\nIt\u2019s true that most actively managed funds do not outperform their passive counterparts. This is often used to cast doubt on the performance of retail investors. If the experts can\u2019t outperform, how could you? Well, it turns out there are a lot of differences between billion dollar funds and some guy on his Robinhood app. A surprising amount of these differences offer the retail investor an advantage, or at the very least an additional degree of freedom. Using actively managed funds as a benchmark is incredibly misleading.\n\nThe odds are not in your favor as an average stock picking retail investor, but they\u2019re not nearly as bad as they\u2019re usually portrayed\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**In the same 1991-1996 study 25% of retail investors outperformed the index by 6% or more annually.**\n\nIf you dedicate the time and have good emotional control you can capitalize on these advantages most people don\u2019t even know they have.\n\n\\----\n\nTLDR; The individual investors has a number of advantages over institutional investors and can beat the market\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n1.

        "selftext": " \\*\\*\\*Disclaimers &amp; Disclosures: This article is meant for discussion and entertainment purposes only. The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. \n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

Buy call or put option when a noticeable trend on the underlying stock is visible 30 minutes after market open (between 10am to 10:15am)\n3. Wait for the underlying stock price to increase/decrease at least 0.8%\n4. Close the call/put position when the option price has gone up 10% - this could be the same day or the following day, are as long as needed to obtain the 10% return\n\nNote: the option contract would be either in the money or slightly out of the money, depending on lines of support and resistance, MCD, RSI, and other technical indicators.\n\nWhat do you think? does this strategy work? does anyone in this subreddit use this strategy? any input is appreciated.",

        "selftext": "I have been researching and investing in CASI Pharmaceuticals since June 2021. I wanted to share with you my DD and encourage you to view my 'Master File' on Google Sheets that I have linked below. \n\n$CASI is a US-based Oncology/Hematology pharmaceutical company founded in 1990 (formerly Entremed). The company has shifted in recent years to place their focus on developing and commercializing their drugs in China. This is primarily due to China's rising cancer population, facilitated approval process, less competition, and to ride the wave as more $ is flowing into R&amp;D and STEM in China than another country as China transitions from a manufacturing/industrial powerhouse. \n\nUnlike the majority of clinical-stage biotech/pharma companies, CASI already has a commercially available drug (EVOMELA) on the market, bringing in over $15 in 2020, with over 80% in sales this year alone. The CEO, Wei-Wu He, has said the drug is nearly bringing in enough revenue to cover all of CASI sales and marketing expenses. However, CASI primary and game changing drugs are CNCT-19 (phase 2 registration trial), BI-1206 (phase 1/2 &amp; 1/2a), CID-103 (phase 1), CB-5339 (phase 1) and various other assets already approved that they are submitting NMPA registrations studies for i.e. Thiotepa and Octreotide. \n\nCASI is focused on building its business through partnerships, co-commercialization agreements, and equity stakes in other therapeutic and pharmaceutical companies. For example, CNCT-19 is being developed by Juventas, BI-1206 by BioInvent, CB-5339 by Cleave Therapeutics, etc. These deals have allowed CASI to secure promising lead drug candidates, that, if approved, CASI has exclusive licensing and commercialization for the Greater China market.\n\nIn this post I would like to focus on their t-cell therapy CNCT-19 as it is the nearest to trial completion, shows very promising results, is an innovative cancer treatment for ALL and NHL, and has competitors that I can use for potential revenue modeling. If approved, CNCT-19 will be the only domestically manufactured t-cell therapy in China. Because of this CASI expects their drug to be much more affordable compared to current treats that average $300,000. BTIG release a report in May 2021, explaining that if CASI can offer their drug for under $80,000 their price target would increase from $4 to $21.  Their current CAR-T competitors include Novartis' Kymriah ($298m in revenue first half of 2021) and Gilead's Yescarta ($338 million in the first half of 2021). CASI's market cap currently sits at around $232 million, with no debt, enough cash ($73m in C&amp;CE Q2 2021) runway to fund operations through 2023, with a current burn rate of only $6m (Oppenheimer). \n\nI would encourage you to do more research on CASI and check out the master file that I have created which contains more information about their assets with all clincial trial data, financials, insider ownership, rating reports, competitors, and information on the 100,000 sq meter manufacturing facility they are building (CASI WUXI). Thank you for your time!",
