        "selftext": "I see many comparisons of the coronavirus outbreak to SARS everywhere. From the media to analysts to WSB posters, everyone loves to compare this coronavirus outbreak to SARS and say that the economy recovered quickly last time, so it will do the same this time. A lot has been discussed about the supply chain disruptions in [other reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f07zut/some_specific_details_about_impending_supply/), so I do not think it is necessary to talk about that. The differences between the diseases themselves as well as a potential pandemic breaking out has been discussed at length too, so I don\u2019t find it necessary to go into that either. What I will do is show how the Chinese economy is much weaker and much different now than when SARS hit in 2003 and focus not too much on the supply side, but mostly on the demand side and the banking industry based on the research I have been doing. I believe that even if factories reopen tomorrow at 100% efficiency (they have been struggling to reopen amidst [labor shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/china-coronavirus-its-still-far-from-business-as-usual.html)), coronavirus is completely eradicated, and everyone starts consuming at the same levels that they would have otherwise, the Chinese economy (and the world economy with it) is still in significant trouble.\n\nChina today is much different than China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, [here are some graphs that show just how different](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/coronavirus-how-china-economy-has-changed-since-sars.html). Notice how China was a much smaller share of the world economy back then (just above 4% according to this graph) compared to 16% now. Services and consumption make up a much larger part of the Chinese economy now, going from a little over 40% back then to around 52% now. According to [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Coronavirus-costs-China-service-sector-144bn-in-1-week) source, that service industry was hit with a $144b loss in a week from coronavirus. SARS was estimated to do [$33 billion in damage to the world economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/u-s-and-others-tighten-curbs-on-travel-to-china-virus-toll-hits-213-idUSKBN1ZT374), coronavirus did an estimated 330% more damage (not adjusted for inflation) just to the Chinese service industry (and I think that is an underestimate) in one week. China also accounts for over 12% of global exports now as opposed to a little over 6% back in 2003. China also accounts for [one-third of global GDP growth](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/07/25/na072618-chinas-economic-outlook-in-six-charts).\n\nChinese tourism has boomed since 2003 too. Tourism to Hong Kong has dropped off sharply thanks to the protests as well as coronavirus, [going from 200,000 visitors per day in February 2019 to less than 3,000 now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ358ruWsAA8AZb?format=jpg&amp;name=medium). Most flights to/from America (and other countries) are cancelled through the end of [March or April](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/14/world/14reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html). SARS hit a manufacturing based economy growing at a 12% rate and that was only 4% of the world economy. This is a service based economy growing at 6% (if you believe the real numbers) that is 16% of the world economy. You can't make up the tourism or services revenue like you can with manufacturing. 750m people [according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/business/china-coronavirus-lockdown.amp.html#click=https://t.co/ZuO31QVi6g) are currently under some form of lockdown. Even if these quarantines lift soon (that\u2019s a major question), the massive tourism industry both to and from China has taken a huge hit for the near future that cannot be recovered.\n\nIn December 2019, a Moody\u2019s analyst called Chinese corporate debt the [biggest threat to the global economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/chinas-corporate-debt-is-biggest-threat-to-global-economy-moodys.html). [4.9% of China\u2019s private issuers defaulted on loans in 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-default/chinas-private-firms-face-record-default-risk-to-stay-high-in-2020-fitch-idUKL4N28K1YM). This number is up from 0.6% in 2014. Banks have been [encouraged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-shadow-bankers-sneak-back-to-market-idUSKBN1ZG0D5) to give loans to tiny, risky businesses while also trying to get bad debt off their books. Due to problems with their banking system, China nationalized its first bank in [20 years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/china-s-first-bank-seizure-in-20-years-spooks-lenders-investors) last year. Then they proceeded to take over [two more](https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-nationalizes-third-bank-in-3-months_3036953.html). This over-leveraged banking system had been showing its cracks before coronavirus made China grind to a halt for a month. Questions have been raised as to whether or not the industry can be leaned on for an economic recovery as hard as the Chinese government is leaning on it now.\n\nThis was an economy [in trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html) before the coronavirus hit. The [shadow banking system](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/trouble-is-brewing-in-the-darkest-corner-of-china-shadow-banking) appears to have gotten out of control. [Shadow banking accounted for 39% and 45% of total lending in Q1 and Q2 2019](https://www.ft.com/content/4c66b622-dea5-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc). According to Bloomberg, wealth managers have been offering \u201chigh yield products\u201d to investors and have been using their own capital to make these returns whole due to that high default rate mentioned in the last paragraph. The Bloomberg article states that, \u201cbecause the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.\u201d This article is from October 2019, before coronavirus became a concern.\n\nThis is not an economy poised to bounce back like it did with SARS in 2003, despite what the market thinks. It might take a while for the market to realize it, but all it takes is a look at the data to see why that assertion is false. The market is focused on the fact that the virus won't kill us all and not on the fact that the lost revenue from Chinese consumption cannot be made up, despite the CCP propaganda that is being put out from Chinese government officials and Chinese economists. [An article from Barron\u2019s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-brings-chinas-debt-problem-back-into-light-51581679800?mod=hp_LEAD_1) has this to say:\n\n&gt;One area, in particular, is back at the forefront\u2014local debt. Policy makers have directed regional lenders to tolerate a higher threshold for bad loans, hoping to keep thousands of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from collapsing amid the economic standstill. A survey conducted recently by Peking and Tsinghua universities\u2014China\u2019s top two schools\u2014found that two-thirds of such firms said they could stay afloat no more than one to two months with their current savings. An additional 18% said they could last at most three months.\n\n&gt;Put another way, 85% of China\u2019s SMEs would crumble within three months without financial injections of some sort.\n\n[Here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/china/china%20and%20the%20world%20inside%20the%20dynamics%20of%20a%20changing%20relationship/mgi-china-and-the-world-full-report-vf.ashx) is a report from McKinsey from July 2019 that has a lot of good data in it regarding China\u2019s exposure to the world economy. I\u2019m just going to post some direct quotes and charts from the report and let you decide what they mean:\n\n&gt;In 11 of the 16 quarters since 2015, consumption contributed more than 60 percent of [China\u2019s] total GDP growth.\n\n&gt;In the United States, among the firms listed in the MSCI USA index, revenue exposure to China amounted to 15 percent of the IT sector, 7 percent of materials, and 6 percent of industrials. In 2017, US companies were estimated to have generated around $450 billion to $500 billion revenue in China through a mix of exports and revenue from Chinese subsidiaries.\n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/tebHQRv.png) is a chart from the report showing how exposed the world is to China. Luckily for us, as shown in the above report, US exposure to China is not as massive as you might think. The exposure comes mostly from the rest of Asia, Australia, and Africa instead of developed markets. However, the amount of exposure from developed countries is not negligible. The technology sector, which has driven the majority of our stock market growth, has a [disproportionate exposure](https://i.imgur.com/UeBdEB0.jpg) to revenue coming from China, especially semiconductors like Intel, Micron, Nvidia, and AMD. That chart uses data from 2017 so I would almost guarantee it is less now, but still concerning.\n\nWhile 4 of the 5 mega caps that make up [almost 20% of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s value](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323952-s-and-p-500-five-great-tech-titans-of-america) and have generated [1/5 of S&amp;P 500 returns since 2009](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-15/all-the-ways-stock-market-bulls-have-gone-off-the-rails-again) don\u2019t have much, if any, China exposure on a surface level. However, Apple derived [16.7% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/apple-impact-of-coronavirus-on-china-business.html) from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2019. Not to mention that Foxconn factories are still mostly closed down over there and not producing anything. Additionally, [20% of Amazon\u2019s COGS for private label brands is attributable to China](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-much-amazon-wayfair-will-have-to-boost-prices-tariffs-2019-9-1028499095). Due to how prevalent indexing is, I believe that a tech selloff lead by semiconductors and Apple (just like the old trade war selloffs) would drag down all megacap tech stocks and present a good entry point for an eventual recovery.\n\nAll of this comes on top of Boeing\u2019s struggles with the 737 Max, which are expected to cut US GDP growth by [20%](https://www.axios.com/boeing-production-freeze-gdp-impact-737-max-d2b3b7c9-9a3b-4a2a-a3a0-a49fb54156d0.html) in 2020. In 2017 and 2018, China accounted for [22%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-plane-deliveries-china-737-max-crash-comac-airbus-trade-deal-51579101765) of Boeing plane deliveries. In 2019, that number dropped to 12%. These struggles with China\u2019s economy and the self inflicted 737 Max struggles will put even more downward pressure on US GDP growth for this year. The phase one trade deal was expected to help Boeing out, but there are now [questions](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/14/china-united-states-trade-deal-commitments-coronavirus-trump-energy-huawei/) as to whether or not China will hold up to their end of it. \n\nIn addition to these Chinese economic struggles, other Asian countries are showing economic woes as well. Singapore just cut their 2020 GDP forecast from 0.5%-2.5% to -0.5%-1.5%. Japan released their Q4 2019 GDP numbers, showing its largest GDP decline since 2014, an annualized rate of [-6.3%](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/news-and-analysis/singapore-cuts-2020-growth-forecast-japan-gdp-slumps), coming in way lower than analyst expectations of -2.6%. This was before the coronavirus started sweeping Asia, the Q1 GDP numbers could be worse. While China is responsible for 12.6% of our trade, Japan accounts for 5.4%. A Japanese recession will hurt us too.\n\nTo summarize and give some of my personal opinions to go along with this data, I believe the Chinese economy is in a lot more trouble than most people realize. The shadow banking system is massive and their banks are incredibly over leveraged. There are questions as to whether or not banks can perform the economic stimulus that China is demanding from them to keep small and medium sized firms open. I believe that the data shows China is in very dangerous economic territory that could lead to a recession or at least a major drop in growth for at least Q1 and Q2 2020 that cannot be made up in the second half of the year. It appears to me that these China economic troubles will take a lot of Asia and other developing economies down with them. It remains to be seen if it will take the American economy down too, but I believe that semiconductors and Apple should be trading lower than their current valuations to reflect potential lost growth and revenue streams. I also see Boeing\u2019s struggles continuing to weigh on our GDP growth. I believe the market is fundamentally mispricing risk in the technology sector right now and it will overcorrect downwards in the near future.\n\nTL;DR: China\u2019s economy is potentially going down led by an over-leveraged banking system and it may cause our tech stocks, which derive supply and demand from China, to lead a market correction. Comparing this coronavirus situation to SARS is extremely disingenuous due to the state of the Chinese economy in 2003 compared to the state of the Chinese economy now. The downward pressures from China on world GDP growth as well as Boeing\u2019s pressures on our own GDP growth create a significant risk in all world equity markets that is not being priced in. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re definitely heading towards a US recession or even a global recession, but the risk should not be ignored by world markets, no matter how much liquidity central banks pump in.",

        "selftext": "Alright fellow autismos listen up. If the beer virus doesn't tank the market this is freest money you will ever see. Semiconductor stocks are way up, AMD and NVDA are printing like crazy. AAPL is still putting up impressive numbers in spite of the guidance adjustment they just gave. As some of you may know most of the big semiconductors are reliant on two companies. Here's a chart to show where the money goes:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0obj5ffxyh41.png?width=2338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb986fbced13dc0118b0af6ae24c209004810c6\n\nGlobal Foundries is a private fabricator (sorry no tendies on these guys), they focus on the older 14nm process (they tried 7nm and gave up because they found it was unaffordable to outfit a plant to fab the chips. Because of this IBM switched to Samsung for it's next-gen chips). Intel is also famously struggling to get 7nm up and running. Only two companies really have play in the 7nm space, Samsung and TSMC (traded as TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC is largest dedicated semiconductor foundry in the world. Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, and Apple all buy chips from TSMC. The more each of these companies is in demand, the more money TSMC makes. Their competition is weak right now, Samsung Semiconductor is huge, but you can't invest in them, and they only really make chips for their phones sold outside the US and for IBM (and those chips are for supercomputers, servers, and mainframes not for consumers). They mostly focus on DRAM and SSDs. TSMC is a position right now where it is indispensable to a lot of the worlds largest corporations (Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all use TSMC products). Right now all these companies are on an absolute tear. TSMC announces earning on April 16th and option prices are ripe. Go get them tendies boiz.",

        "selftext": "Alright, fellow autists, new and ready to be screwed but here's some AMD DD for you schmucks. Inverse me cause I'm totally off my rocker and my day job has nothing to do with stonks or trading. You've been warned.  \n\n\nAMD having recently broken resistance at 50 is looking to scale even greater heights. Its lining up a very strong run-up for 2020, having ripped market share from Intel in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020.  \n\n\nBreaking down into points for all the illiterate:  \n\n\n**POINT 1: APPLE CURRENTLY TESTING AMD CHIPS IN MACBOOK PROs**  \nDevelopers have found snippets of code suggesting that Apple developers were testing AMD chips within the kits. [AMD new chips are almost exactly the multi-core solution](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/why-apple-should-ditch-intel-for-amd/) apple need and If this pans out they may replace Intel in the near future\n\nThis leads us nicely into the next point...\n\n**POINT 2: APPLE WANTS TO DITCH INTEL**  \nIntel has famously suffered from shortages leading to Apple blaming them in slumps in sale in [May 2019](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/apple-blames-intels-processor-shortage-for-slump-in-mac-sales). They still can't get their shit together and [cant even confirm  if they can meet 2020 production.](https://marketrealist.com/2019/12/intels-cpu-shortage-impact-chip-giants-pc-makers/).  \nThey even wrote an [apology letter.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-sorry-for-pc-chip-delays-but-we-just-cant-meet-demand-for-cpus/) Apple are looking to jump ship and AMD are starting to look like a luxury yacht. [Expect a JUNE 3rd Announcement at Apples Developers conference](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/apple-may-start-selling-macs-with-amd-cpus)\n\n**POINT 3: AMDs THREADRIPPERS ARE SETTING WORLD RECORDS**  \nOverclockers are using [threadrippers to clock in 5,548.71MHz.](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3990x-overclocked-at-55-ghz-is-setting-world-records) This is a day after release, with overclockers till continuing to tweak and optimize their rigs. Expect top tier sales from this bad boy from PC geeks worldwide\n\n**POINT 4: AMDs are in BOTH the PS5 and in the XBOX Series X**   \nBoth console giants are will be utilizing [AMD processors in their consoles](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/could-amd-smartshift-be-the-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-secret-sauce-for-8k-gaming). What else do I have to explain? Its videogames everyone and their uncle is gonna have one.  \n\n\n**POINT 5: AMD WILL STILL BE RELEASING COMPETITIVE GPUS (BIG NAVI) AND CPUS (ZEN3)**\n\nRumors of a GPU releasing March 3 (supposedly an RTX2080 TI Killer) have been circulating, we may not see this date but [Su BAE herself has confirmed a 2020 release](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/70025/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-confirms-see-big-navi-2020/index.html).  \n[ZEN 3 Architecture was also confirmed by Queen Su](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-zen-3) and will upgrade the company's mobile offering substantially.\n\nEND OF POINTS  \n\n\nBased on all the above, I believe AMD will see tremendous progress as a company and in its stock price. If it can survive any negative corrections, we may never see these prices again. If you want to YOLO on *actual* company doing disruptive things in its industry this is it.  \n\n\nDISCLAIMER: I don't currently own any positions in AMD all my money is with SATYA for 20/3. I am planning to roll tendies into AMD once I have closed  \nI am looking at \n\n20/6 80c\n\n18/7 80c\n\nLEAPS @ 80c-90c\n\nDISCLAIMER 2: I am not your financial consultant, broker or investment advisor I am a random stranger on the internet and am not liable for any of your bad decisions.

I have a long position of 50 shares. \n\nI believe that Vail is undervalued and in demand. Of the 55,000 world-wide employees Vail retains to operate destination resorts- I am one of them and because of that I live at the fucking ski resort and I watch the snow fall and I watch the parking lot get filled to max capacity more often than not. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t know- it snowed a fuckton at one of vails recent acquisitions- Stevens Pass, Washington. Stevens Pass is significant because it serves the market of Seattle and until recently the city that headquarters Amazon, Boeing and Microsoft- has had no outlet to spend their hard earned cash on shares of this company that is worth double what it the market cap indicates it is worth.\n\nRecreational skiing is a booming business with more and more folks renting, learning from trained instructors and buying $20 burgers. When I visited Park City (owned by Vail) in January, it was BUSY! \n\nShares are near the nice round number of $250, about 1/3 the price of a ski pass. Because ski resorts are at the top of mountains, they are like impenetrable fortresses of asset appreciation- invest at the top and the bottom will reap the benefits. 270 calls for April are a good place to stash your money, but buying shares is probably a more appropriate play as volume is often low for this stock.

If you answered yes to any of these questions, follow these next two plays. $INTC puts, $50 or lower expiring next Friday or the Friday after. Not only is Intel selling off like everyone else, they are in one of the hardest hit sectors. Above all, their next gen processors are benchmarking at similar levels to AMD\u2019s current gen. While costing more I might add. This is due to intel still using 10nm technology that is inferior in every way compared to AMD 7nm. This gap in capacitor density is only going to widen when AMD hits 5nm next year. Not only that, they are losing market share in every segment, commercial servers, custom, hedt, gaming, etc. AMD also has the silicon wafer advantage due to TSMC. Lastly, $EXPE puts expiring same time as the last, at $90. Nearing all time lows in a all time correction. On top of that , the correction itself will specifically harm Expedia as travel will lessen. Your still a bull, just one that is experimenting with cock in the ass while you figure yourself out. Remember this, having gay sex once is pretty gay, but doing it all year like a gay bear is really fucking gay. Therefore bulls are still less gay. In all seriousness, you should look at this massive correction as a huge advantage. It\u2019s literally the same as buying calls, but with more gains as the crash ha sheen so drastic.

Long dated calls or just outright stock.  \n\n\nReasons:\n\n1.

AMD is seen as a market leader for tasks aimed at 3D rendering and animation. AMD Threadripper CPUs perform up to 90% faster when compare to the competition. \\[[source](https://architosh.com/2020/01/blur-and-amd-gen-3-ryzen-threadripper-save-day-on-terminator-dark-fate/)\\]\n3. Microsoft and Amazon are already deploying AMD cloud clusters and are claiming 10% lower costs to performance. \\[[source](https://www.amd.com/en/processors/epyc-for-cloud)\\]\n4. AMD  shipments are up 22% quarter to quarter and they are starting to take market share from Nvidia in the GPU market. \\[[source](https://www.jonpeddie.com/press-releases/continued-growth-in-total-global-gpu-shipments-in-q419-reports-jon-peddie-r)\\]\n5. Both the new Xbox and the PS5 will be using AMD GPUs. \\[Known\\]\n6.  In the consumer market, AMD undercuts Intel on every tier, while providing comparable or significantly better performance. Any assumptions that Intel will be able to catch up are wrong simply because even if Intel does release faster chips, so will AMD. \\[It was hard to find 1 source on this\\]\n7. Fears from the WuFlu on production constraints are unlikely to provide any competitive advantage to Intel or Nvidia as they too will be similarly affected. More importantly, the reason AMD is winning is because they have a better product at a lower price point and this will remain true as a price war with Intel or NVDIA is bad for everyone involved. \n8. Price targets for $AMD currently range between $60-65. It was the best performing stock on the S&amp;P 500 for 2019 and even during the market correction in 2018, it was able to provide consistent returns. \\[[source](https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/19/12/15035037/10-best-performing-s-p-500-stocks-of-2019)\\]\n\nPositions: I currently have 20 03/20 and 4/3 AMD 60C and 65C.

        "selftext": " \n\n**The decline**\n\nIntel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. \n\nCurrently Intel\u2019s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel\u2019s primary product, CPU\u2019s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel\u2019s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel\u2019s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD\u2019s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD\u2019s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD\u2019s \u201cmidrange\u201d workstation CPUs handley beating Intel\u2019s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel\u2019s server platform. However, the real \u201cbattle\u201d is being fought in the server space.\n\n**The server space, and Intel\u2019s vulnerabilities**\n\nData security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. \n\n2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. \n\nBecause of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD\u2019s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have *nothing.*\n\n**A story of stagnation**\n\nIntel\u2019s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel\u2019s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel\u2019s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel.\n\nDrawing back to Intel\u2019s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.\n\n**Meeting competition**\n\n[Leaked internal Intel slide](https://preview.redd.it/xyiri8120ve41.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ba9ff52ebbe2b4106f0859f13569c3e41d29e5c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are all now familiar with Intel\u2019s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end\u2019s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP\\* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat.\n\nBenchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. \n\nA few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC\u2019s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated \u201cI can't talk about any updates.\u201d Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details.\n\n\\*MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM\u2019s to prevent them from using AMD\u2019s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore\u2019s excellent video, \u201cIntel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.\u201d\n\n**The future**\n\nIntel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC\u2019s ruling and by the potential meaning of their \u201cmeet competition slide\u201d.\n\nThese findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored\u2019s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD\u2019s portfolio along with Intel\u2019s GPUs with emphasis on the internal \u201cpower struggle\u201d within Intel.\n\nIf you have any questions or I got something wrong tell me in the comments, also do not blame any of the people and or sources mentioned, all opinions expressed are solely mine, and may not reflect other\u2019s.\n\n1.

        "selftext": " \n\n**The decline**\n\nIntel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. \n\nCurrently Intel\u2019s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel\u2019s primary product, CPU\u2019s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel\u2019s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel\u2019s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD\u2019s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD\u2019s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD\u2019s \u201cmidrange\u201d workstation CPUs handley beating Intel\u2019s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel\u2019s server platform. However, the real \u201cbattle\u201d is being fought in the server space.\n\n**The server space, and Intel\u2019s vulnerabilities**\n\nData security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. \n\n2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. \n\nBecause of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD\u2019s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have *nothing.*\n\n**A story of stagnation**\n\nIntel\u2019s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel\u2019s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel\u2019s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel.\n\nDrawing back to Intel\u2019s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.\n\n**Meeting competition**\n\n [https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&amp;safe=strict&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF\\_enCA863CA863&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1\\_xJkzDKq\\_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ\\_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM](https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&amp;safe=strict&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM)  (slide, can't add the image)\n\nWe are all now familiar with Intel\u2019s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end\u2019s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP\\* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat.\n\nBenchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. \n\nA few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC\u2019s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated \u201cI can't talk about any updates.\u201d Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details.\n\n\\*MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM\u2019s to prevent them from using AMD\u2019s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore\u2019s excellent video, \u201cIntel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.\u201d\n\n**The future**\n\nIntel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC\u2019s ruling and by the potential meaning of their \u201cmeet competition slide\u201d.\n\nThese findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored\u2019s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD\u2019s portfolio along with Intel\u2019s GPUs with emphasis on the internal \u201cpower struggle\u201d within Intel.\n\nIf you have any questions or I got something wrong tell me in the comments, also do not blame any of the people and or sources mentioned, all opinions expressed are solely mine, and may not reflect other\u2019s.\n\n1.

        "selftext": "First and foremost, I have followed the energy sector for quite some time so I'll give my thoughts on what I see with the aforementioned stocks and the trajectory as a whole.\n\nThis was my post some several months ago when ENPH had it's big ITC drop; needless to say, I bought the dip but without much capital at the time. \n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpce9k/enph\\_could\\_be\\_your\\_next\\_success\\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpce9k/enph_could_be_your_next_success_story/)\n\nThat being said, let's jump in on the DD.\n\nThis year should be a great year for energy/green stocks with the rapid shifting of tech companies towards fully electric and renewable energy sources (namely TSLA, Intel, MSFT, Google, Apple, etc - all of which use solar energy as part of their operations). Considering the growth of the solar industry in the last year as well as software-driven solar tech, the energy market is consistently finding new opportunities to increase exposure in the greater market and making meaningful partnerships. Take for example Sun Power, which is one of the largest distributors of solar panels in the U.S, Phillips which is working on a sustainable energy source for TSLA vehicles, PLUG which is making deals with Amazon, Walmart, and potentially Home Depot. In fact, the U.S in 2019 has increased this sector's employment by 250,000 jobs in just Florida alone, and an increase in 31 states. Employment rate is oftentimes  a great predictor for an industry's health and outlook. Moreover, legislation such as CA Title 24 mandate requires all homes built after 2020 to have solar PV installed, and prior to this, following Lennar, Toll Brothers, and KBH, every new property developed in the last 2 years have solar installed and software-solar tech (automated thermostats). Another thing to consider is the cutting of door-to-door sales in many solar tech companies, and focusing on consultants that build partnerships for these companies. Vehicles are also starting to move into solar tech, with TSLA being the obvious front runner, but also fully electric Jaguars, MUSTANGS, and Audi's, all of which have never produced any fully electric, or even hybrid vehicles up until the recent years. The demand for solar is high and traditional energy providers (fossil fuels and standard energy providers) are starting to lose marketshare in the energy sector. This is mainly as a result of the growing issues and litigations over high winds, faulty equipment, and fires. If you take a look at solar installations, you will see a clear trend:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarts with ITC incentives have been very favorable towards these solar companies, and with the tiered tax credit incentive system that depreciates each year, people are incentivized to get this tech sooner than later. What the ITC means (for those that don't know), it's the investment tax credit which is a 26% federal tax deduction for installing solar tech in your home. And as the full electric auto market grows, there is a substantially larger percentage of residents that will have these installed. For those buying new homes this year and forward, they will come fully furnished. \n\nThere are lots of catalyst in this space, everything from the automotive industry, real estate industry, software tech industry, ITC, and general move towards renewable energy. Cloud based platforms will require an immense amount of energy to run these cloud servers, and MSFT/Amazon are already all over solar tech. This area is also just starting to develop rapidly. \n\nMy picks are, from most optimistic to least:\n\nVSLR, RUN, SPWR, ENPH, SEDG \n\nAlso, for those that are discussing FSLR, it was a huge miss but imo analyst had no reason to lift EPS this high and guidance last quarter was far too optimistic. One big reason why I believe FSLR failed is that they are the only utility-scale distributor in the mix. That means they only work with utility companies to provide energy on large grids, however, they do not fit into the category or have partnerships with commercial or residential units. Moreover, as utility companies are beginning to lose marketshare and are losing the trust of customers (especially in CA), I can only imagine that FLSR partnerships are suffering. Anyway, I lost money on my calls which will probably be at -90% at open. I thought it would ride the energy wave, but I was wrong. \n\nAlso, WSB auto hid this post. lol",

Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.\n\n**Meeting competition**\n\n [https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&amp;safe=strict&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF\\_enCA863CA863&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1\\_xJkzDKq\\_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ\\_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM](https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+financial+horsepower&amp;safe=strict&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA863CA863&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNRXSl6oKH1_xJkzDKq_rQJ9nQgoxg:1580799468163&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi964r2qLfnAhWlOn0KHakrCFoQ_AUoA3oECAsQBQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=u6UX2aKbu320mM)  (link because I can't post an image, just a link to the slide in question)\n\nWe are all now familiar with Intel\u2019s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end\u2019s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP\\* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat.\n\nBenchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. \n\nA few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC\u2019s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated \u201cI can't talk about any updates.\u201d Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details.\n\n\\*MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM\u2019s to prevent them from using AMD\u2019s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore\u2019s excellent video, \u201cIntel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.\u201d\n\n**The future**\n\nIntel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC\u2019s ruling and by the potential meaning of their \u201cmeet competition slide\u201d.\n\nThese findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored\u2019s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD\u2019s portfolio along with Intel\u2019s GPUs with emphasis on the internal \u201cpower struggle\u201d within Intel.\n\nIf you have any questions or I got something wrong tell me in the comments, also do not blame any of the people and or sources mentioned, all opinions expressed are solely mine, and may not reflect other\u2019s.\n\n1.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291cHBjPndw))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

I saw that it may cause some damage for the AirPods production.\n\n\nMSFT, my concern on this is that it is in a huge spike right now, so maybe should I wait for the first dip and buy then?\n\n\nNVDA, I like its efforts in the self-deiving cars development, edge computing, all trends that will be huge int he future imo, but I\u2019m not too sure about it, also because I own AMD and I think i should maybe get something different.\n\n\nINTC, I think that they\u2019ll have a big part in the 5G world, and also the Olympics eSport is a project I think will be a success for them.  Same thoguht about owning AMD.\n\n\nTSM, I don\u2019t know much about this company, but the semiconductor need in the future can only get higher, so seem a good investment\n\n\nLSCC, same as TSM.\n\n\n\nAlso another question is: do you think I should sell RACE to buy some of these, or keep it?\n\n\n\nAny advice and criticism is appreciated, am new to this world and wanna learn as much as possible.\n\nThanks to anyone who made it this far, have a good day!",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291cHBjPndw))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "So I bought some good and bad options on Robinhood. I am now aware that options require a vast amount of knowledge before you should ever consider starting, knowing the relationships and nuances of The Greeks, volume, liquidity, strike price, etc. I had a fair amount of knowledge on stocks before I got into robinhood and I even had an understanding of what options were and how they worked, but while I will admit I made a very unintelligent choice getting into options without carefully studying the nuances of how they work, RH does a very good job of making them seem like a fun harmless little game. So here\u2019s where I am right now. I bought puts on RCL and Carnival due to the coronavirus and I\u2019m up $22 on both however the volume is very low on RCL so I may not be able to sell the contract before close. I also bought 2 Microsoft calls, one 2/7 $177 and one later on at $180, and if it doesn\u2019t resurface at market open Monday and get up to 177.5 by the end of the week I might be screwed. I also bought a short term call on intel and INO. Here\u2019s where the story reaches its pinnacle of stupidity. When I was scrambling to get a Carnival put I canceled since the order was not getting filled and tried to buy at a higher price because I knew carnival would drop to $42 but I accidentally bought a call for $45. Yeah. I did that. So I doubled down and got 2 puts for $42. What I really want to know out of all of this, is, are RH calls and puts based on the trading of the contracts, with potential loss limited to the initial cost of the contract? Or are they like regular calls and puts which can have infinite potential loss? I\u2019m naked here and I don\u2019t understand why RH would let me buy naked calls and puts without collateral because I heard that they removed that ability after substantial losses, so how screwed really am I and what should I do? For the puts that are doing well, when should I sell? And for the calls and puts that will never get in the money, should I try and sell or will that put me in a naked position where the buyer of my contracts can financially destroy me? I tried wording this as best as I could with my knowledge of options which is low but I\u2019ve been earnestly researching ever since I realized how complex and potentially dangerous they really are, and RH doesn\u2019t offer much information from what I\u2019ve seen on their website. I would appreciate any help and I\u2019m already expecting the worst, but would appreciate any sliver of hope.\n\n[Here\u2019s what I bought.](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/cHaLQrc)\n\nTL:DR I\u2019m another one of those \u201cI thought calls and puts were as simple as RH makes them look and I don\u2019t know what to do now.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

It seems very overwhelming, and I don\u2019t know how to start. I see so many investment apps I don\u2019t know if investing on apps is worth it or not. Should I use investment apps? My friends have, and one of them sent me a link to acorns. I am a college student and apparently I get to use acorns for free. I\u2019ve done my research on investment apps and it seems like acorn is the way to go, but I thought I\u2019d ask here to see if there is any other kind of info that I could obtain before I get the app. Just as a side note, I want to invest in companies like Tesla, Intel, and AMD, if there is any other companies that I should go into I\u2019d like to know, thanks!",

What should I look into? Or is this a pretty safe way to start?\n\nThank you so much",

        "selftext": "Bout that time in my life where I should consider investing :) Long past that time actually, however I am just now getting into it none the less. I am starting with $5,000 to play with and while I feel like I know what I'm doing...I'm probably an idiot.  On my phone so sorry if formatting gets jank.\n\nSo...here's what I invested in, and my plan. I would love to hear where I'm wrong and what I should do instead. \n\nGoal: Long term investing, deposit $400/mo for next 15-20 years. Not \"play\" the market...however take some risk. \n\n\nLongs: \nMicrosoft - 8 Shares @ 184.19 - (25-30% portfolio)\nAMD - 17 Shares @ 54.91 - (15-18% portfolio) \nSquare - 15 Shares @ 82.39 - (20-25% portfolio) \nBicycle Pharma - 100 Shares @ 15.40 - (25-30% portfolio) \n\nCurrent thinking: \n\nLong Microsoft due to strength of loyalty and reserve capital to stay competitive. Basically the workhorse of productivity and corporate suites, I feel confident Microsoft will continue to be funded to expand and stay competitive in changing market landscapes.\n\nLong AMD. Simply due to Intel inability to get below 10nm and continued re-branding of the same die makes me believe AMD has a larger market cap for growth. As I look around almost every PC is intel, which should begint o shift if AMD keeps the foot on the gas around lower TDP processors. Also, gaining the new PS5 deal will be big IF Sony can control the cost and get it to market for this x-mas.\n\nLong Square. SQ is everywhere I look. As I look at payment systems in the future things like NFC/tap to pay become more prevalent. I see their brand staying strong and begin to offer new capabilities like P2P by using 2 phones NFC. The added breadth of crypto also ensures they aren't sitting on their heels. \n\nBicycle Pharam...This is the risky one imho. In this century I believe the medical industry will rely on breakthroughs in immunotherapy and phages for all sorts of treatments. Fighting cancer through Chemo is akin to lopping off the limb of a patient with a splinter. Taking medicine from catapults to laser guided missiles. Bicycle is a pharma company that, I believe, will license their platform to other drug companies for delivery. They are run by a noble prize winner, Sir Gregory Winter, who won in 2018 for his work around phages. \n\n\nFuture: I plan to keep just 100 shares of Bicycle but augment that with something like Adaptive Biotech, with the month installments mentioned above. \n\nCompanies I am waiting on to go IPO and hit hard. \n\nImpossible Foods\nSnowflake (data warehouse) \n\nThoughts? Thank you! This sub is awesome!",

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares.

        "selftext": "I was drinking my coffee when 'the flash crash' of 2/20/20 occurred.  The stupidity of the CNBC anchors spouting the same shit for the first 10 minutes was phenomenal.  'Fears of corona must have finally taken hold,' 'Trump just tweeted' (it was some banal shit that wasn't one of his usual pumps), all stupid shit their Masters in Finance degree and kneepads in risk-adverse mindset has trained them to say and has gotten them to a cushy 6 figure gig. Eventually the only hard dick dude on the air \\[source file:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp-Jw-5Kx8k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp-Jw-5Kx8k)\\], Rick Santelli notes a large Acra dump of Tech ETFs by a single seller.  Someone with tens of bills if not more decided on a casual Thursday mid-morning sale of what was enough to shake up the confidence of the entire tech industry and market as large that you saw continued Friday.\n\nSo we're in a late stage market where we all raise eye brows on any growth company that has a lower than 75 P/E since they clearly don't give a fuck about growing enough like a good little baby company should. Kinda sketchy but hey shit is going to keep going up right?  Based on how a 2% down day wiped people here, clearlying you're not YOLOing but actually FOMOing in disguise and what I'm here to diagnose you with is the FOMO on how America is shitting on just about every country's economy right now but you've too stupid to know anything aside from SPY and QQQ/TQQQ. At least you're smart enough to not know UDOW. Even then, did you know QQQ holds United Airlines? Imagine how much the CEO had to bribe Invesco to get his shit, stale company listed with the likes of Amazon and Intel.  Congrats on investing in a shit company when what you really just want is AMD/MSFT/Alphabet etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not going to go any more indepth on American economic supremacy than stating the thesis: \n\n*Institutional capital flight from uncertain and poor yielding foreign markets is causing a massive cash influx. With factors such as foreign dollar denominated debt and the race to the bottom in terms of other country's attempts at devaluing their currency to have competitive export pricing relative to their shit quality exports, the USD is overly buoyant. With a size-queen president who bullies the federal chairman into doing his bidding cuz he's going for a high score in the game of the stock market just like us with our portfolios,  we are in a perpetual state of tits not being able to go up in the U.S. stock market. Given ETFs (particularly market cap weighted) receive a bulk of this capital flight, it causes a deanchoring of intrinsic price vs market price i.e. price discovery is less-existent than before, leaving one exposed and not agile enough against algos to sudden market moves resulting in getting fucked in the ass repeatedly even when they do find a nice little value stock to play with. Also value stock seekers are just bears in disguise don't let them fool you.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat doesn't mean there won't be sector specific pullbacks like what mr. money bags caused on Thursday morning. So why be 100% in TQQQ if you want to capture American growth?  Lot of chinese shit on there anyways like lmao NIO.  It's an all NASDAQ ETF, they'll let anyone with 50k post a ticker and place a holding company in US lands to try to claw some of their country's cash back.  But yeah, stocks are going up duh, so how do you not die during these pullbacks decided by people who are called 'sir' by their staff?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Leveraged Currency ETFs**: (Examples:  $YCS 2x short yen,  $DEUR 4x long usd vs euro )\n\nLot of things to note with these.  A lot of them are thinly traded so feel free to get fucked placing a market order.  A lot of them have thin options so understand you're trading with market makers so if you place an order at ask and get cold feet the next day, yes you will be selling at bid and Citadel thanks you for the 60 bucks or whatever. I have read the prospectus of a few of these and note for the 4x leveraged ones they try to replicate one day at a time worth of value change at one specific time.  So it won't be constantly rebalancing through the day which is a plus.  However it also suffers even greater from the 5% off of 100 = 95 and then the next day it gains back 5% but oh look you're not at 100 you're 99.75 or some shit, so volatile markets they naturally decay very quick.  Sustained progression in one direction not so much which is what we are betting on.\n\n**Leveraged Country/Regions ETFs**: (Example: $YANG 3x bear china, $EPF 2x bear Euro, $ARGT 1x long argentina i.e. buy puts lmao)\n\nSo China people still eat bat soup and spread infections due to it.  Worse are the westerners who believe that story and controlled state media when the penalties for those who break from the party line is sitting beside some Uighurs in a concentration camp in Xinjiang.  There are a lot of good ones in particular YANG but as you start looking at specific countries they thin out.  Germany has some good ones to buy puts on as when they start to falter it will be magnified by the low hanging fruit countries in the Eurozone. ARGT up there in the example is non-existent for options but hey be a market maker for a day and buy a leap and be the only open interest on all of CBOE for an ETF. Oh fun fact did you know that you receive a fine of 500k in Argentina if you use your own inflation figures and not the governments?  Find countries like that and short them as all their smart money is leaving the minimum legally required in their countries (looking at you Japan), and investing in shitty US companies (looking at you SoftBank) as they elected their shit leadership in the first place.  Also buying puts against the Africa ETF is racist but please look at the portfolio holdings; the Van Eyck one is nearly all South Africa which weirdly enough is not a representative market of some Tacoma driving, AK47 brandishing warlords in Nigeria cutting off petroleum exports from West Africa.  I also just learned West Africa isn't even a country yet South Africa is!  Wild as fuck this planet we live on!\n\nTreasury ETFs:\n\nTLT the only one you need until the Fed really start printing cash pushing up short term interest rates but given other countries are in the negatives we will probably keep pushing our rates lower meaning the instrinsic value of long dated ones will be worth more.  Gonna be honest these are kinda boring.\n\n**Leveraged Treasury ETF**s:\n\nTMF is TLT's daddy that spits in your mom's mouth when giving her anal in your childhood bed.  It's 3x that so you might actually be able to retire rich.\n\n**Leveraged Volatility** (Example: UVXY, TVIX)\n\nUse these sparingly.  They are kinda gay in that they have a high correlation with shit like TQQQ going down but they do spike in world events which is cool because America may still be the bees knees but just because Russia invaded China doesn't mean our economy isn't going to do anything other than prosper long term selling weapons to both sides - so why get cucked when TQQQ goes down due to it even though most of NASDAQ will just sell robot tank truck AI CRM shared-work-space packages and make more money.\n\nSo feel free to keep losing half your portfolio every down 2% down day or realize that while you intrinsically understand America is doing super good right now, you just don't know how to capture it aside from the same three ETFs that get talked about on here ad nauseum.  Here are a few more for u to lose money on also. Oh also don't use futures or do it whatever idc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk thank you for coming to my Ted Talk if you read that all just know you took advice from someone with 4k in their portfolio, so positions as always:\n\n [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Klimt-missionaires-02.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Klimt-missionaires-02.jpg)",

        "selftext": "I see many comparisons of the coronavirus outbreak to SARS everywhere. From the media to analysts to WSB posters, everyone loves to compare this coronavirus outbreak to SARS and say that the economy recovered quickly last time, so it will do the same this time. A lot has been discussed about the supply chain disruptions in [other reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f07zut/some_specific_details_about_impending_supply/), so I do not think it is necessary to talk about that. The differences between the diseases themselves as well as a potential pandemic breaking out has been discussed at length too, so I don\u2019t find it necessary to go into that either. What I will do is show how the Chinese economy is much weaker and much different now than when SARS hit in 2003 and focus not too much on the supply side, but mostly on the demand side and the banking industry based on the research I have been doing. I believe that even if factories reopen tomorrow at 100% efficiency (they have been struggling to reopen amidst [labor shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/china-coronavirus-its-still-far-from-business-as-usual.html)), coronavirus is completely eradicated, and everyone starts consuming at the same levels that they would have otherwise, the Chinese economy (and the world economy with it) is still in significant trouble.\n\nChina today is much different than China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, [here are some graphs that show just how different](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/coronavirus-how-china-economy-has-changed-since-sars.html). Notice how China was a much smaller share of the world economy back then (just above 4% according to this graph) compared to 16% now. Services and consumption make up a much larger part of the Chinese economy now, going from a little over 40% back then to around 52% now. According to [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Coronavirus-costs-China-service-sector-144bn-in-1-week) source, that service industry was hit with a $144b loss in a week from coronavirus. SARS was estimated to do [$33 billion in damage to the world economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/u-s-and-others-tighten-curbs-on-travel-to-china-virus-toll-hits-213-idUSKBN1ZT374), coronavirus did an estimated 330% more damage (not adjusted for inflation) just to the Chinese service industry (and I think that is an underestimate) in one week. China also accounts for over 12% of global exports now as opposed to a little over 6% back in 2003. China also accounts for [one-third of global GDP growth](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/07/25/na072618-chinas-economic-outlook-in-six-charts).\n\nChinese tourism has boomed since 2003 too. Tourism to Hong Kong has dropped off sharply thanks to the protests as well as coronavirus, [going from 200,000 visitors per day in February 2019 to less than 3,000 now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ358ruWsAA8AZb?format=jpg&amp;name=medium). Most flights to/from America (and other countries) are cancelled through the end of [March or April](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/14/world/14reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html). SARS hit a manufacturing based economy growing at a 12% rate and that was only 4% of the world economy. This is a service based economy growing at 6% (if you believe the real numbers) that is 16% of the world economy. You can't make up the tourism or services revenue like you can with manufacturing. 750m people [according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/business/china-coronavirus-lockdown.amp.html#click=https://t.co/ZuO31QVi6g) are currently under some form of lockdown. Even if these quarantines lift soon (that\u2019s a major question), the massive tourism industry both to and from China has taken a huge hit for the near future that cannot be recovered.\n\nIn December 2019, a Moody\u2019s analyst called Chinese corporate debt the [biggest threat to the global economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/chinas-corporate-debt-is-biggest-threat-to-global-economy-moodys.html). [4.9% of China\u2019s private issuers defaulted on loans in 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-default/chinas-private-firms-face-record-default-risk-to-stay-high-in-2020-fitch-idUKL4N28K1YM). This number is up from 0.6% in 2014. Banks have been [encouraged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-shadow-bankers-sneak-back-to-market-idUSKBN1ZG0D5) to give loans to tiny, risky businesses while also trying to get bad debt off their books. Due to problems with their banking system, China nationalized its first bank in [20 years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/china-s-first-bank-seizure-in-20-years-spooks-lenders-investors) last year. Then they proceeded to take over [two more](https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-nationalizes-third-bank-in-3-months_3036953.html). This over-leveraged banking system had been showing its cracks before coronavirus made China grind to a halt for a month. Questions have been raised as to whether or not the industry can be leaned on for an economic recovery as hard as the Chinese government is leaning on it now.\n\nThis was an economy [in trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html) before the coronavirus hit. The [shadow banking system](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/trouble-is-brewing-in-the-darkest-corner-of-china-shadow-banking) appears to have gotten out of control. [Shadow banking accounted for 39% and 45% of total lending in Q1 and Q2 2019](https://www.ft.com/content/4c66b622-dea5-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc). According to Bloomberg, wealth managers have been offering \u201chigh yield products\u201d to investors and have been using their own capital to make these returns whole due to that high default rate mentioned in the last paragraph. The Bloomberg article states that, \u201cbecause the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.\u201d This article is from October 2019, before coronavirus became a concern.\n\nThis is not an economy poised to bounce back like it did with SARS in 2003, despite what the market thinks. It might take a while for the market to realize it, but all it takes is a look at the data to see why that assertion is false. The market is focused on the fact that the virus won't kill us all and not on the fact that the lost revenue from Chinese consumption cannot be made up, despite the CCP propaganda that is being put out from Chinese government officials and Chinese economists. [An article from Barron\u2019s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-brings-chinas-debt-problem-back-into-light-51581679800?mod=hp_LEAD_1) has this to say:\n\n&gt;One area, in particular, is back at the forefront\u2014local debt. Policy makers have directed regional lenders to tolerate a higher threshold for bad loans, hoping to keep thousands of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from collapsing amid the economic standstill. A survey conducted recently by Peking and Tsinghua universities\u2014China\u2019s top two schools\u2014found that two-thirds of such firms said they could stay afloat no more than one to two months with their current savings. An additional 18% said they could last at most three months.\n\n&gt;Put another way, 85% of China\u2019s SMEs would crumble within three months without financial injections of some sort.\n\n[Here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/china/china%20and%20the%20world%20inside%20the%20dynamics%20of%20a%20changing%20relationship/mgi-china-and-the-world-full-report-vf.ashx) is a report from McKinsey from July 2019 that has a lot of good data in it regarding China\u2019s exposure to the world economy. I\u2019m just going to post some direct quotes and charts from the report and let you decide what they mean:\n\n&gt;In 11 of the 16 quarters since 2015, consumption contributed more than 60 percent of [China\u2019s] total GDP growth.\n\n&gt;In the United States, among the firms listed in the MSCI USA index, revenue exposure to China amounted to 15 percent of the IT sector, 7 percent of materials, and 6 percent of industrials. In 2017, US companies were estimated to have generated around $450 billion to $500 billion revenue in China through a mix of exports and revenue from Chinese subsidiaries.\n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/tebHQRv.png) is a chart from the report showing how exposed the world is to China. Luckily for us, as shown in the above report, US exposure to China is not as massive as you might think. The exposure comes mostly from the rest of Asia, Australia, and Africa instead of developed markets. However, the amount of exposure from developed countries is not negligible. The technology sector, which has driven the majority of our stock market growth, has a [disproportionate exposure](https://i.imgur.com/UeBdEB0.jpg) to revenue coming from China, especially semiconductors like Intel, Micron, Nvidia, and AMD. That chart uses data from 2017 so I would almost guarantee it is less now, but still concerning.\n\nWhile 4 of the 5 mega caps that make up [almost 20% of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s value](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323952-s-and-p-500-five-great-tech-titans-of-america) and have generated [1/5 of S&amp;P 500 returns since 2009](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-15/all-the-ways-stock-market-bulls-have-gone-off-the-rails-again) don\u2019t have much, if any, China exposure on a surface level. However, Apple derived [16.7% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/apple-impact-of-coronavirus-on-china-business.html) from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2019. Not to mention that Foxconn factories are still mostly closed down over there and not producing anything. Additionally, [20% of Amazon\u2019s COGS for private label brands is attributable to China](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-much-amazon-wayfair-will-have-to-boost-prices-tariffs-2019-9-1028499095). Due to how prevalent indexing is, I believe that a tech selloff lead by semiconductors and Apple (just like the old trade war selloffs) would drag down all megacap tech stocks and present a good entry point for an eventual recovery.\n\nAll of this comes on top of Boeing\u2019s struggles with the 737 Max, which are expected to cut US GDP growth by [20%](https://www.axios.com/boeing-production-freeze-gdp-impact-737-max-d2b3b7c9-9a3b-4a2a-a3a0-a49fb54156d0.html) in 2020. In 2017 and 2018, China accounted for [22%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-plane-deliveries-china-737-max-crash-comac-airbus-trade-deal-51579101765) of Boeing plane deliveries. In 2019, that number dropped to 12%. These struggles with China\u2019s economy and the self inflicted 737 Max struggles will put even more downward pressure on US GDP growth for this year. The phase one trade deal was expected to help Boeing out, but there are now [questions](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/14/china-united-states-trade-deal-commitments-coronavirus-trump-energy-huawei/) as to whether or not China will hold up to their end of it. \n\nIn addition to these Chinese economic struggles, other Asian countries are showing economic woes as well. Singapore just cut their 2020 GDP forecast from 0.5%-2.5% to -0.5%-1.5%. Japan released their Q4 2019 GDP numbers, showing its largest GDP decline since 2014, an annualized rate of [-6.3%](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/news-and-analysis/singapore-cuts-2020-growth-forecast-japan-gdp-slumps), coming in way lower than analyst expectations of -2.6%. This was before the coronavirus started sweeping Asia, the Q1 GDP numbers could be worse. While China is responsible for 12.6% of our trade, Japan accounts for 5.4%. A Japanese recession will hurt us too.\n\nTo summarize and give some of my personal opinions to go along with this data, I believe the Chinese economy is in a lot more trouble than most people realize. The shadow banking system is massive and their banks are incredibly over leveraged. There are questions as to whether or not banks can perform the economic stimulus that China is demanding from them to keep small and medium sized firms open. I believe that the data shows China is in very dangerous economic territory that could lead to a recession or at least a major drop in growth for at least Q1 and Q2 2020 that cannot be made up in the second half of the year. It appears to me that these China economic troubles will take a lot of Asia and other developing economies down with them. It remains to be seen if it will take the American economy down too, but I believe that semiconductors and Apple should be trading lower than their current valuations to reflect potential lost growth and revenue streams. I also see Boeing\u2019s struggles continuing to weigh on our GDP growth. I believe the market is fundamentally mispricing risk in the technology sector right now and it will overcorrect downwards in the near future.\n\nTL;DR: China\u2019s economy is potentially going down led by an over-leveraged banking system and it may cause our tech stocks, which derive supply and demand from China, to lead a market correction. Comparing this coronavirus situation to SARS is extremely disingenuous due to the state of the Chinese economy in 2003 compared to the state of the Chinese economy now. The downward pressures from China on world GDP growth as well as Boeing\u2019s pressures on our own GDP growth create a significant risk in all world equity markets that is not being priced in. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re definitely heading towards a US recession or even a global recession, but the risk should not be ignored by world markets, no matter how much liquidity central banks pump in.",

        "selftext": "Alright so here\u2019s a brief rundown while I wait to hear back from u/WSBgod for permission to post more details.  For now, this is what I\u2019m sharing.  \n\nLet me start by saying that during the mania today, my position was that the whole thing was a hoax.  Many comments were focusing on how options prices were nicely rounded 100.00 and shit like that.  While I didn\u2019t have time to really dive into those details, I was skeptical simply because he claimed to go from $4 million to $8 million.  Nicely doubling your bet is not something you typically do with options, that\u2019s what you do with roulette when betting on black.  It was just too clean.  Of course, it was also very lucky and extremely ballsy\u2014neither of which is uncommon on WSB.\n\nNevertheless, [I took the post down](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f006zu/wsbgod_post_removed_pending_indisputable_proof/) until there was indisputable proof.  Behind the scenes, this was roughly the exchange in modmail with timestamps.\n\n***\n\nHere's the timeline (all in central time)\n\n&gt;1:55pm u/ITradeBaconFutures stickies a comment on mega thread saying [\"Proof or ban\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezwbve/reports_of_my_death_have_been_greatly_exaggerated/fgq6q81/)\n\n&gt;3:32pm u/WSBgod messages mods and asks \"What do you recommend?\"\n\n&gt;3:34pm I reply \"idk but it better be good. I'm recommending a screen sharing session\"\n\n&gt;4:28pm u/WSBgod replies \"I'm happy to verify, have nothing to hide and my post history is the best evidence a person could ask for. But I won't do anything that reveals personal information, login credentials, or anything that could be used against me.\"\n\n&gt;4:53pm \"This should be all the evidence you need:\n\n&gt;&lt;link to imgur with his account summary&gt;\n\n&gt;PLEASE do not share this or pass it around and make me regret doing your verification. I know you need to verify to keep BSers off here, but please keep my privacy in mind. Thank you.\"\n\nThe picture was a screenshot of his account summary from his broker with many trades, including tesla\n\n&gt;4:55pm \"Not good enough sorry.\"\n\nThen there was bickering back and forth about what standard of proof meant, and what we could do about it until u/WSBgod capitulated.\n\nAt 5:18pm He accepted the screenshare which we did shortly after.\n\n***\n\nWe went on discord and he shared his screen, where he had a chrome window up with a couple of tabs open to vanguard, one of which was logged in and had a clearly visible **SSL** icon to the left of the address.  He scrolled around (without hitting the top of the screen where his name/account would show).  Once he was done showing me the numbers, I asked him to refresh the page.  He then took the discord window and carefully placed it such that it covered only the contents of the website to hide his name from showing up after the refresh.   The \u201cdiscord censor window\u201d was small enough so that I could see the address bar at all times, and most of the contents of the webpage.  There was no keyboard shortcuts\u2014everything was done by mouse.  He clicked the refresh button, and after a visible refresh of the site, he moved the \u201cdiscord censor window\u201d and showed me that all the numbers remained the same.\n\n***\n\nI\u2019ve taken the video and edited it such that it removes all personal information, but I can\u2019t in good conscience publish it without his consent.  Doing so would eliminate the possibility of anybody ever trusting me (or the mods) with any sort of proof again, and for that reason I will wait and hope to get permission to post it.  Otherwise this is the extent of what I\u2019m sharing.\n\nSo the question remains, could this be fake? Absofuckinglutely.  Could he fake the url, website, broker summary, ssl certificates and inspect/refresh? Yes.  Of course it can be faked.  For all the retard talk that\u2019s thrown around, you all are actually really fucking capable (you\u2019ve proved it time and time again).  I\u2019m not saying that u/WSBgod\u2019s claims are irrefutable, I\u2019m just laying out the proof he gave me.\n\nWhen people make huge ass claims, as mods, the best we can do is ask for \u201cproof.\u201d  Short of asking for his username and password, this was the closest thing that I could think of and I gave him a very short window of time.  Never in the history of WSB have I ever asked to log into somebody\u2019s computer to see their screen. There\u2019s no precedent for that and there\u2019s no reason for him to have anticipated that.  u/fscomeau faked a video but he filmed, edited it on his own time and uploaded it to youtube.  In today\u2019s case, I gave u/WSBgod less than 2 hours to let me on his computer and he did exactly what I asked him to do once I was watching his screen.  As a mod, that is as much proof as I can reasonably ask somebody to give me.  And as a mod, I'm sharing it with you.  If there\u2019s a better method of proof, I\u2019m open to ideas.  If he faked it, then congrats to him for doing a good job at faking and anticipating my response when asking for proof.  And if he made money then congrats to him for scoring big.\n\nThe last note I\u2019ll share is his account balance **did not show $8 million dollars**.  The total balance was slightly less, but it was pretty damn close.  \n\nI\u2019ll let you decide for yourselves based on this information and I hope to be able to post the video soon.",

Going to see my brother on Sunday to see if he will write me a cheque for it so I can deposit it in the bank and then fund my trading account by Tuesday-ish. \n\nIf not, just going to deposit the cash and say that I got it from a friend as a loan.

Tesla (TSLA) stock has stormed Wall Street with its price surging a whopping over 80% since the beginning of 2020.\n\nShort-sellers are burning their hands on Tesla as the electric car maker released its strong Q4 2019 numbers last week. In less than a week, the Tesla stock has added over $200 to its price making it the first American automobile company to hit $100-billion valuations.\n\nOn Monday, February 3rd, the Tesla stock surged 20% to $780 levels taking the company\u2019s valuations at $140 billion. Indeed, with this move, Tesla has taken Wall Street and global investors by surprise. Monday\u2019s stock price gain was the biggest one-day surge of Tesla in the last six years.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, the Tesla stock price is up 85% in one-of-its-kind performance. Tesla\u2019s stock performance has forced analysts to revise the calculation and set up new targets ahead.\n\n\nhttps://thecoinrise.com/tesla-stock-hits-780-raising-more-than-80-since-the-start-of-the-year/",

No, I'm still alive and still selling options on TSLA. \n\nSadly I closed those naked calls on Tuesday last week and did not benefit from the the complete reversal on Wednesday. That 69k day loss would have been no loss plus a gain if I were to have held til Friday. However since I was way over leveraged and had negative 113k option buying power that morning, I don't think riding it out would have been a good idea. Shit could have continued up for all I know, and that would have deepened the losses. Life goes on. I could have moped and stayed home, but I actually went out to the gym soon after market close, and then the grocery store afterwards. Still have to eat and workout, even though it was the worst trading day of my life.\n\nThe lone Feb 21 $480c was nearly a reverse 100 bagger when I closed it. Quite possibly the WSB record for a reverse bagger, not that anyone would want to break it. Sold for $4.50 credit, bought back in the $410 range I believe ($40k loss on that strike alone).\n\nMy goal is to get back to even on the year on TSLA alone. I won't give any updates until I get there (if I do). Similar goal is to get back to positive for the year overall even if I don't quite get there with TSLA. Will provide an end of year update. I'm sure you can get an idea of how I'm doing based on my post/comment volume. I tend to turtle when shit is going bad in order to focus on trading. \n\nDespite TSLA only moving 0.68% Tuesday, I happened to capture $11.6k due to the nature of being short vega and benefiting from a drop in volatility: \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hQBre71.png\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns. If you're going through a hard time or similar losses, remember that it isn't the end of the world. It's a blessing and privilege to be able to trade. We once started with nothing. Money comes and goes, and it's not the most important thing in life.",

He was known for his AutoModerator work, teaching AI to recognize Robinhood Screenshots via TensorFlow (I think), mass banning script, bot skills, and much more.

        "selftext": "Oh boy, where do I begin. I just wanted some people to share my story with. Very few friends (1), no family. I hope that it's not the end of the road for me. You guys can be my friends too. I did enjoy my time spending here.\n\nI'm genuinely somewhere on the assburger spectrum. Have experience in a few graduate level work. PhD in physics and masters level experience in two other STEM fields. Got hired by an AI consulting firm with 100k salary. Worked for a year or so there, saved up about 30k. I was the best at the office! Delivering results after results and my superiors loved me.  Even got a raise near the end of last year. Annual review was stellar.\n\nThat changed when my superiors handed me a project that made no sense at all. They have no relevant experience, and they wouldn't listen when I told them that it is not going to work. They must have signed a contract with clients. I had no say in what projects are feasible even when I have the experience. I tried to get something to work - but in the end they just told me not to do it. Note that I still got a raise at the end of year review. \n\nThe manager misunderstood some key concepts and I tried to tell him. He doubled down and pretty much called me an idiot (note that I had 10 years experience more than him). I stopped going to work social functions. I think that this is the reason why I got fired. There was no warnings what so ever. I don't even know what I did wrong. \n\nMy first bet was on BYND put $6000 for Feb 25 125c just a day after it went parabolic early January. It went so high! I think it reached a price of $125 in two days, and my $6000 turned into 24k. I was a moron and didn't sell. Only panic sold when it was at $12000. Making a 6k profit. I thought I really cracked the stock market with my TA then. And I kept making OTM bets like that. I thought BYND was a good stock so I kept buying calls on it. \n\nThen the beer flu happened. Everything just dropped, and I sold everything,  taking a 80% loss. Account down to about 6k. RIP. But I'm determined to build it back up. Did some researches on meme stocks everyone's talking about and found out SPCE. Everything seemed to click, many catalysts in the near future, and Richard Branson just won't die in a rocket crash. I put everything in and it's at about 10-12k. I shared what I found with WSB and everyone seemed to like it, I'm glad that I was able to help you guys print money. The post was here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f18oud/spce\\_is\\_going\\_parabolic\\_very\\_soon\\_and\\_this\\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f18oud/spce_is_going_parabolic_very_soon_and_this_week/).\n\nI feel like I'm going to take on another career path. Too much political correctness in AI, I was actually trying to look around for another job for a few months. Even given my experience and credential, it was very hard to get an offer. I guess being being an aspie can't really bond with the interviewers during the short times spent in interviews. I'll talk to my personal trainer next week and see if I can find a job as a trainer. At least I will be able to help guys get healthier, which is a much more meaningful job than making sure AI's aren't racist.\n\nIf you get through this far, thank you. I really appreciate. I just wanted to share this with someone. Peace.",

At all. And at the risk of sounding alarmist, I am going to put my neck out there and say that this thing is the inevitable shock that always seems to kick off a recession. With that said, it's going to take a little bit of time before markets digest the supply shocks that are going to come through from China's shutdown. And past that point, I really don't think anybody is pricing in the fact that this is going to start to mandate shutdowns elsewhere. \n\nThe funny thing, is that from a data perspective, we actually were starting to get a mild recovery in the macro regime, suggesting the Fed may have actually engineered a sort of soft landing, at least for a short bit. Given, that soft landing would be heavily stimulus and debt fueled, but, the means don't matter in the short term.  But this item is coming at a very very very bad time, and the economy just is not prepared to handle this even slightly. The markets obviously are not reflecting this right now, but markets are not efficient, and there are a variety of reasons for this.\n\nI will say, we likely will see some sort of massive wave of additional stimulus, or at least an attempt at it. But the transmission mechanisms of getting said stimulus to the people who need it is going to cause this to falter when it's needed most.",

I'm hearing valuations of 50B, 100B, etc. Currently it is valued at 5B per the ticker value. \n\nSo lets do some math here.\n\n5B valuation - company has 120M in potential revenue for the 600 customers (250k per ticket).\n\nThey will probably begin flying something after July since they are trying to reserve the first flight for Sir Richard for his 70th birthday, so I'd imagine the 600 pre-ordered customers will have to fly thereafter which should take up the rest of the year. \n\nAt 5B, they are valued at almost 42x their revenue. That's at roughly $30 per share.\n\nThen there's raging bull over there with 750k in options talking about seeing $50 end of this year, that's 8.3B valuation. only 69x their revenue. YEAH 69.\n\nThen we have retard analyst over there telling his relatives to buy up those calls to make them proud on television talking about $60PT. Which is an 82x revenue.\n\nJust think about it. Space tourism is big and all, but SPCE cannot scale like BlueOrigins or SpaceX. The moment these guys IPO, these analysts and fake bulls gonna hop right over like a gold digger.\n\nAnd, even at 5B valuation, let's say a reasonable revenue forward is 20x. That's still 500M in revenue that it has to do. Do the math again, based on the 250k pricetag, that's about 2000 passengers a year. \n\nHow many millionaires you think gonna drop 250k on a couple minute trip in space each year? 2000?",

I made $16 from investing $80, which the easiest money I had ever made. \n\nJump to August when I open an account and pour $700 into a single ADSK call day before earnings. LOL dumbass to the stars over here lost $600 because ADSK fell 10 f\\*\\*king percent post-market. Died a little. Irrationally &amp; with little research began yoloing in hopes to gain back what I had lost. Come to it 2 months later down -$1100 relentless mocking red every time I opened the app. \n\nDown to the last $1800 to my name (being that I'm a high school student.) Finally do research, self teach. Take a week to figure shit out and jump back on the wagon. At this point, I am a walking (options basics) Investopedia page ready to find a company and hit it big. Lost another $1100 three weeks. Crippling regret brings me to yolo the last of it into calls for SNAP a company I had been following and doing DD on. MFW it actually works and hit a gap up in the following week. From $700 to $1200, then $2300. By this time it's mid-December and I'm 100% in SNAP calls every week. December 30th and I'm finally at a net positive, $4,600 (give or take.) I invest it all 31st before the new year and market open on Jan 2nd mark my first huge profit and the beginning of (probably the most lucrative month of my life) my tendies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kept in SNAP calls until about JAN 14th when news broke of the novel coronavirus. At this point, I'm at +$52,000. The Friday before the 24th I go bearish (hey, tendies are tendies no matter how you get them) 17k into SPY puts. The market opens &amp; HELLO SIX FIGURES!!

If the shares continue to rise, dynamically managing that hedge can entail increasing purchases.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cSo, now you get the picture, that every day **at the open lately, folks are grabbing call options quickly and driving the stocks/indexes higher,\u201d** writes Scott Murray of Volatility Analytics. \u201cIt is much easier for this kind of market to be unhinged, as long call holders\u2019 corresponding dealer position is long the underlying.\u201d\n\nSo /r/wsb thinks it discovered the holy grail, because it learned that sellers of options hedge their delta. \n\nu/SuXs, managed to distinguish himself from the imbecile masses of the subreddit, by appearing to truly believe that if he manages to convince some people to buy $200 MSFT calls, the dealers will buy enough shares to offset their delta to make a $1tn stock rally. \n\nJust check out his recent submission history - reads like a strong CV for a position of a full retard: [https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png](https://i.imgur.com/x3T544x.png) \n\nNews flash - delta hedging becomes a factor when a stock goes up 20% in a day. Or 100% in a month.  Not when you place a $100k (let's be generous) order for $200 MSFT calls. Also, while TSLA can conceivably go to $1000 or $1200 or $700 over the next week, those kinds of moves are not in cards for MSFT - hence even less need to aggressively delta hedge.\n\nMSFT is a solid company. But today, I sincerely hope it totally shits the bed or else you dumb motherfuckers will really believe that by having 20 guys spend $300 each on an OTM call you can make the share price of a $1tn company go up.\n\nBTW buying OTM calls at the open has nothing to do with HFT spoofing of orders that Navinder Sarao got busted for. That guy was just flashing a huge order on the bid side to move the market marginally up (and opposite for ask side). He never intended for those orders to be filled, so he was quickly cancelling them after getting the desired effect.\n\nSometimes you make me ashamed to be part of this subreddit.\n\ntl;dr; the post is not about advocating selling of MSFT (I have no view on the stock), the title is a clickbait.",

I could then turn around and write a call option on that same stock at a price that exceeds my cost basis and collect premiums until it is ITM. I then sell for a profit.

These measurements indicate that Microsoft Corporation \\[MSFT\\] is generating considerably more profit, after expenses are accounted for, compared to its market peers.\n\nThis company\u2019s Return on Total Capital is 23.74, and its Return on Invested Capital has reached 19.90%. Its Return on Equity is 42.41, and its Return on Assets is 14.39. These metrics all suggest that Microsoft Corporation is doing well at using the money it earns to generate returns.\n\nTurning to investigate this organization\u2019s capital structure, Microsoft Corporation \\[MSFT\\] has generated a Total Debt to Total Equity ratio of 84.49. Similarly, its Total Debt to Total Capital is 42.52, while its Total Debt to Total Assets stands at 30.17. Looking toward the future, this publicly-traded company\u2019s Long-Term Debt to Equity is 15.87, and its Long-Term Debt to Total Capital is 77.31.\n\nYou're not still reading this, you're commenting something about \"TL:DR which strike\" and I actually copied the above paragraphs from an outdated article. This is not real DD and while I'm sure 90% of you have stopped reading -- oh who am I kidding, 99% of you have stopped reading up until this point that literally nothing I type here matters. \n\nThe only substantial point you should take away from this is you need to buy MSFT calls and pump up the price this week because while my calls are expiring in April, I have no intention whatsoever in letting Theta trap me in losses until then and I really need to get out of this position to make money in other places this week and next. Okay, back to the con.\n\nShares of Microsoft Corporation \\[MSFT\\], overall, appear to be a solid investment option, with Wall Street analysts expecting its price to rise considerably in the next 12 months. This company generates high value from the labor resources and other capital it has available, and while it has heavy Long-Term Debt to Equity, the majority of the metrics point to this investment being highly attractive. \n\n**As you can see, it's the perfect time to buy MSFT calls.**",

They\u2019re the market leader in diabetes monitoring technology. They monitor your blood sugar levels via non-invasive techniques (basically no needles or blood involved) and you can track your blood sugar anytime, anywhere through your phone or smart watch. Pretty revolution stuff, they\u2019re first to do it too. If you\u2019re blood sugar is outta wack it notifies you so you can get your insulin pump and get it back to normal.\n\nNot convinced yet? Well here\u2019s the low. I\u2019m a med student, I\u2019ve seen patients with diabetes, every type 1 diabetic patient is buying one of these monitoring kits if they haven\u2019t already. Hell even Karens are buying them for their kids just to make sure their precious angel\u2019s blood sugar are in normal range.\n\nThe number of diabetics is only increasing, so the market for this monitoring device is only gonna go up with it. What\u2019s better is these will be life long customers since the disease can\u2019t be cured. This is reflected on the stock, up 12% in the last day, 18% last week, 21% last month, 40% in the last 3 months.\n\nSo what the fuck are you fucking autists waiting for? Get your sugar rush now and get some god damn calls. The more people buying this stock, the more publicity this stock gets, the more people with diabetes hear about it and buy it. Literally can not go tits up. Get your calls and thank me later, fuckers.",

        "selftext": "Since it's a holiday and we're all bored anyway I'm going to give you some *very* basic things to think about before you open a position. Who am I? I'm just a random dude with some business and finance education. I have had limited success and failures (over the past two years I've been up 90% and down 60%), but the key is that I *haven't cashed out of the game yet*. So, if you're looking for ways to justify your gambling addiction, read on. If you want to be the one retard who learns something today and not the 9 retards posting stupid shit in the comments, read on.\n\nToday I've picked a nice mix of glaring WSB faults and interesting things:\n\n1. Risk and reward expectations\n2. Stock and Options packages (ETFs and multilegs)\n3. Research aka Due diligence (DD)\n\nLet's dive in friendos!\n\n**Risk and reward expectations** \\- Generally investment managers, financiers, and traders gauge their performance for a quarter or year based on how they did **relative to the market**. So if the S&amp;P 500 only grows 6% in a year, a trader is successful if they made 9% gain that year. If the S%P 500 grows 20% like in 2019, you could literally just park your money in stocks and sell a year later for 20% gain, no skill involved. **Historically, the market has grown 10%** ***a year.*** I mention this in bold because most newcomers here really need to have their risk/reward expectations reframed. Usually the rewards are directly related to the risk that you lose everything. Doubling your money with a yolo call position is *incredibly risky and you are likely to lose all of your money*. This isn't a bear/bull thing (which is fucking stupid anyway. Imagine gambling/investing based on a fucking animal mascot). Pouring your money into shares of an S&amp;P 500 index is much more safe and likely to preserve your money. I think there is a big contingent of big brained smarties on this board who want much more risk and reward than buying shares, but don't want to fuck in the dark on WSB meme options. If you are ok making 5-10% a week instead of 5-10% a year, read on.\n\n**Stock and options packages** \\- Stocks get packaged up by companies and resold to you in two ways: mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are pretty much the same thing - a bundle of stocks that you buy into - except ETFs are... exchange-traded aka sold as shares. Why do companies do this? To hedge against the risk we talked about before!\n\nWe need to digress for a second into different kinds of risk. If you had 0 toleration for risk, if you wanted a virtual guarantee of not losing money, how can you invest? You can buy **US Treasury bonds.** The rate of return on US treasury bonds is literally called *the risk-free rate* in finance and is about 1.6%/year or something right now. Pitiful. In our desire to see bigger returns *we must take on bigger risks.* There is **firm specific risk** related to the operations and financing of a specific firm ($BABA, $MSFT, $ADI). Let's say we didn't want to deal with this risk. We just want to take advantage of their growth of an industry, sector, or the market as a whole, without getting burned by the mistakes of any one individual firm. Then we can *diversify away* *firm-specific risk* and deal only with **market risk** by purchasing shares of every company in an industry, sector, or market. So State Street Global Advisors purchases a weighted average of the S&amp;P 500 and sells that package to you as $SPY. Any one success or failure in the S&amp;P 500 doesn't make SPY move much; it moves the way the market moves in general.\n\nOk, so, there are indexes/ETFs for everything. Whole market, biotech, manufacturing, industrial power, you name it. These are incredibly successful products - $SPY, $TQQQ, $PEY - because they are less risky and move slower than the individual stocks in the funds. What's the deal with options packages? **Options packages hedge risk in exchange for lower returns and are available on Robinhood (but never take the pre-built offered packages)**. Take a second at this point to go to investopedia and get a handle on spreads - you'll see things like Bull/Bear Put/Call credit/debit spread.\n\nSo let's say you have a belief that $MSFT is going up, but you don't want to *risk* everything on straight calls that could expire worthless in a week. You have some *options* (pun intended). You can reduce your risk by changing the rules - open a *bull put (credit) spread* so that you don't need $MSFT to go up, you just need it to not go down. Or you can lower the cost of your calls (and the reward) by opening a *bull call (debit) spread.* What I love about these is that the only cost/collateral RH requires is that difference between strikes in a spread. For instance, I have a SPY bull put spread right now with strikes at 330 and 329 - RH required $100 in collateral and gave me 12 dollars credit when I opened it (the difference between selling to open the 330 put and buying to open the 329 put), and I think I can close it out this week for a cost of 5 dollars, netting me 7$ on my 100. That doesn't sound flashy except that *7% a week is literally rich people insaneo gains on a relatively safe bet.* If you've read this far, my secret volatility play this week is opening a condor tomorrow on $ADI and closing it after earnings. EPS is estimated to be pretty low, but the firm's operating cycle is absolutely solid, so I think it'll move sideways on the news and we're going to make money on the IV crush. $1 spreads on the low and high ends, with strikes roughly 6% out of the money. Open it for 30 bucks credit tomorrow, close it for 15 bucks debit on Thursday.\n\n**Due Diligence** \\- DD is more art than science, and it's going to look different for stocks than for options, but in either case often the only difference between sweating nervously for a week while you look for a way to not lose so much, and relaxing confidently in your purchase, is 15 minutes of research. **The price of a share is related to the performance of the firm, even in 2020.** If you're trying to do DD on a specific firm as an amatuer, you want to look at 3 things - Quarterly/annual reports of earnings, analyst opinions, and the sector as a whole. Let's take $MSFT for example: Big revenue growth each year for the past decade, analysts say that Azure and Teams are solid products, and the tech sector is growing, so there's room for $MSFT to go up without having to take market share from competitors. That info took me 5 minutes to find, and with it I'm very confident that purchasing shares of $MSFT is a good idea. You can usually go to a company's website to find their financial information in a government tax filing form called a 10-k, but that can be pretty dense. You're looking for a page called the Balance Sheet.\n\nAnyway, hope you had a good read and learned something. If not, fuck off and lose all your money and disappear unnoticed in a few weeks like 99% of the people on this board.",

        "selftext": "I'll keep this short and sweet. LSCC (Lattice Semiconductor) is announcing earnings tomorrow and is worth your consideration as a YOLO for two reasons:  \n\n\n1.) Jim Anderson, the CEO  \nThis fucker used to be my boss (corporate overlord, I never met him). Our company was sold to AVGO back when they were trading at $65/share and Mr. Anderson made out like a bandit on the increase in value in his shares. Then in May of 2015 he went to become a VP for A-M-Fucking-D. In case you were too young to remember what AMD's stock price was back then I'll remind you. It was $2.30. Motherfuckin' Jim stayed on until August of 2018 and then peace'd the fuck out to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor. You know what AMD's stock price was in August of 2018? Twenty-Five-Fucking Dollars. Homeboy literally worked for three goddamn years and 10x'd on AMD.  \n\n\nSo August of 2018 he goes to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor when their stock price is around $7.50 and sneaky Jimbo goes and delivers a terrible earnings, tanks the price all the way down to $5 bucks so he can accumulate shares like the sly multi-millionaire fucker he is. Then the stock proceeds to fucking skyrocket up to a peak of $24 over the next 12 months.  \n\n\nSo that's reason number 1. Follow the money. Follow Jimbo.  \n\n\n2.) TeCHNiCAlS  \nLSCC closed at $19 flat today, which is in the middle of it's $17.50 to $21.50 range over the last 5 months. However it peaked at $24.2 just 3 weeks ago.

        "selftext": "For example, why not just buy a long-term call option (an actual good legitimate proven company that\u2019s clearly poised for more growth such as MSFT or VISA) that expires January 2021 with the closest strike price from the current share price? Yes, the option price is going to be expensive but assuming you have somewhat of a significant capital to play with (let\u2019s say at least 30 grand or beyond), wouldn\u2019t it be relatively easy to rack in $1000+ profits once your strike price hits or it goes above? Why don\u2019t more people do this as there\u2019s very very minimal risk to it? \n\nFor example, let\u2019s say I buy a MSFT call option that expires January 15th 2021 with the price per option being roughly $13.43 and I buy 22 contracts (x 100), which would equate to about $29,5400. I can bet my fingers, toes, and testicles that MSFT will reach $195 SOMETIME before January 15th 2021 (They say only death and taxes are guaranteed, but come on, let\u2019s be real, this is a guarantee). Fine, worst case scenario, let\u2019s say it takes another 1-2 months for MSFT to reach $195 \u2013 still, if I wait 1-2 months and it\u2019s at $198, I\u2019ll still make over $9K, which I\u2019ll be very happy with. Is this not a viable strategy if you have the capital? Why don\u2019t more people just risk more capital on long term call options with the closest strike price from the current price? Am I missing something here? If I understand correctly, you can hold your position for as long as you can before the expiration date and sell whenever you want once MSFT reaches $195+.",

        "selftext": "Renaissance Technologies is the Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time.\n\nFounded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average gross return of 66.1% since 1988.\n\nWith an average net return of 39.1% after fees.\n\nThe Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.\n\nSince, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.\n\nNow, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).\n\nMedallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.\n\nNotice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.\n\nIn 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%\n\n**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.\n\nThat certainly beats inflation...\n\nSo, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?\n\n**PART 1: The Early Stages**\n\nEarly on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.\n\nRemember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,\u201d Simons said. \u201cA pure system without humans interfering.\u201d\n\nSimons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information\n\nStraus\u2019 was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.\n\nHe became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.\n\nOver time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.\n\nIn fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!\n\nAt the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.\n\nThe return in 2008 is a prime example of that.\n\nCommodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.\n\nThe fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.\n\n**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**\n\nNow in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the \"best math department in the world\".\n\nTherefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.\n\nWe are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.\n\nRenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.\n\nThe strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).\n\nSimons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.\n\nIn 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&amp;P 500 at an unusually low level.\n\nThis test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.\n\nIt had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.\n\nMagerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.\n\nFinally, the simulator\u2019s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.\n\nThe resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman\u2019s calculations.\n\nOnly then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....\n\n**PART 3: Infrastructure**\n\nNow I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.\n\nBig data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.\n\nThe problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:\n\nBuilding a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.\n\nTo then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.\n\nRenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.\n\nThey have completely automated the process of signal discovery:\n\nThey don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.\n\nRenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.\n\nThe data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.\n\nThe mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\n**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**\n\n**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**",

        "selftext": "I thought I was smart, I thought I had it all together, but evidently I didn\u2019t. I refused to jump in on SPCE because I was 100% sure it would go down yesterday; this was the RATIONAL decision to make. It was a speculative stock for a company with zero earnings, on a red Friday, BEFORE A THREE DAY WEEKEND, and it still shot up over 20%. I lost out on thousands of dollars because I sold my shares way to early and listened to the fucking bears. I have been bearish for a while, but after the past couple weeks, there is no point.\n\nThis is a retard\u2019s market. Logic and rational thinking gets you nowhere. A retard that YOLOs his life savings away will likely make more than someone who puts thought into their portfolio. I see that now. There\u2019s no point in thinking. I\u2019m still salty as fuck, if I had kept my calls I\u2019d be retired right now.\n\nBut I refuse to miss out any longer. I\u2019m trading in my claws for a set of horns.
