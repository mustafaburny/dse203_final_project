        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. \n\nHappy Independence day to all of you! S&amp;P 500 hit a new high (1.7% WoW increase) following Friday\u2019s strong job report (U.S. economy added 850,000 jobs, the most in 10 months). This marks S&amp;P 500 rise for the 7th straight day, the longest winning streak since last August. Even though the market had a strong rally, almost all the popular stocks took a significant beating in the past week.\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3q1rkh0my6971.png?width=1034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a33ca58866f42a1a9368919fd3e785ce5b96da4)\n\nThis is the first time where all the popular stocks except SPY ended in red the same week. This week's stock returns also illustrate the need for effective diversification of your portfolio!\n\nWISH continues to be the most discussed stock, but its sentiment took a significant beating following the 17% drop in the stock price in the past week (dropped to 4% from 46%). The best performing stock on the list was BlackBerry which almost recovered all its losses following the company\u2019s earnings report. A newcomer to the top 10 list is Virgin Galactic following the announcement that its next spaceflight test will carry founder Sir Richard Branson.\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3aliegymy6971.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02872056dc3f6f07f18357a616698dae9429ec56)\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**Micron Technology($MU):** MU released its [Q3 quarter results](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-technology-inc-reports-results-third-quarter-fiscal-2021) on June 30th, beating both revenue and EPS estimates. Even though the company had strong quarterly results, the stock tumbled 5% following the earnings due to raising capital expenditure forecast. Investors believe that this is just a minor blip as the company has reported impressive revenue growth of 36% (YoY) and a gross margin of 42% and MU can expect strong demand from the data center, PC and graphics, mobile markets.\n\n**Virgin Galactic($SPCE):** SPCE had a wild week with the stock jumping 23% on Friday after the company announced that its next spaceflight test will carry Richard Branson. The launch is expected to take place on July 11th and marks an attempt to beat Jeff Bezos after he announced that his company (Blue Origin) will have its first passenger spaceflight on July 20th. SPCE stock, in general, had wild swings this year with the stock climbing above $60 in February and then falling as low as $15 in May.\n\n**Vuzix Corp($VUZI):** VUZI is considered to be at the forefront of the wearable smart eyeglasses industry. The company was generating discussions as it gained almost 8% mid-week before dropping down. Investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock as reflected by its sentiment. The stock has experienced very large swings this year with it starting at $8 in Jan and rallying up to $30 in April before dropping down to its current level of $17. Still, the stock is up 109% YTD.\n\n**Paysafe($PSFE):** Paysafe is a payment platform that enables payment processing, digital wallet, and online cash solutions. The company is trending as it had recently announced its partnership with Microsoft and is now enabling online cash transactions on Microsoft Store. Adding to this, the company also announced an expanded partnership with FOX Bet.\n\n**NIO Inc($NIO):** Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer NIO has now climbed more than 20% in the last month. This strong rally is generating more discussions about the stock. In addition to this, analysts\u2019 recommendation has also become more bullish for the stock with Citigroup\u2018s Jeff Chung issuing a price target of $72 from the current $50 level. This is predominantly driven by the company\u2019s excellent shipment volume, with NIO confirming they have delivered 8,000+ vehicles in June and 21,896 vehicles for the entire second quarter.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:** ZIM Integrated Shipping($ZIM) got a boost in mentions following [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oakw8w/zim_pirates_of_the_zimmabean_dead_mans_dd/) excellent Due Diligence that was posted on wallstreetbets which showcased the company is a good long-term play. Intellia Therapeutics($NTLA) was also trending following their announcement that they have successfully corrected a hereditary disease ATTR amyloidosis, with a single infusion of CRISPR, a programmable gene-editing tool. The stock jumped 50% on the news but dropped down to a 15% gain over the last week.\n\nThank you for reading and hope you enjoyed this week's analysis! \n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*",

        "selftext": "Part of me has never been more confident in the future of the semiconductors. At the same time I am worried Wall Street will be unimpressed with future earnings. A company can make a bazillion dollars in profit but if they say one bad thing then Wall Street throws a fit. \n\nRegardless of what Wall Street thinks, the future of technology is dependent on semiconductor chips. \n\nFor example Micron (MU). I thought their earnings call was very positive. They had a huge beat on earnings and it sounds like their future is very bright. The CEO made is clear that as cloud storage and EV vehicle usage increase in the coming years it will be very beneficial to Micron. The future of technology relies on cloud storage and the future of transportation is electric and computerized. Its concerning that MU went down over 5% on heavy volume today. Sure looks like a heavy resistance. \n\nThen you have Nvidia (NVDA). Arguably the industry leader and growing like crazy. They are still waiting on approval on the Arm deal which I would expect to go through. It recently brokeout HUGE. I mean what? Up 21% in one month for a company that size? Thats unreal. \n\nAMD just recently broke its trading range and on its way to 100. I am concerned that volume was not as big as it was when it broke through but the catalyst of the Xlyinx deal going through should be enough? Its apparent AMD is beating Intel in their sub-sector and Intel is over 100 billion large in market cap. Will AMD be able to continue the breakout? I dont know why they wont be able to. \n\nTSM has been consolidating for awhile. I cant see any reason it would break to the down side except for a hostile take over of Taiwan by China. Then either its game on between China or the US or the US backs down like they probably will cause, I mean it would be bad business for Apple, Starbucks, Tesla, Costco, and other American companies trying to grow in China. \n\nHow are all of you approaching this situation? If youre not thinking about this industry as a 6 month to 1 year play then idk what I am doing. I got call options on AMD and Mu expiring in October and December and a few in March of next year.",

        "selftext": "Hello guys! So I developed a program to track growth in reddit mentions regarding stocks. The tool scraps all the posts in various subreddits and tracks down what stocks the posts are mentioning.\n\nPlease note that this post contains stocks that are growing in mentions compared to the previous week, not meaning that these are the top mentioned stocks this week. Also, keep in mind that the tool tracks multiple subreddits. \n\nThis week the following stocks got a significant growth in mentions: $SOFI, $AMD, $SPCE, $COIN, $MU.\n\nRegarding $SOFI, there was a big jump in mentions in the middle of the week, which was correlated with a 4% increase in the stock price, but since then mentions and price are down. The sentiment was overall positive, going down 32% saturday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fi7ho6tek8971.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b7d58881cb8a09af1c87c2457a2a85116e01c58\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gr4o6pkfk8971.png?width=1577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0df53b75bef1cda1cad380c7ea84d2ab35ccc88\n\nRegarding $AMD,  the 7-Day average is up 74%, with a growing conversation until thursday, going down since then. The sentiment is however, very positive around this stock.\n\nThe stock price accompanied the mention growth, stabilizing when the conversation cooled down.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhcsbcdkk8971.png?width=1737&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=425d4c0956cec9290d9a39bc6821c2c6036ecbb4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yonq68j1l8971.png?width=1568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7ba6f7b4e8a9f3c61be5a17c051a8692e661c76\n\n$SPCE also saw some decent conversation this week, following last week's growth in the end. The sentiment for yesterday is 50% ( = null) since there was no posts about ir. For the remaining of the week there was a decent growth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0663z6e6l8971.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947670f9998345fcdc06008f1a02576f43a7c9dc\n\n$COIN is also growing in mentions, with the sentiment around the stock being variable along the week, but growing in the past 3 days. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tozrdtahl8971.png?width=1726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=636eb5e0ead69ce5d27ce86186866d4538cb5bf6\n\nFinally, but not the least, a big growth in conversation around $MU, with over 300% growth compared with last week. The sentiment, in average is also quite positive. This happened following a 10% rally by MU until Thursday, falling down to a 4% rally wow at the end.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vews8ynml8971.png?width=1731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4012322e03a991a064a0ba4abd1f78f6d22210d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you enjoyed these graphs guys.

        "selftext": "(**TSXV: NBM**) (**OTC: NBMFF**)\n\nNeo Battery Materials have announced that, in the latest test, NEO's silicon nanocoating technology has successfully achieved to demonstrate effectiveness on low-cost, metallurgical grade silicon particles of micron-size (D50: 2.9\u03bcm), enabling a 6-minute (10 C-Rate) charge/discharge level without major capacity loss in the cell. The additional capability to exhibit substantial performance effectiveness with metallurgical grade, micron-sized (\u03bcm) Si particles is a step-change for NEO due to the significant cost reductions from the Si microparticle range and the flexibility of applying NEO's technology onto various Si particle sizes. \n\nDue to more efficient process times and lean, inexpensive manufacturing environments, metallurgical-grade Si microparticles are highly cost-effective compared to Si nanoparticles, but performance issues at the microparticle level have hindered the widespread adoption.\n\n\"NEO is hence targeting on a two-track to develop and refine its technology on both Si microparticles and nanoparticles. The results shown in this test emphasize the potency of NEO's Si nanocoating technology that can be applied to silicon with various particle sizes. Our technology's flexibility of application, performance and price competitiveness serves as the most crucial value propositions,\" commented Spencer Huh, President and CEO of NEO.\n\nI feel like every update I hear from Neo is great news like this!\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/finding-neos-silicon-technology-demonstrates-130000763.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/finding-neos-silicon-technology-demonstrates-130000763.html)\n\nDo your own research too, this is not investment advice!",

STOP DOING IT. \n\nSo anyway on to the report:\n\n[https://investors.micron.com/static-files/a62938c1-846b-40e2-b0dc-d5e921c16c7e](https://investors.micron.com/static-files/a62938c1-846b-40e2-b0dc-d5e921c16c7e)\n\n \u25aa Expect CY-21 DRAM industry bit demand growth to be somewhat above 20%, with DRAM industry supply below demand; there is currently unmet demand for DRAM due to end market strength and we expect the DRAM market to remain tight into CY-22 \n\n\u25aa Expect CY-21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the mid 30% range, with NAND supply below demand; we also see the NAND market as tight into CY-22 \n\n\u25aa Long-term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens \n\n\u25aa Long-term NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30% Micron \n\n\u25aa Targeting to align our long-term bit supply growth CAGR with the industry bit demand growth CAGR across DRAM and NAND \n\n\u25aa CY-21 DRAM and NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth \n\n\u25aa Placed orders for multiple EUV tools from ASML as part of long-term agreement \n\n\u25aa FY21 Capex revised to somewhat above $9.5 bn; mostly from areas that don\u2019t impact CY21 and CY22 bit growth such as EUV pre-payments, construction spending and other R&amp;D and corporate items \n\nNow during the call, analysts seemed to really dig in deep into Sanjays comments re purchasers shifting from \"just in time\" models to \"just in case\" models. They think this indicates previous purchases were above actual consumption and intended to raise inventory. As such they expect weakening demand and pricing moving forward. \n\nI disagree with their fears. Sanjay guides in a way so that he can smash at ER. He has done this for Micron and he has done with Sandisk before they got bought out at WDC. Have a look at previous earnings and whether they beat or not. \n\nexpand table to see more dates on links below\n\n[https://www.streetinsider.com/ec\\_earnings.php?q=sndk](https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?q=sndk) (Sanjay for all of it)\n\n[https://www.streetinsider.com/ec\\_earnings.php?sort=earning\\_date&amp;q=mu](https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?sort=earning_date&amp;q=mu) (Sanjay from Q3 2017)\n\nSanjay knows markets dont like surprise, so he guides low. Hes also been in Semi industry forever. Hes not an idiot. So when he says guidance is X, I take guidance to be X + extra for the beat. I dont freaking think I need to discount the guidance because purchasers increasing inventory. Sanjay has priced that shit in. \n\nSo thats inventory and guidance. \n\nWhat about the sale to Texas Instruments? Thats not linked to RAM or NAND really. Kinda but not really. Thats them giving up on (3dx point) Intel Octane. There was no market for it so keeping the plant was costing them 500 mil a year since it was under-utilised. However they kept all the IP from Octane in case it comes back to life later on. Its basically non volatile RAM which can be used as storage - sounds really cool but  I am guessing its expensive AF so people dont want it yet. Again, selling this plant is basically good for micron. We want higher margins to run a slick operation. \n\nI dont really like toms hardware but this article explains the sale the best. Other news stories on it say there was a sale but doesnt really tell you much about about the background.\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million)\n\nWhat is driving increasing margin? Well Micron is using DUV (deep ultra violet) with computational lithography and multiple masks to achieve smaller resolution on DRAM. Samsung are achieving same resolution with EUV. EUV costs a bunch and ASML are the only supplier. You should probably get into ASML at some point as well WSB but thats a post for another day. As such, Microns margins for latest tech DRAM is way lower than Samsung. SK Hynix is the third player in RAM and they are playing catchup - seem a bit fucked to me personally. Nanya is the 4th player and realllllly small and think they are just screwed. Dont have the money to get into EUV so next few generations, they will be so far behind they just get bought out if any competition regulatory body allows it (at near bankruptcy stage is my guess). \n\nNow Micron is starting to invest in EUV which is good and they have given themselves a lead time for 2 years which feels about right to me. In 2023 we will see if they are still at cutting edge of RAM vs Samsung who will have a 2 year head start into EUV production. This is the only concern to me. In this time, they will gain the benefit of reduced pricing for EUV tech and additional expertise from ASML who will be helping Micron to achieve results. I am hoping they can transplant their specialist know how from DUV to EUV (that everyone else didnt manage to do at this resolution), but at this stage, my science ability is woefully unable to track it meaningfully.\n\nLets look at Microns plan for EUV and the interim releases until then.  \n\n[https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/)\n\nSo you can see we are currently at 1 alpha node for 10nm in 2021. We have 1 beta and 1 gamma to go planned (still using DUV) before 1 delta which is when EUV should kick in. Thats a new node every year still using DUV. Thats sweet if it works out. In the interim Micron gets to print money like nobodys business (higher margin from DUV) and continue hiring R&amp;D people with EUV knowledge from Korea and Japan. \n\nI have a small long position in micron. I dont really care about short term price movements. I expect this to be higher in 3 to 6 months. Thats what I care about. I expect it to be higher in 12 months. Beyond that I want to see how their 1 beta and 1 gamma nodes are coming along with updates as to 1 delta using EUV. \n\nWe are trading at price levels from Jan/Feb this year. We have had 2 great ERs since then. I dont see TAM in RAM or NAND dropping any time soon or pricing (thesis of tacit collusion as to supply/pricing in oligopolies - we arent cyclical market anymore because 3 market players control like 98% of the DRAM production in the world - its why they are not dumping on capex - its intentional). \n\nthis is good price to buy, but dont expect results in a week or even a month. We might trade sideways for a while. Shake out the paper hands before funds buy back in at discount and ramp up for next ER. You cant time the ramp up, you just have to be in the stock at a decent price (like now) and then wait for it to happen.",

        "selftext": "I was holding call positions on $MU through May-June like a good ape \ud83e\udd8d. Here\u2019s why I switched to puts.  \n  \nDRAM won\u2019t be in short supply for long and smart money knows it. This means the prices for DRAM (which make up 70% of $MU\u2019s revenue) aren\u2019t going to continue increasing. \nIn fact\u2026 they\u2019ll likely peak October then start dropping.  \n  \n**Reason #1:**  \nNow my fellow apes may ask\u2026 \u201cbut peaceinpieces, Bloomberg articles tell me semiconductors are in a huge shortage\u201d. \nSure that\u2019s true as blanket statement, but let\u2019s peal the eggplant \ud83c\udf46 shall we?   \n  \nWhat\u2019s holding up the production of PC, Mobile handset, and servers isn\u2019t DRAM!\nThey\u2019re short on everything else: semiconductors like display, analog power ICs, CPUs, Networking chips, etc.  \n  \nIn fact many large customers have surplus DRAM (most notably mobile phone makers).\nWhy? Because they\u2019ve been buying DRAM while unable to get ahold of other necessary components.  \n  \n**Reason #2**  \nIndustry experts already knew earnings were going to be great. It\u2019s been priced in since May.  \n  \nWhat they were looking for in the earnings call was for Micron to swing their big dick onto the table and proclaim: \u201cDRAMs short in 2022 retards! We\u2019re going to the moon \ud83d\ude80\u201d.  \n  \nInstead they got lukewarm piss: \u201cWe see DRAM ASPs increasing through 2H\u201d.  \nTo which most analysts thought, \u201cNo shit, holiday season bruh.\u201d  \nMicron showed no confidence.  \n  \n**TLDR: I spent my time typing, so go read you ape \ud83e\udd8d . This market insight is being provided as a public service.**  \n  \n**Side note, I\u2019m still long $WDC and holding my calls and adding more for October. Pending KIOXIA\u2019s IPO in Japan, $WDC is undervalued at $20B. **",

        "selftext": "The importance of artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) has increased manifold over the years and now, it has become an essential part of many technologies that we use on a regular basis. AI, along with its subset, machine learning (\u201cML\u201d), as well as other technologies that make use of AI, like the Internet of Things, are finding applications in various segments across the world.\n\nNotably, one of the major areas where AI is being used considerably is e-commerce. With the help of AI, companies are offering personalized recommendations to their customers on their e-commerce websites or mobile apps, by studying customers\u2019 behaviors, including buying patterns, search histories, and so on. This is beneficial for companies because AI is able to suggest products that the customers are more likely to buy.\n\nMeanwhile, video streaming platforms have a plethora of content, sometimes making it difficult for consumers to find what they want to watch. This is where AI comes in as it offers streamlined recommendations to users which are more likely to be suited to their tastes. Meanwhile, AI is also powering digital voice assistants. Voice assistants make use of technologies like natural language processing to respond to users\u2019 commands or requests and with the help of ML, they are able to study the users\u2019 patterns and develop better responses over time.\n\nMoreover, AI is the driving force behind industrial automation. With the help of AI-powered robots, factories are automating mundane tasks, increasing operational efficiency, and improving output. Interestingly, AI is also finding its use in the development of self-driven cars. These cars make use of AI, sensors, cameras, and other technologies, to understand the environment around them and drive on the designated path, being mindful of traffic jams and other obstacles, and ensuring the safety of passengers.\n\nAI is also being used in the healthcare segment in areas like robotic surgeries. Notably, with the help of AI, robots are increasing the efficiency and precision of surgeries. In fact, a WhatNext Global article cited that research has shown that AI-assisted robotic procedures \u201ccould result in almost five times lesser complications than surgeons operating traditionally.\u201d Moreover, AI has been instrumental in the fight against COVID-19 as it has helped in areas like contact tracing, among others.\n\nOwing to the positive developments that AI is bringing to various segments, it is no surprise that the AI market is expected to grow going forward. Notably, Markets and Markets stated in a report that the global AI market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 39.7% from 2021 to 2026.\n\n### 4 Stocks to Watch Out For\n\nThanks to the myriad benefits that AI is offering across segments, it is only prudent to predict that the AI market will grow in the future. Hence, this seems like an opportune moment to keep an eye on companies that stand to benefit from this continued upswing in the use of AI. Notably, we have selected four such companies that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see **the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here**.\n\n**NVIDIA Corporation**\u2019s NVDA Compute and Networking segment offers Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 17.3% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 59%.\n\n**Micron Technology, Inc.**\u2019s MU high-capacity memory and multi-chip packages help in powering AI training and inference engines, whether in cloud, or embedded in mobile and edge devices. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 2.4% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 98.9%.\n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.** AMZN offers Alexa, its AI-enabled voice assistant. Moreover, the company\u2019s Amazon Web Services offer AI Services that help in providing ready-made intelligence to applications and workflows. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 2.1% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 37.3%.\n\n**Alphabet Inc.**\u2019s GOOGL Google offers AI and ML products and solutions through its Google Cloud platform. Moreover, Google has its AI-enabled Google Assistant. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 0.2% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 52.6%.\n\n### Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-most-surging-demand-094909250.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-most-surging-demand-094909250.html)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 1, 2021**\n\nThe rally in stocks continued, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) once again recording fresh intraday highs in the first trading day of the third quarter. The Nasdaq (QQQ) closed roughly even, as the rally in technology stocks takes a breather. The Dow Jones (DIA), which lagged the other two major indexes for all of June, continued its recovery. \n\nMarket participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and the incoming June Jobs Report, which is expected to be released tomorrow. \n\nADP\u2019s June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected[.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html) This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. \n\nDuring the second quarter, the technology, communication, real estate, and energy sectors were the best performers, underscoring the rotation from \u201creopening\u201d and cyclical stocks that led the market higher earlier in the year back into technology and growth stocks. The rotation coincided with tempered fears, with the market rocketing higher after an initial 4% sell-off following the release of the April Consumer Price Index. It seems the market has now accepted Powell and other monetary official\u2019s narrative that current inflationary pressures are \u201ctransitory\u201d and due mostly to pandemic-induced disruptions.\n\nLooking ahead, market participants wait for the June Jobs Report and are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Robinhood filed its S-1 Prospectus, marking a significant step forward as the company prepares for an upcoming IPO using the ticker HOOD. According to the S-1, Robinhood has 17.7 million monthly active users, with nearly 50% of those being first-time investors. Total revenue grew 245% to $959 million between the end of December 2019 and December 2020. The company was profitable in 2020, improving from a loss in 2019, but lost $1.4 billion in the first three months of 2021 amid the Gamestop frenzy that happened earlier in the year. This will be very interesting to watch, I have my popcorn out and ready to see what unfolds. \n* Shares of donut-maker Krispy Kreme (DNUT) popped in today\u2019s IPO, with the stock rising roughly 23% after trading became open to the public.\n* U.S. manufacturing sector activity retreated more than expected in June, reaching the lowest level since January. The Institute for Supply Management's June purchasing managers' index, a monthly indicator of U.S. economic activity based on a survey of purchasing managers at more than 300 manufacturing firms, fell to 60.6. This came following a print of 61.2 in May, and came in below the 60.9 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data. As long as the number is over 50 though, it shows growth in the sector. \n* Facebook (FB) has teamed up with French video game maker Ubisoft Entertainment SA to bolster its cloud-gaming platform with popular titles such as \"Assassin's Creed\". In recent weeks competition for cloud-based gaming platforms between mega-cap tech stocks has intensified, with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN) all ramping up their efforts.\n* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) rose roughly 15% today, recovering after a disappointing IPO debut yesterday. \n* Megan Thee Stallion is following in the footsteps of fellow celebrity Miley Cyrus by partnering with financial payments company Square (SQ) Cash App to give away $1 million worth of stock to her fans, another sign the push for retail investors and education is going ever more mainstream.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* ConocoPhillips (COP) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "(**TSXV: NBM**) (**OTC: NBMFF**)\n\nNEO Battery Materials stock price has jumped up significantly over the past 2 weeks and I'm not surprised. I've been following these guys for a while and am super impressed by the work they are doing in the junior resources and EV industry. Even with the recent jump, it is still not to late to get in on NEO, and here's why.\n\nNEO's main goal is developing silicon nanocoating technology for anodes that are used in Lithium batteries. These batteries are used mainly in electric cars so finding any way to make these batteries more efficient, durable and cost-effective, is something that major car manufacturers are clamoring for. The demand for lithium batteries is also growing rapidly, just last week Justin Trudeau said that Canada is aiming to be fully electric by 2035. This industry and thus demand for products like NEO's is going to grow ridiculously over the next decade and onward.\n\nThe company is using their access to mining claims in B.C to supply all of the silicon for their research and eventually their product. What makes this so unique is that anodes are traditionally made from graphite. NEO along with several big players in the EV industry see Silicon as the future of improving lithium batteries as it checks all the aforementioned boxes, its cheaper, more durable, and more efficient. NEO's research team led by Dr. J. H. Park is hard at work to be at the forefront of silicon anode production, and NEO is constantly releasing extremely promising test results from their efforts.\n\nJust yesterday, NEO announced that in a test using micron-sized silicon particles, they were able to register a 6-minute cell charge time without any major capacity loss. The main reason for this testing is that prior to this NEO and other companies have been using nanoparticles that are larger and have more retention and therefore are significantly more expensive. However, with their improved micron-sized particles being so effective they have lowered the cost and gotten rid of a significant bottleneck in the manufacturing process.\n\nThis test along with several others announced recently is the reason why the stock has been popping off lately. Considering that this product is still 2-3 years away from commercialization, I definitely believe there is tons of room for this stock to grow and new investors haven't missed the \"wave\". In terms of NEO's near future, I would expect to hear more testing news along with possible news of government funding they have been pursuing from both the Canadian and Korean governments. \n\nHere's a link to another post I made about NEO, goes into more specifics of the testing: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/oe8osz/neo\\_battery\\_materials\\_announce\\_successful\\_testing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/oe8osz/neo_battery_materials_announce_successful_testing/)\n\nHope my information was helpful!\n\nDo your own DD on this too, this is not investment advice.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 1, 2021**\n\nThe rally in stocks continued, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) once again recording fresh intraday highs in the first trading day of the third quarter. The Nasdaq (QQQ) closed roughly even, as the rally in technology stocks takes a breather. The Dow Jones (DIA), which lagged the other two major indexes for all of June, continued its recovery. \n\nMarket participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and the incoming June Jobs Report, which is expected to be released tomorrow. \n\nADP\u2019s June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected[.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html) This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. \n\nDuring the second quarter, the technology, communication, real estate, and energy sectors were the best performers, underscoring the rotation from \u201creopening\u201d and cyclical stocks that led the market higher earlier in the year back into technology and growth stocks. The rotation coincided with tempered fears, with the market rocketing higher after an initial 4% sell-off following the release of the April Consumer Price Index. It seems the market has now accepted Powell and other monetary official\u2019s narrative that current inflationary pressures are \u201ctransitory\u201d and due mostly to pandemic-induced disruptions.\n\nLooking ahead, market participants wait for the June Jobs Report and are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Robinhood filed its S-1 Prospectus, marking a significant step forward as the company prepares for an upcoming IPO using the ticker HOOD. According to the S-1, Robinhood has 17.7 million monthly active users, with nearly 50% of those being first-time investors. Total revenue grew 245% to $959 million between the end of December 2019 and December 2020. The company was profitable in 2020, improving from a loss in 2019, but lost $1.4 billion in the first three months of 2021 amid the Gamestop frenzy that happened earlier in the year. This will be very interesting to watch, I have my popcorn out and ready to see what unfolds. \n* Shares of donut-maker Krispy Kreme (DNUT) popped in today\u2019s IPO, with the stock rising roughly 23% after trading became open to the public.\n* U.S. manufacturing sector activity retreated more than expected in June, reaching the lowest level since January. The Institute for Supply Management's June purchasing managers' index, a monthly indicator of U.S. economic activity based on a survey of purchasing managers at more than 300 manufacturing firms, fell to 60.6. This came following a print of 61.2 in May, and came in below the 60.9 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data. As long as the number is over 50 though, it shows growth in the sector. \n* Facebook (FB) has teamed up with French video game maker Ubisoft Entertainment SA to bolster its cloud-gaming platform with popular titles such as \"Assassin's Creed\". In recent weeks competition for cloud-based gaming platforms between mega-cap tech stocks has intensified, with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN) all ramping up their efforts.\n* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) rose roughly 15% today, recovering after a disappointing IPO debut yesterday. \n* Megan Thee Stallion is following in the footsteps of fellow celebrity Miley Cyrus by partnering with financial payments company Square (SQ) Cash App to give away $1 million worth of stock to her fans, another sign the push for retail investors and education is going ever more mainstream.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* ConocoPhillips (COP) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "Six fucking percent for a week of work.  That's what realtors want in this market.  3% for the buyer's agent, 3% for the seller's agent, and all they have to do is take some pictures and put that shit up on the internet.  It's galling.  You have a $500k house and want to sell it?  Well, not without paying $30k to some shithead with an MLS account!  And it only gets more galling the richer you get.  The transaction cost on buying and selling homes is just really, really fucking high when you use an agent.\n\nAnd Zillow knows this, and they know people are sick of paying realtors $3,000-$10,000 per hour to sell their homes.  \n\nToday, I just sold an investment property to Zillow.  They offered me the Zestimate (their own pricing model which is publicly available on their website), which is great because it's how I valued my house anyway.  People are always on Zillow looking to see what shit costs, and they just offered me what they said the house was worth. \n\nThey charged me about $10k in seller concessions to for repairs and shit, which is higher than you might pay normally, but this is directly in line with my own estimations for what I would have needed to do to sell the house.\n\nFinally, they charges .1%.  POINT ONE PERCENT as a transaction cost.  So at the end of the day, I got exactly the price I expected, I didn't have to deal with anybody's bullshit (buyers, agents, showings, cleanings, contractors, staging, pictures) and I basically did the whole thing online.\n\nTheir tech is also very good.  Smooth docusigning, good customer service, even remote/Zoom notary services.  \n\nThey are going to spruce this house up and then they are going to sell it on their own platform to another buyer.  Even if they don't make a profit, what they just did is FUCK TWO TO FOUR REALTORS out of their commissions.  \n\nIt's like Sony taking a loss on their hardware to get market share.  This is how Zillow is going to win.  It was easier and cheaper and I dont' feel slightly fucked.  But realtors are fucked.  I think Z has earnings on 8/5.  I'm thinking about an option play but I don't know.  My wife bought like 15k of their stock for a long term hold in her roth, so that's all we've got for now.  What do you think?",

        "selftext": "Alright you retards, I'm taking the initiative to clear the air. I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes, but I'm going to be straight up honest here.\n\nWe are not a team, this is not a cult, and this is not fucking collusion.\n\nGME, AMC, &amp; CLOV are three completely different plays. Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude.\n\n**GME** \\- Was being shorted because as per \"technicals\" it was a company that was going to shit (bankruptcy) if they didn't change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model aka E-Commerce and the like. Additionally, the biggest reason GME picked up is in late December/early January is because it had a ridiculous/unprecedented short interest of %140. Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur. The stock picked up, gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it's still the play to this day. Why? because the remaining \\~15-20% short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses, thus still considered a major play + the company making big changes to their board of directors, adding e-commerce and more etc.\n\n**AMC** \\- This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up. The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME. The SI% on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20%. This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy. It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in. AMC due to the retail investors \"Picking\" this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued $1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success (hopefully). When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table, is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company. Again, the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares. On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO's paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail. Now, the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses. Also, seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID-19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again, thus, making AMC still a very big play.\n\n**CLOV** \\- Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO. This had nothing to do with GME or AMC. The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO. The play for CLOV is that it's a Medicare Advantage Disruptor, and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub-segment that hasn't changed in ages. This stock has a large short interest, now probably greater then AMC and GME combined, low float, no debt, and has a very bright future for growth. It's also heavily invested by Alphabet (Google) and other major players. The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC, separate that from your minds.\n\nYes, Melvin Capital, Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC, but this has no relevance to CLOV. No one gives a fuck, a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV. That's it, simple as that.\n\nAll 3 of these stocks are completely different plays. Yes, a short squeeze and/or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock. But get this through your heads, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY! They are completely different in respect to each other.\n\nWSB is a casino, we're here to place bets and hope for the best. This is not a team sport, this is not a cult, and this is not collusion. \n\nIf you don't like a stock, then don't throw money at it. But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can't grasp that WSB is a casino and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC. (I'm not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole, most of you are chill af, just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker thats not GME or AMC).\n\nNow with this shit said, I'm a big supporter of all 3. But for fuck sakes they are not the same play, stop comparing the 3.\n\nDon't forget AMC dropped to $6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved. GME dropped to $40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved. \n\nEveryone needs to chill the fuck out, play your plays and keep it moving. Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they're not correlated at all.\n\nBB and NOK became \"Meme\" stocks because fundamentally, they were undervalued for what the company actually does and where they're positioning themselves for the future. \n\nPeople just need to stop comparing and having these debates. 3 stocks, 3 completely different plays, fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best, just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it's ridiculous.\n\nAlso, the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight. You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck? They're going to wait until inflation hits and fucks up the whole market. They're probably betting that once the market goes tits up, people bag holding these stocks will sell, why? Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills, mortgages/rent, their children etc, and with the cost of living, cost of commodities inflating due to inflation, I can easily see how they're going to hold onto there positions (shorting these stocks) until this occurs. They're banking that when shit goes tits up, the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs. (My personal opinion).\n\nSome plays on WSB are value plays, short squeeze plays, gamma squeeze plays, undervalued plays, oversold plays, etc the fucking list goes on.\n\nWSB is a god damn casino, so treat it as such. I wish you all the best and many tendies, regardless of what you're invested in. Downvote me to oblivion, idaf.\n\nCheers,",

I see no reason AMC and GME can hit highs one time and not again a second time. Why are we so certain June was the peak? Why not end of July or August? I'm sure these stocks have been shorted aggressively on the way down. \n\nAMC announced it wasn't increasing share count, meaning there's now a limited supply. \n\nWhen GME shot up in February, I had the biggest FOMO ever. I had weeks to add shares at a lower price and kept waiting for the right time. \n\nWSB is SILENT right now. No more daily discussions on AMC / GME. Could hear a pin drop. I want to bring back that magic and excitement. What's a few shares between friends.  \n\nJPow is still printing money. Inflation through the roof. Oil hitting 5 year highs. Stock market at all time highs. People starting to go out and about again. What's stopping a MEME rally? \n\nI think we've all gotten too focused on dozens of random stocks (newegg, clne, etc.) and we forgot about our blue chips, GME and AMC.

        "selftext": "And, to top it off, the CCP is now discussing scrapping the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure through which foreign investors have \"invested\" in Chinese companies. [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china\\_considers\\_closing\\_loophole\\_used\\_by\\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/)\n\n(For a primer on the VIE structure and the risks it poses to American and other foreign investors looking to invest in China, see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets\\_getting\\_infiltrated\\_by\\_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets_getting_infiltrated_by_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3) )\n\nWonder if American and other foreign investors will \\*finally\\* get the memo with Didi here. If the CCP wanted American and foreign investors to lose the maximum right out of the gate, they could not have timed this move any better. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose substantial risks to the company\u2019s operations or business. Is there any credible evidence to suggest Didi execs were completely unaware the app was at risk of an imminent shutdown when the company filed its 10-K?\n\nSomeone lied. It's either the CCP or Didi itself (which, let's be honest, is likely little more than an alter ego for the CCP anyways, given the usual governmental presence required on boards and the like).\n\nThis lack of reciprocity cannot continue. The US government cannot and should not let Chinese companies list here unless they meet the same disclosure requirements that American companies meet under the prevailing securities acts and implementing regulations. Foreign investors in China must have access to the Chinese courts to litigate securities fraud actions, just as happens here on the flipside in the US (recall that Huawei/CCP was able to judicially challenge the Trump Administration's proposed ban in American court).\n\nUnless and until that happens, the lesson is clear: stay away from Chinese offerings. The CCP shows once again it has absolutely no qualms about deceiving and pulling the rug on foreign investors. This is definitely part of a larger pattern of the CCP flexing on foreign investors (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip\\_jack/gi0cl58/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip_jack/gi0cl58/); [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla\\_gang\\_heavy\\_sigh\\_of\\_relief\\_dont\\_want\\_to\\_get/ghuxevt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla_gang_heavy_sigh_of_relief_dont_want_to_get/ghuxevt/)). The risk is just not worth it. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why\\_nio\\_will\\_be\\_the\\_next\\_apple\\_and\\_the\\_leader\\_of/h38v0qm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why_nio_will_be_the_next_apple_and_the_leader_of/h38v0qm/)\n\nINB4:\n\n1. Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. But more to the point, with respect to all of these, the US has securities fraud laws to protect investors here; if they've been injured, and lies or fraudulent statements were made, then the offending company can be haled into court to answer for it, \\*including\\* by foreigners who invested in them. Theranos, like Enron, has even spawned a criminal process in addition to the civil one.\n\nTell me: do you, as a foreigner, have the right to demand a judicial remedy in Chinese court against the CCP or a SOE for, e.g., fraudulently rugpulling the VIE structure? Do you, as a foreign investor, have the right to hale Luckin Coffee into Chinese court for securities fraud?\n\nThere is no reciprocity. And that's the nub of the problem. As a foreign investor in China, you will get burned, and \\*there is nothing you can do about it\\* (unlike foreign investors here in the US).\n\n2. Ohh, silly person, China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry. Recall the National Security Law and Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed. The CCP more likely envisions itself as Bruce Willis in this scene from Die Hard 4: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps) . Yes, it injures itself, but it weakens or takes out its foreign competition in the process. The CCP has shown time and again it's more concerned above all else with consolidating its power. It is better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.",

I don\u2019t need to hear for the millionth time that  \u201cGE is going to sell a bunch of electric ovens\u201d or that a China cold war is going to help defense stocks. Give me a thesis I haven\u2019t heard before if you\u2019re throwing out a blue chip.\n* Please don\u2019t throw out something like PLUG. Maybe it is out-of-favor with its recent beat-down but there are already a billion posts already on them. \n* No \tbio-tech please unless you actually have a bull/bear case for the \tscience.\n* Under-appreciated\tdoes not need to mean \u201clow-PE\u201d, I\u2019m looking for companies that are investing in the future and ideally doing something that provides value to society, not \u201coh gee, this private \tprison company is trading with a 14% dividend\u201d  (yes, CXW is a thing).\n\nWhat I want is something that is **currently not in favor** but has potential to do well on a 10 year time frame. Why 10 years? The idea of \u201cefficient market hypothesis\u201d is misunderstood. It\u2019s really \u201caverage weighted market participant\u201d, and guess what...every market participant is in the game for a different reason. Some folks are in it for the YOLO, some are just trying to keep up with inflation, and most (asset managers) are simply trying to earn a good end-of-year bonus. I don\u2019t have a chance in hell beating the market on **their time-frame**, but I think I have a good shot of beating it on **my time-frame** if I buy and hold solid companies with patience on my side.\n\nFundamental DD isn\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for, I assume the market has already priced that in. **Tell me what the market isn\u2019t pricing in**. Also give me the bear case. I\u2019ll start this off with the most eccentric stuff in my book...\n\n**Alleghany Corp (Y)**\n\nI just really love the management of this re-insurance company. They don\u2019t \u201cplay Warren Buffet\u201d and invest in the stock market. Instead they invest in private companies, with an eye towards durable moats...companies that can\u2019t easily lose their position to Amazon or foreign competitors. Investments include AFCO Steel LLC (steel erection) &amp; Jazware Toys (maker of Pokemon &amp; AEW action figures). This is the management team that had the foresight to buy a private **FUNERAL** company while the corona-virus epidemic was raging.\n\nBull: COVID &amp; severe weather (winter storm) losses really took it\u2019s toll on the industry. Alleghany and others took significant underwriting losses. I see this as a positive going forward, because demand and pricing-power on re-insurance is likely be in an uptrend for the foreseeable future especially as severe climate events become the norm.  \n\nBear: Climate change is a double-edged sword. More frequent severe weather is a good thing, because that improves demand/pricing-power...but the risk of massive black-swan event is always there.\n\n**Restaurant Brands International (QSR)**\n\nI nearly decided not to include this as they are a blue-chip, but mutual funds and asset managers HATE QSR. Their financials are uninspiring and generally they have a reputation on the street for \u201cnot being well-managed.\u201d My take is that management is playing the long game rather than focusing on keeping the analysts happy...\n\nBull: If you\u2019ve ever walked around Wall St., one thing is for certain...those managers have not eaten in one of those restaurants in years. Asset managers are in love with YUM Brands\u2019 margin expansion yet ignoring that their food quality is going down the tubes. Meanwhile QSR has been playing the opposite game, stepping up their quality in Burger King and Tim Horton\u2019s especially. The market is also under-appreciating the global expansion potential of Popeyes and Burger King. Indians love the veggie burger, and China loves fried chicken. Global expansion was put on hold due to corona-virus but is going to resume.\n\nBear: Tim Hortons. Their quality has vastly improved but brand-damage already took its toll, will take years to repair the reputation. Work-from-home conditions are going to hurt this line-of-business for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Freyr (FREY)**\n\nBull: Not just another lithium-ion SPAC. This one is out of Norway and even had a show of support from Erna Solberg (Norwegian prime minister). Energy is cheap there thanks to wind/hydro and  Freyr provides a rare opportunity for Norwegians to get a job at a promising upstart.\n\nBear: This is the biggest risk on my book. They are literally starting from scratch. No manufacturing capability expected for several years. They are currently hiring w/ the funds from their IPO. My main thesis is that Norwegians don\u2019t generally pull pump-and-dump schemes like in the US. This can grow big or go to $0 if mismanaged.\n\n**Ingridions (INGR)**\n\nBull:  While everyone is distracted with Beyond Meat, industry dinosaur INGR has been not-so-secretly pivoting towards plant protein manufacturing. Just recently they\u2019ve opened the first US plant that focuses exclusively on plant-based protein isolates and teaming with Clara Foods on egg protein alternatives. They\u2019re plant-protein investments are expected to continue accelerating with nearly $200 million in investments planned.\n\nBear: High-fructose corn syrup. While the company has been diversifying their portfolio to include stevia, starches, and beer brewing ingredients, HFCS is still a major part of their business, and it continues to get a bad rep despite that Ingridion\u2019s corn syrup is likely more environmentally sustainable than cane sugar. Ingridion has not been able to win the perception war on HFCS and will need to keep finding new revenue streams to make up for stale demand in sweeteners.\n\n**NiSource, Inc (NI)**\n\nBull: Renewable energy investments are their biggest growth driver. While green energy eyes are focusing on cars, folks don\u2019t realize **utility** **workers** are going to be the muscle behind the energy revolution. I\u2019m looking towards a near-future where the political atmosphere recognizes this and accordingly green-lights the investments that are going to need to be made.\n\nTheir business model is also very resilient...this is a company that literally blew up 80 homes in Massachusetts, survived the lawsuit and ended with a stronger all-time high a year later. Currently trading (along many other utilities) at way below their pre-corona highs despite a near record-high spread between their dividend and treasury yield.\n\nBear: It\u2019s a regulated utility company. Political constraints are going to cap their upward potential.\n\n**IAMGold (IAG)**\n\nBull: Their stock has been beaten down after something like eight years of red tape, and now they\u2019ve finally broken ground on their Cote Mine in Quebec. I had to pay attention because Justin Trudeau himself attending the ground-breaking ceremony. Company has practically zero debt and a price to book of around 0.6. They are literally worth more than the gold they are sitting on. I don\u2019t think gold bugs realize the benefit of having a mine in Canada. If gold ever does reach $3000, good luck getting it out of a 3rd world country without paying bribes.\n\nBear: This company needs a strong gold price. Canadian labor is expensive: gold needs to fetch a good price to make mining profitable. A lot is riding on Cote and there\u2019s always the risk it could end up a bust.\n\n**Cal Maine Foods (CALM)**\n\nBull: Eggs are currently selling at near inflation adjusted lows (measured over 30+ years). It\u2019s practically never been cheaper to eat eggs, while per-capita consumption is on uptrend. Sooner or later the hope is that margins will improve, especially as demand for cage free increases. Cal-Maine is currently trading with a depressed price yet very high PE due to continued investment in growth, especially cage-free (these sell at larger margins). I see this as an investment that will pay off in 5+ years.\n\nBear: Literally all you need to compete with them is to buy a rooster and some hens. Egg industry pricing power remains weak.\n\n**Graftech (EAF)**\n\nI\u2019m usually not into very cheap but this company is very cheap. 7 PE. EAF is a Brookfield turnaround story. It\u2019s understood that they were mismanaged before Brookfield came in, cleaned things up, and improved efficiency/margins. Stock has been a bear since Brookfield IPO\u2019d it, as it\u2019s obvious the purpose of the IPO is just so that Brookfield could cash in on their original investment. BIG insider selling by Brookfield has not finished yet and it remains an anchor around the stock price. Fortunately however Brookfield has already trimmed down to own &lt; 25% of the company...so there\u2019s a bit more to go but the insider selling drag is likely to be over soon.\n\nBull: The steel industry is responsible for roughly 5% of all global carbon emissions. There\u2019s currently no other way to produce low-carbon steel other than recycling steel scrap. EAF is the largest US manufacturer of graphite electrodes: the heating element used in the furnace to melt down and recycle steel. Right now there isn\u2019t any political \u201cpush\u201d to increase recycled steel demand, and \u201cmade in USA\u201d has so far been an empty promise, but I expect real political push for both will come in a few years.\n\nBear: China. Industry speculation is that China is building up several times the capacity to build graphite electrodes...although speculation is also that quality will not be a good. It remains to be seen if Chinese firms are doing this for domestic consumption only (China wants to go green too). It also remains to be seen if Chinese output will be able to keep up with or exceed recycled steel demand.",

        "selftext": "Hello! I keep trying to explain to friends and family how if done right, you can minimise risk and maximise reward. I was explaining the S&amp;P 500 index fund and how it is the least risky type of investment, and how over time it has gained over 100 years 7-8% adjusted with inflation. Now I know there is a risk, but it makes my blood boil when they say it's gambling just like the casino because it ain't. They obviously don't know much about it. My question to you guys, how do you respond in a way to show them it's not and that it's bad stigma from day traders and culture that makes em think this way? How do I explain in the most layman terms to them that an index fund in the S&amp;P 500 is the least risky option when it comes to investing? Appreciate the support.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR - Short TF out of this or buy puts once available. A company riddled with a history of fraud, misleading investors, and deceitful accounting tactics is being dumped to the public by a large private equity firm.\n\nMy god, this is one of the most blatant cash outs I\u2019ve ever seen. CNBC was pumping this name all morning and interviewed their CEO who touted its new \u201cOmni channel\u201d strategy that will lead to better margins. My BS meter started going off so I decided to read their S-1 and see what was going on under the hood.\n\nKrispy Kreme used to be public in the 2000\u2019s and was acquired by JAB Holdings in 2016 for $1.35 billion following numerous scandals of channel stuffing and overstating revenues. Execs would pretty much order shipments of donuts to be sent to franchises and claim sales to meet quarterly estimates. Wild. There are other irregular accounting techniques used throughout the years along with bullying tactics used against franchise owners but you get the picture, won\u2019t go into detail.\n\nSo now after a few years of being private sprinkled with an acquisition (Insomnia Cookies), execs/JAB decided it was time to cash out.\n\nIn the presentation, Krispy Kreme emphasizes its strong revenue growth. This is a trap. Their organic growth is flat +1% at most when you strip out revenues from their debt heavy acquisition which is why their margins are just awful now and will not improve. It also excludes new shops that were recently opened because it does not matter if you are growing as a company if you can\u2019t achieve economies of scale. You see this a lot with companies who know they can\u2019t be profitable - emphasize revenue growth! \n\nKrispy Kreme shouldn\u2019t trade at more than 1x its revenue until it proves it can be profitable through some miraculous turnaround. At a $3 billion market cap currently, I forecast it is nearly 40% overvalued. This should be a $10 stock. Whoever the lead underwriter was for this IPO deserves a raise after pulling such a ridiculous multiple. I guess that\u2019s why companies go public when the market is at all-time highs.",

        "selftext": "[S&amp;P 500 rises for a 7th straight day after strong jobs report, best winning streak in 10 months (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/01/stock-market-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n&gt;Stocks rose on Friday and the S&amp;P 500 hit another record high after the June jobs report showed an accelerating recovery for the U.S. labor market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The broad market index rose 0.75% to 4,352.34, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.81% to notch its own record at 14,639.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 152.82 points to close at 34,786.35. The S&amp;P 500 has now risen for seven consecutive sessions, its longest winning streak since August.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Solid moves by major tech stocks helped support the overall market on Friday, with shares of Apple and Salesforce rising by nearly 2% and 1.3%, respectively. Microsoft jumped 2.2%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the week, the Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow climbed 1.7% and 1%, respectively. Several sectors closed at record levels on Friday, including tech and health care.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The strong week on Wall Street was spurred by a string of solid economic reports, capped by a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday morning.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The economy [added 850,000 jobs last month](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/jobs-report-june-2021.html), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting an addition of 706,000. The print topped the revised 583,000 jobs created in May.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThis is a strong report and should be taken as a sign of things to come for an accelerating labor market,\u201d Aberdeen Standard Investments deputy chief economist James McCann said in a note.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones, said that the report showed solid growth but wouldn\u2019t change the Fed\u2019s policy path, hitting a sweet spot for markets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think it was one of these goldilocks-type of reports, because hiring accelerated -- which is a positive sign for the second half and the recovery -- but not so much that it would trigger a reaction of an accelerated timeline for the Federal Reserve to start tapering,\u201d Kourkafas said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In addition to the job gains, average hourly wages rose 0.3% for the month and are up 3.6% year over year, matching expectations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said that the report eased concerns about a labor shortage.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think we also learned that the explanations for the weaker numbers from April and May -- namely that seasonal probably weighing on job growth and probably some impact from the unemployment benefits on labor supply -- that those were pretty good explanations. So I think it was reassuring, in that sense,\u201d Hatzius said on CNBC\u2019s \u201c[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/),\u201d adding that the unemployment rate coming in higher than expected showed that the recovery still had a long way to go.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The S&amp;P 500 has now risen in five of the past six weeks, while the Nasdaq has gained in six of the past seven weeks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even with the recent strength for stocks, market strategists say that uncertainty about the future of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases and the upcoming earnings season could keep stocks from making major gains in the near term.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe market is still very much concerned about the Fed\u2019s reaction function,\u201d said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, adding that he thought there was still a lot of slack in the labor market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One weak spot for the markets this week was small caps, as the Russell 2000 slipped 1% on Friday to finish negative for the week.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On Friday, shares of Boeing fell 1.3%, weighing on the Dow, after a 737 cargo plane made an [emergency landing off the coast of Honolulu](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/boeing-cargo-plane-makes-emergency-landing-in-ocean-off-honolulu-coast-faa-says.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1625234441).

        "selftext": " \n\nAh yes! Another DD on Gamestop and why wE'rE gOinG tO (banned phrase) tHiS wEeK bRo.\n\nActually not. Whether you believe in the (banned phrase) or not this DD applies to any smooth brained tendie dependent retard who wants to make a quick buck this week.\n\nI will layout some technical analysis for why I believe we are beginning our reversal out of the past weeks sell off and potential for a higher rally.\n\nThere are plenty technical DD's on the large cup and handle, a low AF RSI, MACD about to cross, the continuation of higher lows being built, and elaborate wave theory ANALysis' but that shit is too advanced for my wrinkle-less, crayon eating self.\n\nSo, today I got bored and pulled up the GME chart to jerk off just like any other Sunday, but I realized a very interesting pattern that has repeated itself 5 separate times over the past 12 months.\n\n**The pattern involves a 1-3 week sell off followed by a test of support (different support each time), a green candle followed by a doji star (very important), and then a rally of up to 300% (minimum 70%) into the next 2 weeks. (or faster!!)**\n\nHere are the 5 times this has happened and what support was contacted and what occurred as a result of this pattern.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**the red line is the 50 day moving average and the rally of 90% took 10 days!!!**\n\n[10\\/26\\/2020 - 11\\/30\\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/6h0agzdi3pa71.png?width=1073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96016ccc9bb48810d06cb9a9dd7f321588512be3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**once again the red line is the 50 day moving average and the rally of 70% took 6 days!!!**\n\n[12\\/8\\/2020 - 12\\/23\\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/7pg63gq44pa71.png?width=1017&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01dc80e260813e84c8d003f2d0a9d723f80ce67e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**for this one I used the close of the prior day at $100 even as my \"support\". 200%+ gain**\n\n[2\\/25\\/2021 - 3\\/9\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/rp0wi9t94pa71.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c98c24722621e2cdcd80a9d2eb1130b6b899336)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**now for this one our support was a trendline from February/March and the rally actually went all the way to $340. notice the support is always tested with a green candle followed by doji star.**\n\n[4\\/27\\/2021 - 5\\/26\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/h3os2n7d4pa71.png?width=2013&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15bc079ad8a3af1b0263a43c7a8a68b707a45a53)\n\n\"Wow! So cool! Why are you showing me this?\"\n\nI can already hear you retards asking why this pattern is significant and the reason is this is our current chart setup...\n\n**This support level was the 100 day moving average (white line; cocaine cramer is that you?) and we formed the EXACT SAME CANDLE COMBO.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u969xf4g4pa71.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=508cc76c9652b2c871630d6b151e3beb0bd55602\n\nFeel free to go back to the charts to confirm that what I am showing you is actually real.\n\nIt is up to you on how to capitalize on this situation but I recommend 80% shares and 20% FDs.\n\nPositions: 60 shares and 200c 7/16.\n\n**TLDR: GME has formed a candle combo off of support lines 5 times after sell offs. We just formed the same combo on THUR/FRI last week off of the 100 day moving average and my tits are cutting holes in my shirts they are so jacked!**",

        "selftext": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/11/science/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space.html?smid=url-share\n\nSPACEPORT AMERICA, N.M. \u2014 Soaring more than 50 miles into the hot, glaringly bright skies above New Mexico, Richard Branson at last fulfilled a dream that took decades to realize: He can now call himself an astronaut.\n\nOn Sunday morning, a small rocket plane operated by Virgin Galactic, which Mr. Branson founded in 2004, carried him and five other people to the edge of space and back.\n\nMore than an hour later, a Mr. Branson took the stage to celebrate. \u201cThe whole thing was magical,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Branson\u2019s flight reinforces the hopes of space enthusiasts that routine travel to the final frontier may soon be available to private citizens, not just the professional astronauts of NASA and other space agencies. Another billionaire with his own rocket company \u2014 Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon \u2014 has plans to make a similar jaunt to the edge of space in nine days.\n\nIn each case, billionaire entrepreneurs are risking injury or death to fulfill their childhood aspirations \u2014 and advance the goal of making human spaceflight unexceptional.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting their money where their mouth is, and they\u2019re putting their body where their money is,\u201d said Eric Anderson, chairman of Space Adventures Limited, a company that charters launches to orbit. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive, frankly.\u201d\n\nAt 8:40 a.m. Mountain time, a carrier aircraft, with the rocket plane, named V.S.S. Unity, tucked underneath, rose off the runway and headed to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and a few moments later, its rocket motor ignited, accelerating the space plane on an upward arc.\n\nAlthough Unity had made three previous trips to space, this was its first launch that resembled a full commercial flight of the sort that Virgin Galactic has promised to offer the general public, with two pilots \u2014 David Mackay and Michael Masucci \u2014 and four more crew members including Mr. Branson.\n\nThis flight resembled a party for Virgin Galactic and the nascent space tourism business. Guests included Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX; Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico; and about 60 customers who have paid for future Virgin Galactic flights.\n\nStephen Colbert of the CBS program \u201cThe Late Show\u201d introduced segments of the webcast that included some live video from inside the spaceship. After the landing, Khalid performed a new song.\n\nWhen the fuel was spent, Unity continued to coast upward to an altitude of 53.5 miles. The four people in back unbuckled and experienced about four minutes of floating before returning to their seats.\n\nMr. Branson was accompanied in the cabin by Beth Moses, the company\u2019s chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations.\n\nAs the space plane re-entered the atmosphere, the downward pull of gravity resumed. Unity glided to a landing back at the spaceport.\n\nFor well over a decade, Mr. Branson, the irreverent 70-year-old British billionaire who runs a galaxy of Virgin companies, has said he believes that commercial flights will soon begin. So did the 600 or so customers of Virgin Galactic who have paid $200,000 or more for their tickets to space and are still waiting. So did the taxpayers of New Mexico who paid $220 million to build Spaceport America, a futuristic vision in the middle of the desert, in order to attract Mr. Branson\u2019s company.\n\nAfter years and years of unmet promises, Virgin Galactic may begin flying the first paying passengers next year after two more test flights. But with tickets costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, this experience will, for now, remain out of financial reach for most people.\n\nFounding a space exploration company was perhaps an unsurprising step for Mr. Branson, who has made a career \u2014 and a fortune estimated at $6 billion \u2014 building flashy upstart businesses that he promotes with a showman\u2019s flair.\n\nWhat became his Virgin business empire began with a small record shop in central London in the 1970s before Mr. Branson parlayed it into Virgin Records, the home of acts like the Sex Pistols, Peter Gabriel and more. In 1984, he was a co-founder of what became Virgin Atlantic, to challenge British Airways.\n\nThe Virgin Group branched out into a mobile-phone service, a passenger railway and a line of hotels. Not all have performed flawlessly. Two of his airlines filed for insolvency during the pandemic last year, while few today remember his ventures into soft drinks, cosmetics or lingerie.\n\nThe spaceflight company was of a piece with Mr. Branson\u2019s penchant for highflying pursuits like skydiving and hot-air ballooning. And unlike many of the Virgin Group\u2019s businesses, Virgin Galactic has been a major focus of Mr. Branson\u2019s.\n\nVirgin Galactic joined the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 after merging with a publicly traded investment fund, giving it a potent source of new funds to compete with deep-pocket competitors \u2014 and publicity, with Mr. Branson marking its trading debut at the exchange in one of the company\u2019s flight suits.\n\nThe Virgin Group retains a 24 percent stake in Virgin Galactic.\n\nVirgin Galactic\u2019s space plane is a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 captured the $10 million Ansari X Prize as the first reusable crewed spacecraft built by a nongovernmental organization to make it to space twice in two weeks.\n\nMr. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin by 2007. But development of the larger craft, SpaceShipTwo, stretched out.\n\nThe first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, V.S.S. Enterprise, crashed during a test flight in 2014, killing one of the pilots. Virgin Galactic was then grounded until Unity was completed a year and a half later.\n\nIn 2019, Virgin Galactic came close to another catastrophe when a seal on a rear horizontal stabilizer ruptured because a new thermal protection film had been improperly installed.\nThe mishap was revealed this year in the book \u201cTest Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut\u201d by Nicholas Schmidle, a staff writer at The New Yorker. The book quotes Todd Ericson, then the vice president for safety and test at Virgin Galactic, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know how we didn\u2019t lose the vehicle and kill three people.\u201d\n\nMr. Bezos\u2019 flight is to take place about 200 miles to the southeast of Spaceport America in Van Horn, Texas, where his rocket company, Blue Origin, launches its New Shepard rocket and capsule.\n\nAlthough Blue Origin has yet to fly any people on New Shepard, 15 successful uncrewed tests of the fully automated system convinced the company it would be safe to put Mr. Bezos on the first flight with people aboard.\n\nHe will be joined by his brother, Mark, and Mary Wallace Funk, an 82-year-old pilot. In the 1960s, she was among a group of women who passed the same rigorous criteria that NASA used for selecting astronauts, but the space agency at the time had no interest in selecting women as astronauts. A fourth unnamed passenger paid $28 million in an auction for one of the seats.\n\nNeither Blue Origin nor Virgin Galactic flights go high enough or fast enough to enter orbit around Earth. Rather, these suborbital flights are more like giant roller coaster rides that allow passengers to float for a few minutes while admiring a view of Earth against the black backdrop of space.\n\nMr. Bezos\u2019 company emphasized the rivalry with Virgin Galactic for space tourism passengers in a tweet on Friday. Blue Origin highlighted differences between its New Shepard rocket and Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo including the fact that New Shepard flies higher, above the altitude of 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, that is often regarded as the boundary of space. However, the United States Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration set the boundary at 50 miles.\n\nThe company also noted the size of the New Shepard capsule\u2019s windows, and called Virgin Galactic\u2019s Unity \u201ca high-altitude plane\u201d in contrast to New Shepard\u2019s rocket.\nMr. Bezos on Sunday congratulated Mr. Branson and his fellow crew on their flight. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to join the club!\u201d he added in an Instagram post.\n\nBlue Origin has not yet announced a ticket price, and Virgin Galactic\u2019s earlier quoted fare of $250,000 may rise. But on Sunday after his trip, Mr. Branson announced a sweepstakes that will give away two seats on a future Virgin Galactic flight.\n\nJoy-riding tourists will not be the only passengers on future suborbital flights. Both companies are selling flights to organizations including the Italian Air Force where scientists will conduct experiments that take advantage of the minutes of microgravity.\n\nThe era of nonprofessional astronauts regularly heading to orbit may also begin in the coming year. Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire, is essentially chartering a rocket and spacecraft from SpaceX for a three-day trip to orbit that is scheduled for September.\n\nIn December, Space Adventures has arranged for a Japanese fashion entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, and Yozo Hirano, a production assistant, to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket on a 12-day mission that will go to the International Space Station.\n\nAnother company, Axiom Space in Houston, is arranging a separate trip to the space station that will launch as soon as January.\n\nThe orbital trips are too expensive for anyone except the superwealthy \u2014 Axiom\u2019s three customers are paying $55 million each \u2014 while suborbital flights might be affordable to those who are merely well off.\n\nBut how many people are willing to spend as much as some houses cost for a few minutes of space travel?\n\nCarissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm, thinks there will be plenty. \u201cBased on previous ticket sales, surveys and interviews,\u201d she said in an email, \u201cwe see strong demand signals for multiple hundreds of passengers a year at current prices, with potential for thousands if prices drop significantly.\u201d\n\nMr. Anderson of Space Adventures is less certain.\n\n\u201cPer minute, it\u2019s like a thousand times more expensive than an orbital flight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nTwo decades ago, Space Adventures did sell suborbital flights including a ticket to Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally. \u201cWally Funk was one of our first customers,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThat would have been like 1998.\u201d\n\nThe ticket price then was $98,000.\n\nAt one point, about 200 people signed up for suborbital flights, but none of the promised suborbital rocket companies was able to get their space planes close to flight. Space Adventures returned the money to Ms. Funk and the others.\n\nNow this unproven suborbital market has whittled down to a battle of billionaires \u2014 Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos.\n\n\u201cIf anybody can make money and make the market work for suborbital, it\u2019s Branson and Bezos,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThey have the reach and the cachet.\u201d",

        "selftext": "SOFI seems to have hit a bottom around $17.25 today... and with PIPE selling exhausted- is ready to move much higher. (and what little selling may occur from employees- is a drop in the ocean compared to retail buyers... considering SOFI has less than 1000 employees). \n\n\nCramer just included SoFI as 1 of the post merger SPACs to buy now. SOFI has all buy ratings from analysts- with an initial $30 price target.  SoFI also has one of the highest short float % at around 45% (which meaning many Millions of shares have to he bought to cover those short positions). \n\n\nAnd with a market cap under $14B, SOFI is extremely undervalued (consider Robinhood going public later this summer around $40B.. likely to be $60B after 1st day of trading).  Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future. But its a definite big winner either way.  Not to mention a 2 for 1 deal... as Galileo will be worth just as much as SOFI- and an option to spin off in the Future (similar to EBay &amp; Paypal)\n\n\n**Summary of SOFI Becoming a Fintech Behemoth**\n\nFintech is becoming the next big disruptor- and Sofi is being positioned to be the real leader in this category (and currently- the dinosaur banks have market caps of 300B, $450B, etc). Not only is SOFI the only internet bank with the full slate of financial products...\nthey also have Galileo for the platform/\nSoftware fintech play... just look at the top quality leadership team SOFI is attracting... Anthony Noto as CEO.. CFO came from Uber... person in charge of Galileo from Google,etc.\n\n\n**Overview of Business **\n\nSoFi acquisition of Golden Pacific will make it a\nnational bank, like JPMorgan Chase. This will\nallow SOFI to take direct deposits &amp; make\nloans based on those deposits, rather than\nacting as a re-seller.\n\nSofi also offers Credit Cards &amp; recently\nannounced it deal to offer auto loans. Also,\ntheres SoFi brokerage, which competes with\nRobinhood.\n\nThen add to the mix, Galileo, a payments\nprocessor (ie Stripe, Square ) it bought for\n$1.2B. Galileo dominates the Banking-as-a-\nService (BaaS) ecosystem. Galileo offers\nbanking platform for over 90% of all digital\nbanks in North America. Over 70% of Top100\nFintechs globally are clients- including Chime\nand Robinhood.",

        "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nLet me just preface this by saying this post is for those who take trading seriously, who harbor real hopes of earning a steady income in the market. This post is going to be long, and it is going to demand work from you to both understand and attempt to emulate. But that work will be worth the effort. I recommend you read it several times through, and keep as a reference. If you are just here looking for entertainment and gambling, that is fine, but this is probably a thread to skip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFour weeks ago I began a challenge to turn $4k into $1M. I began this to help educate others on the professional trading process, and to prove several points that are often in contention:\n\n**1) That it can be done,** \n\n**2) That good trading is actually simple,** \n\n**3) That technical analysis is real and effective,**\n\n**4) That small accounts have a huge edge.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here are my results from the FIRST WEEK of that challenge.**\n\n*Processing img 92wrzgrcasb71...*\n\n**Return first week: $658 (+16.5%)**\n\nThe question you should be asking yourself is: **How did I find so many sudden, big winners in a single week?** I will teach you exactly how below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, let's just get a bit of a rant off my chest. Hard words to follow, and a lot of you will disagree with these points, but some of you will benefit a lot from hearing it. These are some of the reasons you aren't making money, in my not so humble opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1) Stop chasing stupid memes and \"hot\" stocks. Create your own opportunities.**\n\nWhen I read the daily chat in subs, including this one, it gets really depressing quick. All I see are the same tickers posted over and over and over again, and usually total dogshit stocks. Everyone just copying what others tell them to trade, so few actually thinking for themselves or finding their own trades and opportunities. Like, why is half this sub bagholding SOFI and mentioning it nonstop? Was some recent DD posted on it and you all just hopped in blindly? Why the obsession with the other same tickers, like CLNE, that get posted again and again? Because others were posting about it? Look, I won't deny you can sometimes, potentially make money in meme stocks or reading DDs. But chasing memes or pump and dumps is not going to make you money long term.\n\nMaybe you looked at the fundamentals and you thought it was a great company with long term prospects. Ok, sure. But if you are trading on fundamentals, why the hell are you buying short term options? If you are a fundamental trader then you are a buy and hold investor with a year plus timeline. If you are buying weeklies or looking for a quick pop, fundamentals don't mean shit, technicals are what matter. Stop mixing long term strategy with short term trading, it just doesn't make any sense.\n\nSet up your own scanners. Do your own research. Find your own opportunities.\n\n**2) Stop trading slow as fuck megacap stocks with a small account.**\n\nWhen I see people with sub-million dollar accounts trading stocks like Ford or even Apple, I can't help but cringe. The one HUGE advantage that small accounts have is that they can trade the fast, explosive, hard moving small cap stocks without having to worry about issues like liquidity and wicking the price upward. *The reason you can beat the market hard with a small account is because you can trade the highest beta stocks that guys like Buffett can't.* But only if you focus on them.\n\nTrade the fast stocks. The stocks that really move hard. Those are the stocks that will get you rich quickly, not fucking BABA on a 2% move.\n\nThere is an acronym you need to learn, and become obsessive about. That acronym is ADR. Average Daily Range. If your account is less than a million, you should not even be looking at stocks with an ADR less than 5%. They are too slow. When someone asks me to judge a stock or setup for them, the very first thing I look at is the ADR. If it is less than 4 or 5 ADR, I tell them it is dog shit, whether I'm bullish on it or not.\n\nAAPL has an ADR of 1.6 at the moment. Garbage stock for small accounts. Is it rallying? Sure. It is rallying in 1.6% increments. Can you make money in that? Sure, even more with options. But you won't double your account in a month with Apple unless you YOLO everything into short dated options. It works until you go broke, which let's be honest, most people here have or will.\n\nTSLA has an ADR of 3.5. Not terrible, but you can do much better.\n\nSPCE has an ADR of 12.5. THAT is what you want to see. I made a 42% return on SPCE in 3 days last week, with SHARES. And I will show you exactly why I bought SPCE and many others before they exploded last week. It wasn't simple luck.\n\n**3) If you want to gamble with options, then go for it. But if you want to be an actual professional trader, you probably shouldn't touch options until you've shown consistency with shares first.**\n\nLook, if you just want to gamble and hope to get lucky, knowing you will probably go broke, that's fine with me. That's the WSB way. At least you are being honest with yourself. But if you want to get serious about trading, to make so much money so consistently you never have to work again, you should not be touching options until you've proven you can be consistently profitable trading shares.\n\nLeverage and margin is something that ought to be earned, not used just because it is there.\n\nOptions are extremely unforgiving. Let's say you buy a stock at 10, it rallies up to 12, then tanks back to 10 again, and you sell. With shares, you've just broken even. Not good, but obviously not bad either. Breakeven is fine for a trade. But do the same exact trade with options instead of shares, and you could be down 20% on it. Good luck overcoming that downward pressure as a noobie trader long term. Trading is hard enough without adding theta and vega rape to the mix.\n\n**4) If you want to be a professional, then think and act like a professional.**\n\nProfessional traders are process oriented. They are focused on improving their trading process more than they are on chasing the hot next trade.\n\nThat means having a method or system to your trading. Something you can repeat again, and again, and gradually improve. It means using scanners and finding YOUR OWN stocks and trades, finding tickers neither you nor most anyone else has even heard of before, and making tons of money on them. Browsing WSB for DD or the next hot stock is not a system, and likely won't lead to any lasting success as a trader.\n\nIt also means you have to work fucking hard. Success is rarely easy, much less in something as competitive as the stock market. If you are lazy, or don't want it enough, be honest with yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now, on to making money.**\n\nWhat follows is one simple setup that will make you money if traded correctly. I will teach you a process you can follow and repeat and improve upon. This obviously isn't the only way to trade, but I can promise you it beats the market significantly if done correctly. So learn it, and practice it, and start making money. From there, the rest is improvement, and branching out, and finding new strategies to test and perfect on your way to becoming an independent, professional trader. In other words, the rest is gravy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Breakout Swing Trading Strategy: The Setup.\n\n*Processing img 0nnm1qztasb71...*\n\nThis is a purely technical trading system. A lot of people will tell you technical analysis is nonsense and doesn't work. Those people do not know what they are talking about. I've made my living as a purely technical trader, and I assure you I am not the only one. Over my career I've picked far too many huge short term winners using nothing but charts for it to be simple luck.\n\nTo put it in one sentence: **We are going to look for strong, volatile momentum stocks that are breaking out of a consolidation pattern.**\n\nSounds easy, and it is, but the details are what really matter. So let's go in depth.\n\nWe will start by analyzing five of the trades I've made as part of my $1M challenge, so you can see exactly what I saw on the charts when I entered my positions. I drew two red lines on each chart to show the \"flagging\" pattern I was watching. The chart on the left is daily candles, chart on the right is hourly candles. Proof of these entries and exits can be found in both text and screenshot format in my history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Example #1: IDT**\n\nBought @ 37.70 on 7/1\n\nSold partial @ 47.00 on 7/2\n\nReturn: 25% gain in 1 day\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dxwixuarbsb71.png?width=1619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=403e77830fe05e1e0d8c38f76cb2098656af8abf\n\n**Example #2: SPCE**\n\nBought @ 37.25 on 6/22\n\nSold partial @ 52.8 on 6/25\n\nReturn: 42% gain in 3 days\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvlqevnsbsb71.png?width=1619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4f7d04aafb25e4a43700eb223b3b011f6fd652d\n\n**Example #3: \\[redacted small cap\\]**\n\nBought @ 3.81 on 6/24\n\nSold partial @ 4.44 on 6/25\n\nReturn: 17% gain in 1 day\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23rk1b4ubsb71.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cb4eb4f83154b4d992cc6b6b3bc882e60d0ea43\n\n**Example #4: LPI**\n\nBought @ 68.86 on 6/21\n\nSold partial @ 91.39 on 6/25\n\nReturn: 33% gain in 4 days\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jiiuwlevbsb71.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa4d81b417b665324f1fca54f18995f361bfe5d5\n\n**Example #5: CRCT**\n\nBought @ 35.74 on 6/25\n\nSold partial @ 41.85 on 6/28\n\nReturn: 17% gain in 3 days\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpuatviwbsb71.png?width=1617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b2dded0bca2a31dda00d5c4f94b3550a5a5f5cc\n\n**What do these charts all have in common?**\n\n**1) Strong momentum stocks.** Every one of these (except CRCT which was a recent IPO) had doubled or more in the past six months. None of this buy low, sell high stuff here. We want to buy high and sell higher.\n\n**2) High ADR (Average Daily Range).** You want to trade the fast stocks, the truly explosive stocks, and a high ADR is one of the best ways to find them. The average ADR on these five stocks was above 8%. Our minimum ADR will be 5%.\n\n**3) Consolidation.** The stock made a big move upward, and then began trading sideways with a tightening range. Forming higher lows and lower highs. The ideal flagging pattern we are looking for is technically referred to as a \"pennant.\"\n\n**4) Moving Averages.** Every one of these stocks was either riding or bouncing off of their 20 day simple moving average. There is something truly magical about that yellow line on my charts, and I don't know what or why it is, but it simply works. This is absolutely key to remember, to avoid stocks that are either too slow or over-extended, focus on those at or near the 20 SMA. Occasionally you can find good breakouts above the 20 SMA that are riding the 10 SMA, but these have a higher failure rate in my experience.\n\n**5) Strong breakout from their range on high volume.** A \"breakout\" refers to a stock punching through the top of the consolidation flag you drew. Ideally you want to see fast rising price action on large volume. This is your entry point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to see more charts and examples of this strategy, [**this four hour video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx8GvtAxilk) should give you plenty. If you are going to employ this strategy, I highly recommend investing those four hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Trading Process\n\n**STEP 1:** Set up a scanner and run it the night before your trading day. I will give you all of my scanner settings below to get you started. Your welcome.\n\n**STEP 2:** Go through every single stock in your scanner. Look for the most promising stocks. In other words, the stocks that have the five criteria I listed above. If you spot a good stock, do three things: 1) Draw a flag around the consolidating price action. 2) Set an alert to the top of the range, to notify you when a breakout from that range occurs. 3) Add the stock to a breakout watchlist. I don't know if you can do any of this with Robinhood, but you ought to have a real broker and charting software by now. I use ThinkorSwim, but there's plenty of good software options out there, like TC2000. Don't be afraid to pay a bit for good software, if you have to.\n\n**STEP 3:** Before market open, you should now have a solid watchlist of breakout candidates. Go through the list and see which setups look the closest to breaking out, or which have already broken out in the premarket action. Also look carefully for anything that may bounce hard off the 20 SMA. These will be your primary focus, but you should also have alerts to all other stocks in your watchlist to notify you of a breakout.\n\n**STEP 4:** If a strong breakout from the range occurs, meaning good rising action on good volume, you want to buy quickly. I would recommend a minimum of 10% of your account, to a maximum of 25%, but follow your own personal risk tolerance. Set a stop loss order just below the low price of the day. You should always be using a stop loss, especially as a beginner and especially with these volatile stocks.\n\n**STEP 5:** If the stock has stayed above your entry price by the next day, you can raise your stop to the entry price if you wish, to limit your loss to breakeven. After 3-5 days, or after very strong price gain, you should take some profits. Anywhere from a quarter to a half of your position. The rest we will let ride.\n\n**STEP 6:** Use the 10 day simple moving average as a trailing \"soft\" stop for the remaining shares. If it looks like the price action is going to close below the 10 SMA, then close out the entire position. The reason I emphasize close is because intraday price action can be volatile, and you don't want to get stopped out from a small dip just below the 10 SMA, if possible. If you don't have the time to watch the market during the day, feel free to use a hard stop.\n\n# Scanner Settings\n\n**ADR (Average Daily Range) above 5%**\n\n**Price X% greater than Y days ago (1 month, 3 month, 6 month scanners)**\n\n**Price within 15% of 6 day high**\n\n**Price within 15% of 6 day low**\n\n**$Volume (close \\* volume) greater than 3,000,000**\n\n**Listed Stocks Only (No OTC, etc.)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 Month: 25% Greater than 22 Days ago\n\n3 Month: 50% Greater than 67 Days ago\n\n6 Month: 150% Greater than 126 Days ago\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to adjust these settings to get more or fewer results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ADR code for ThinkorSwim:**\n\n`#Hint: ADR`\n\n`def len = 1;`\n\n`def dayHigh = DailyHighLow(`[`AggregationPeriod.DAY`](https://AggregationPeriod.DAY)`, len, 0, no).DailyHigh;`\n\n`def dayLow = DailyHighLow(`[`AggregationPeriod.DAY`](https://AggregationPeriod.DAY)`, len, 0, no).DailyLow;`\n\n`def ADR_highlow = (dayHigh/dayLow + dayHigh[1]/dayLow[1] + dayHigh[2]/dayLow[2] + dayHigh[3]/dayLow[3] + dayHigh[4]/dayLow[4] + dayHigh[5]/dayLow[5] + dayHigh[6]/dayLow[6] + dayHigh[7]/dayLow[7] + dayHigh[8]/dayLow[8] + dayHigh[9]/dayLow[9] + dayHigh[10]/dayLow[10] +dayHigh[11]/dayLow[11] + dayHigh[12]/dayLow[12] + dayHigh[13]/dayLow[13]) / 14;`\n\n`plot ADR_perc = 100*(ADR_highlow-1);`\n\n**Screenshot (all scanners combined)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/334oc34jbsb71.png?width=1646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac5aa76d696358d6f2ad15ababe6045bf139a158\n\n# The Other Side of Breakouts: Break Downs\n\nI'm going to recommend that you don't anticipate breakouts. In other words, don't buy a stock simply because it is trading in a good consolidation pattern. Wait for the price to break upward from the range before you buy. The reason for this is that consolidation flags don't only break up, they can also break down. I'll just mention that this can actually be used as a profitable shorting strategy, but I won't go into depth on that in this guide. And I don't recommend shorting for a beginner trader either. Let's take a look at a few examples of recent break downs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SOFI**\n\nSOFI formed a decent flag in June, but then broke down from that range on 6/24. This day on 6/24 would have been a clear signal to either exit a position, or to short the stock. The price simply collapsed hard after this point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9fk1wrn0csb71.png?width=1623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cf5299e56581d562e7ed71f80bf42b78886cdde\n\n**AMC**\n\nAMC formed a very strong looking flag in June. I actually broke my own rules and bought this in anticipation on 6/29. But I exited the position quickly on 7/1 when it became clear the price was breaking down from its range. After that, the price collapsed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y91p2tj1csb71.png?width=1625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86bf88d5c3acfd4253ae31424396d0c187c444ca\n\n# Putting it all together. More complex charts.\n\nLet's take a look at a couple little more complicated, tricky charts. We need to stretch your brain a bit with less simple examples.\n\n**\\[redacted small cap\\]**\n\nHere you can see three consolidation flags back to back, with differing follow through. Flag, breakout, flag, breakout, flag, break down on the 20 SMA. You will frequently see hard rising stocks following this \"stair-stepping\" sort of pattern. Still pretty simple, so let's try something a little harder to see.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rve956djisb71.png?width=1623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94584a68a32c9ada4cd5494af413ae41833feead\n\n**PLBY**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbkvm3m4csb71.png?width=1609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c145defa11d2a47b4097e23b8374acc32d543c2e\n\nStudy this chart carefully, and you can see everything discussed so far. PLBY formed a nice flag in May. It broke down from this flag on 5/11. But then it seemed to trade sideways for a bit and form another, larger flag again.\n\nNote that the breakout/breakdown point for the first flag was the 20 SMA, and the breakout/breakdown point for the second flag was the 50 SMA. This is no coincidence, and will be seen often. Some stocks will move based on the 50 SMA rather than the 20 SMA, and these can be traded as well, but they are slower moving stocks, and I recommend for smaller accounts to just focus on those stocks near the 20 day.\n\nThe failure point for the second flag was on 6/14. After that the price has collapsed.\n\nOne more thing to note on this chart. There are two points where the price on PLBY broke hard upward from it's range, but then quickly fell back down into the range. These are referred to as \"false breakouts,\" and will happen to you often. Note that the first false breakout occurred well above the 20 SMA, which is one reason to avoid breakouts well above the 20 SMA. They just haven't consolidated enough and have a higher failure rate. Patience is king.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**When is the best time to employ this strategy?**\n\nThis strategy should only be employed during a rising bull market, or possibly during a sideways market. Breakouts will not work well in a declining market, and some other strategy must be employed.\n\nThe absolute best time for breakouts is shortly after a pullback in the market, when stocks begin to recover quickly. You can see some explosive moves during these periods.\n\n**How do you deal with breakouts that have gapped up in premarket?**\n\nThose are more difficult. It all depends on the price action. If something has gapped up huge in premarket, I will generally just pass on it. But if something is just starting to break out in premarket, I will look to enter. The exact percentage is difficult to say unfortunately, but anything up more than 10% is usually a pass for me.\n\nIf I do enter premarket gappers, I won't enter immediately on open. I'll give it one to five minutes to watch the price action. If the price is stalling or dropping at open I won't buy it. But if it is showing strong volume and rising, that is what I want to see for a buy.\n\n**Can this strategy be done with options instead of shares?**\n\nIt is possible, but I wouldn't recommend it, especially to start. Breakouts have a high failure rate, and options are very unforgiving to failed trades. If you do decide to use options, I would suggest being much more aggressive with your profit taking, perhaps even selling same day on a breakout. Since this is a swing trading strategy, you can go quite short dated on the expiration, around one month dated should be fine unless you want to try for a bigger move or gamble with even shorter expiry.\n\n**What do you set your stop losses at?**\n\nAlready explained above. First day, the lows of the day. Second day, cost basis. After that, use 10 day SMA as a trailing soft stop.\n\n**When do you take profits?**\n\nAlready explained above. Take quarter to half profits after first big run up, usually around 3 to 5 days. Then use the 10 SMA as a soft trailing stop.\n\n**What if the stock gaps down hard overnight? My stop won't protect me from that!**\n\nThis is true. The only way to avoid overnight risk is to be a pure day trader and to never hold overnight. Personally I find swing trading to be far more profitable, since the big moves take days to play out. Swing trading also gives you much more time and freedom to live your life, since you can simply hold a winning position for days or even weeks, and don't have to sit and stare at a screen all day long to make money.\n\nStocks gapping down big overnight is actually quite rare, but eventually you will experience it. But, let's do the math. Let's say you put 10% of your account into a stock, and some news comes out and it tanks a whopping 30% overnight. As a percentage of your account, that is 10% \\* 30%, or 3% of your account. Definitely not good, of course. But you aren't going to go broke losing 3% of your account. It can be overcome with time and good trading. This is just part of the risk of being a trader.\n\n**I am curious if you handle \"memestocks\" or other very popular stocks differently. I hear a lot of people say these stocks don't act rationally. Do you take more/less risk with stocks like this?**\n\nYes, meme stocks often have much more support and move stronger than most other stocks. For this reason I usually have more conviction to trade them, so I will put on a bit more size or even slightly anticipate the breakouts. But I don't trade meme stocks just because they are meme stocks, they must fit the criteria and patterns described above.\n\nMeme stocks represent opportunities for massive gains and so you should take a bit more risk with them. If you got in GME early, which I did, you can make life changing money.\n\nUnfortunately today you've got too many people trying to pump too many names and everybody ends up diluting each other. It's not like a few months back when the names were much more consolidated.\n\n**Do you use any fundamentals in your trading?**\n\nNone. My trading horizon is too short for fundamentals to make any difference in the price action. Fundamentals only make a difference for long term investors. If you are a short term trader, you don't need to worry about fundamentals at all imo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Additional Resources\n\nI was going to offer several links here, but don't want to break any rules...

        "selftext": "First off I'm getting pretty tired of seeing a \"**It'S 2008 AgAiN!  HoUsInG Go BoOm!!!1!**\" every couple days.  Let's review why it's not going to happen:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The crash in 2008 was caused by lots of things but the biggest issue was mortgage companies were handing out mortgages like beads at Mardi Gras.  People who had no possible way of actually paying back the mortgage were given one anyway.  So now lots of people who normally would only afford say a 130k house were getting pre-approved for 180k which lead to:\n* Bidding wars on houses driving the prices up higher then the actual fair market value.  Which these same people who shouldn't have been approved for the higher amounts were buying and then:\n* Huge numbers of people defaulting on loans that they should have never been given in the first place which lead to all the banks begging for the feds to bail them out and the feds said:\n* Fuck yo loans, you should have known better which lead to the [single biggest drop in the Dow of 777 points](https://money.cnn.com/2008/09/29/markets/markets_newyork/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this going to happen again?  No.  Why?  [Because it was a fucking mess in 2008](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-us/learn/2008-market-crash#what_date_in_2008_did_the_stock_market_crash) and a bunch of new regulations were put in place to make sure it doesn't.  But why are prices so high?  Because Americans overall are doing better through the pandemic then worse and have more to spend.  In 2008 US households **lost $8 trillion in wealth**.   In 2020 US households **gained $13.5 trillion in wealth**.  [The majority of Americans are doing pretty fucking fantastic](https://www.wsj.com/articles/during-covid-19-most-americans-got-richerespecially-the-rich-11624791602).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut Inflation!!!  Inflation will stop everything!!   No, it won't.  You know why they are saying inflation is transitory this year?  Because it is.  Will inflation this year be higher then a \"normal\" year?  Possibly.  Is higher inflation here to stay?  Highly unlikely.  Remember 30 seconds ago, the whole US household wealth thing?  Turns out when we have lots of extra cash we spend it.  Also turns out when there is suddenly higher demands for almost everything that prices tend to go up.  Lets look at why that is:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* [Unemployment](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate) went from a peak of around 15% in March 2020 to 5.9% currently.  A \"Healthy\" unemployment rate is 4% - 5%.\n* Up until this week most states were still offering Unemployment bonuses.  As of this week [half will keep the program in place](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/unemployment-shutoffs-states-offer-workers-cash-incentives-to-find-jobs/) until September.  Many people made more money not having a job then they did before.\n* Some of those states that have stopped the bonus are offering \"Go back to work bonuses\".\n* About 127 million US households got stimulus checks including many who simply didn't need them.  In total approximately **$391 BILLION** was handed out.\n* Many households with children started to get a advance on their child tax credit this month, which was also increased.\n* Many employees, especially ones that were paying minimum wage, have increased their rates to get people back so even at the low end people are now making more then they were pre-pandemic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain more money into the economy = more buying = more demand = prices go up.  This isn't rocket science, it's simple economics.  People who were waiting to [buy a car](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-are-used-cars-so-expensive-now-shortages-pandemic-rentals-2021-7) now had the money to do so.  Cars became scarce.  Prices went up.  But what about now?  After peaking last month wholesale car prices are starting to come down and in the coming 6 months used cars should return to \"normal\" levels.  People started buying houses, both existing and new, and what happened?  Building materials shot up.  Lumber was at a [10 year high in May](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs) and right now is back right around it's average.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are in a bull market simply because we have the cash to be in one.  People are buying more.  People are investing more.  More people have entered the stock market [in the last year then in the 12 years before this combined](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/investors-have-put-more-money-into-stocks-in-the-last-5-months-than-the-previous-12-years-combined.html).  The lowest paid people in our country are making more.  25 US states increased their minimum wage [this year](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/best-states/minimum-wage-by-state).  Inflation will subside and Americans will continue to make more money.  Our biggest problem isn't going to be inflation but actually filling all the jobs that need to be done.  Once more unemployment benefits expire and more enter the workforce we are going to find that we grew during the pandemic and will have problems filling jobs as unemployment drops to below healthy levels (sub 4%).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Stop fear mongering.  Also Bers R Fukd.",

        "selftext": "Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people\u2019s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going \u201cdown\u201d.\n\nTo be \u201cconstructive,\u201d I\u2019ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don\u2019t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn\u2019t follow the instruction manual. \n\nCH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future\n\nFrom the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. \n\n\u201cThe land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts\".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.\u201d\n\nLand is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is \u201cOne for all,\u201d and Private Land is \u201cAll for one.\u201d \n\nWith that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the \u201chouse of cards\u201d fell apart for land, didn\u2019t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.\n\nThe first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. \n\nAfter all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater\u2026 There is no reason to stay is there?\n\nCh 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past\n\nNow that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. \n\nHousehold formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\\[1\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. \n\nSo, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. \n\n  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or\u2026 They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go \u201cunderwater\u201d on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. \n\nCh 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation\n\nCongratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. \n\nWith that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\\[2\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it\u2019s \u201cBroker Freedom Credit,\u201d which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\\[3\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage\u2019s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. \n\nThis means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. \n\nTo add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\\[4\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)\n\nCh 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners\n\nFirst the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: \u201cThe policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower\u2019s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.\u201d[\\[5\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)\n\nSecondly, with the supreme court\u2019s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria\u2019s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\\[6\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)\n\nFinally, \u201cStarting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac\u2019s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area\u2019s median household income will qualify\u2026 The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year \u2014 or an average of $100 to $250 each month.\u201d[\\[7\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)\n\nCh 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.\n\nAs of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\\[8\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\\[9\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)\n\nThe reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. \n\nIn the words of Brett Kavanaugh: \" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.\"\n\nChapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  \n\n\n1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.\n\n2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. \n\n3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. \n\n4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. \n\n5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn\u2019t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it\u2019s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. \n\nCh. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home\n\n1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers \u201cdown payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.\u201d Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: \u201cThe program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.\u201d \n\n2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home\u2019s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home\u2019s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you \u201cextra\u201d cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you \u201cfix up\u201d the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. \n\n3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then \u201cmove up\u201d in 5 years. \n\n4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. \n\n5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. \n\n6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. \n\n7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank. \n\nThe End (Or Out to Lunch)\n\n\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftnref1) [newresconst.pdf (census.gov)](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\[2\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftnref2) [Price Match | United Wholesale Mortgage (uwm.com)](https://www.uwm.com/price-match/?utm_source=Website&amp;utm_medium=Slider&amp;utm_campaign=PriceMatch) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\[3\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftnref3) [5zpcxsawan871.png (3400\u00d74400) (redd.it)](https://preview.redd.it/5zpcxsawan871.png?width=3400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c06a8a1bf04fc69ac3b82250942f3248d4feba)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\[4\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftnref4) [Will U.S. Housing Prices Drop in 2022?

        "selftext": "*\"The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning.\"*\n\n\u2015 Saruman the White\n\nSince most of you degenerates have joined during the middle days of WSB (post 1M), I thought it might be helpful to remind you the stories of some of the OG legends. \n\nu/1R0NYMAN**, the master of homeless box spreads**\n\n['no money at risk'](https://preview.redd.it/21yvujixo9971.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a990f594a9a435a6d80e230bb87550ca2a6fe917)\n\n* Discovered an ancient spell of 'it literally can't go tits up' trading strategy called \"The Box Spread\", a multi-legged options strategy involving both buying/selling calls and puts at the same time.\n* Through his wiseness, he came to the conclusion that Box Spreads, if sold at the right time, can get him credit with 'zero risk' because his blood magic told him so\n* Out of all tickers, he chose $UVXY (because why the fuck not? It's not like Volmageddon ever happened). He was confident that he set up a play that would net him a guaranteed total of $38k of riskless profit in 2 years\n* Sold hundreds of Box Spreads on Robinhood using margin and gets paid a credit for each box spread. His account goes [from $5k of his own money to about $200k worth of risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/)\n* Proceeded to withdraw $10k in cash, because who woudn't? \n* If a Box Spread gets held till expiry it's risk free, but that's not how option selling works because there is always assignment risk...and 1r0nyman completely forgot about that\n* To make it worse, Robinhood didn\u2019t pick up on the risk level of his box spread trade and actually echoed back to him that there wasn\u2019t a big amount of risk on the trade. Much like other elders here, 1R0NYMAN found a glitch/cheatcode in Robinhood which ultimately added even more fuel to the fire\n* Got assigned short shares, -$58k loss, account closed out. Robinhood banned box spreads after the fiasco and emailed its entire client base about its policy change as a direct result of what happened with 1R0NYMAN\n\nu/analfarmer2**, the paragon of financial degeneration**\n\n* analfarmer2, the 19-year-old somehow got access to a $100,000 trading account, he described as \u2018online biz and margin\u2019\n* His first FD was a $110k bet on $ALGN with 2DTE calls. The company announced a share buyback, and shares rocketed the next day gaining him $180k. His account went to $343k\n* A couple of days later our guy dropped $170k on1DTE  SPY puts, and again got insanely lucky as the market tanked after a Trump tweet about the Chinese trade embargo. [**His trading account was up another $277k up to $646k**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cksrsf/spy_puts_277k_profit_in_1_minute/)\n* He took another massive bet the following day, buying $600k worth of SPY calls 1DTE. analfarmer2 sold out of his position at a $500k loss. He made a few more unknown trades and found himself down to $41k\n* [**3 days later**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co31pq/my_final_yolo_40k_into_cgc_calls_expiring_next/) he bought $40k worth of CGC calls in anticipation of earnings the following week. This was a more responsible trade -- he had an entire week until expiration, just imagine the possibilities. Earnings were shit, the stock tanked and his FDs were now worthless\n\nu/ControlTheNarrative, **the wizard of GUH!**\n\n* ControlTheNarrative was so wise that he managed to discover the 'infinite money cheat code' deeply embedeed into Robinhood's matrix and as a result redifined what some consider to be beyond their Personal Risk Tolerance\n* He so genius and so retarded at the same time that through his Robinhood Gold he took his leverage level to 25x \n* From an inital deposit of $2k (minimum balance to access RH Gold) he bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. He then sold an AMD Call Contracts with a $2 strike to get almost all his money back. He then used that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles the buying power, then he sold 2 Call Contracts witht he same $2 strike price to get almost all his money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin\n* Robinhood let him buy AMD stock on margin that is collateralized by AMD stock he's already sold. The AMD loop he went through made his buying power go up only because RH was absolutely retardedly (even more so than he was) still counting the AMD stock for his covered calls as part of his margin collateral to buy the options. He rinsed and repeated this process until sufficiently leveraged to his Personal Risk Tolerance (25x leverage)\n* Finally, he used his increased buying power to 'maximiz' gains by loading up on $AAPL put FDs to bet against Tim Apple. Unfortunately, $AAPL destroyed earnings and blew his account\n* To make matters worse, [he recorded the market-open and the instant nuking of his account](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/)\n\nu/MoonYachts**, the leverageborn**\n\n* Credit. Debt. Equity. Leverage. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when u/MoonYachts attacked. MoonYachts was a disciple of u/ControlTheNarrative. Through his master's teachings, MoonYachts also understood that when selling covered calls on Robinhood and if he bought the shares, the stock wasn't subtracted from the buying power. The cash balance from the covered call got added to his cash balance \u2013 increasing the buying power by the premium he took in.\n* Only the Fed Chair, master of all four elements, could beat him, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. And although his QE skills were great at the time, he had a lot to learn before he was ready to save anyone.\n* So it happened, that MoonYachts' Personal Risk Tolerance was from the netherrealm and not even the Fed Chair could match him at the time. By using the 'infinite money spell', he managed to take his [Personal Risk Tolerance to 250x leverage (a $1M leveraged position on $4k of initial equity)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drqaro/robinhood_free_money_cheat_works_pretty_well_1/) on $F stock\n* To this day nobody knows the ending of his adventures, but legend has it that banks still hate him for showing us the spell of infinite leverage",

        "selftext": "In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name \u201cpotential stocks\u201d while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.\n\n\n1. What is Virgin Galactic?\n\n\nVirgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. \n\nEasily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is\n\n\u201cto be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience\u201d\n\nThey are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.\n\nThis, by itself doesn\u2019t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. \n\nHowever, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.\n\n\n2. The market\u2019s value system\n\n\nLets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. \n\nNow, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn\u2019t be a big player, as it\u2019s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. \n\nBut what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.\n\nAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve guessed by now, this isn\u2019t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.\n\nTesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?\n\nWhile you could ague it\u2019s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.\n\nYou can debate whether or not it\u2019s rational, but it\u2019s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector\u2019s projected growth and the company\u2019s own potential.\n\nWhile Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. \n\nApple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. \n\nAmazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.\n\nModern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.\n\n\n3. Virgin Galactic\u2019s exponential potential\n\nOn January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation \nof the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.\n\nAnd now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. \n\nWhat\u2019s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push\u2019s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.\n\n\n\n\nAs far as Monday\u2019s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday\u2019s price.\n\nThe main determinant in Monday\u2019s price action will be how Virgin Galactic\u2019s flight is portrayed by the media.\n\nIf it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.\n\nHowever, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).\n\nIn this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.\n\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading my personal take on the overall situation regarding $SPCE. And I wish all of you a good evening.",

The CEO Lourenco Goncalves has stated his intent to use the free cash flow from the company to pay off the debt of the company and focus on the shareholders of the stock. **I could easily see this stock doubling or tripling within the next few months.** With talks of Biden's infrastructure plan going on, all the attention is starting to shift to commodities and steel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: CLF 25$ 1/21/22 calls. \n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice, I just like the stock.",

That's because it takes a ton of costly promotions and subsidies on both the rider and driver sides to grow a ridesharing platform. \n\n\n\nAmazon, however, could substantially reduce the high cost of new rider acquisition by just offering their over 100 million Prime members a discount for using Lyft over Uber. This would shift marketshare overnight. \n\n\n\nThen, on the driver side, Lyft drivers could be doing last mile order fulfillment for Prime Now and Amazon Restaurant when ride demand is low\u2014effectively increasing driver wages through removing time spent waiting for a new passenger while also lowering Amazon's fulfillment costs. \n\n\n\nThe operational efficiencies that come from owning both commerce and ridesharing would allow Amazon to become the most valuable company in the world.\n\n\n\nUber and Amazon are already competing on a ton of fronts.

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking about a post I read here recently. Basically, someone said they started buying stocks six months ago and have been in the red since until finally breaking even this week. As a beginner, it\u2019s so difficult, because you\u2019re excited and you understand the market returns 7-10% per year vs. nothing as cash. So six months later, when your carefully selected stocks stink, it feels bad, man.\n\nI am here to tell you to HOLD your ridiculous stock, and to wrap your head around the idea that a LOT of people have been at this for a very long time. Your stocks are doing badly because people years before you thought the same thing you did: this is a great company! And they doubled, tripled, whatevered their money, and are now selling. This results in you having an unrealized loss or reduced unrealized gain that only becomes real IF YOU SELL. But you don\u2019t have to realize it. Because you haven\u2019t lost money. Your stock has simply lost its SHORT-TERM momentum. \n\nOne of my recent stinkers has been TSM which I bought at the literal top in February. There are lots of stocks like this in tech, renewables, anything ARK. Same with crypto. And all for the same reason \u2013 people are cashing out! An analogy would be sitting at a slot machine right after somebody else just hit the jackpot. Bummer in the short term, but it\u2019s still a good machine! Back to TSM, here\u2019s a scenario: Imagine someone buys at the literal top in January 2018 @ $46. Then the stock drops and is stuck below that for 20 months straight until October 2019 when it finally breaks above $46. From there, it hangs out around the low 50s for several months until July 2020 when it nearly TRIPLES in value peaking above $140 in Feb 21. Sure, the pattern mimics what happened in the broader market, but that\u2019s the point. A TSM holder would be up over 250% today. That's sure better than 7-10%.\n\nRight now, my human emotion is thinking \u201cboo-hoo, I am still down now while others are doing well.\u201d But that\u2019s not what matters. For most people, buying individual stocks isn\u2019t a game of making a quick buck. It\u2019s a game of being capable, consciously and financially, to wait it out \u2013 sometime for years \u2013 for these kinds of gains. This concept was never explained to me, but I think it\u2019s an important lesson for beginners so they don\u2019t sell a good thing and get taken advantage of when they miss the rocket emoji.",

They also mentioned that the last two weeks are a good reminder of that point. First off, this tells me this person hasn't expanded their mind enough to understand what kind of markets derivatives can be employed in (aka, ALL markets based on the strategies deployed).

In their paradigm it may not be, but it's worth expanding that paradigm. \n\n I'm not saying it's easy to make a living off trading and we know the majority of active traders are not successful - that's why I highlight the importance of being an outlier.

        "selftext": "Hi all. Former retard here, current Starbucks barista. I'd like to issue a bear case for $SBUX because they make me want to un-exist every single day. I'll make it short, just how you guys like it. \n\nAlmost all Starbuck locations in the world and experiencing a major outage that has lasted up to 6 months now. First it only hit select stores that were remote and not well-maintained, but it's now starting to affect every single store. The reason?\n\nChina. China is experiencing a supply chain failure in almost every category. They can't keep up with the demand, and every business on the market is in an all-out bidding war to secure the materials they need to create their products. Because Starbucks doesn't have the same profit margins as some high-end worldwide fashion retailer, they simple don't bother, and let the supply in their stores run out. \n\nAs a barista, I can safely assume that 50% of the drinks I make require an ingredient that will be out of stock in the upcoming months. My store has everything, and has always had everything, but we're approaching a bitter end. My store manager says that in the decade of nation-wide experience they have, they have never seen something like this. It's bad. \n\nWant an idea of what's about to hit? My store has approximately 15 different syrups that we use for a wide range of customers on a daily basis. It's about to cut down to 4. They are no longer handing out green tea to stores. Hundreds of stores are even missing specific sizes of cups, and customers are not happy about that!\n\nMy personal hypothesis is that the Starbucks customer base will drop rapidly and the stock will start degrading soon after that. If China isn't going to get it's issue sorted by Fall, then..... I can't wait to see the results.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone. I present a bear case for the summer. \n\nI've noticed people beginning to think about the risk of an imminent crash lately on various finance and, uhh, stock-gambling subreddits. What stocks to buy in case there's a crash? Where is safe in a crash? That sort of thing. Take a look around, do some searches for 'crash' or 'bubble', you'll see it. A change in the mood. I track about 10+ finance forums every day, and I keep seeing it coming up every single day on daily threads and topic posts.\n\nOf course, there are always people worrying about downside, the risks, and there are always people yelling the market is about to crash, perma-bears etc. \"Scared money don't make money\", and a stopped clock is right twice a day.  Why might this time be different? \n\nThe backdrop\n=====\n\nThe market is presently doing well following the idea of the 're-opening play' in addition to the free money fountain of central bank programs and government fiscal stimulus. However, I think the delta strain is going to prevent re-openings lasting more than a few weeks, and I think sentiment is going to turn sharply on that. \n\nDelta can often break past vaccines, unfortunately, and it spreads like absolute wildfire among the unvaccinated. Regardless, the EU and USA are opening up anyway! Given the R0 of 6 of delta, we should see very rapid spread when mask mandates, lockdown restrictions are removed, and people are socialising like crazy in the Summer of Hedonism. \n\nI would expect by end July to mid-August, delta will be causing very big problems pretty much everywhere in the world; it's established and spreading in 80+ countries already. Other strains are also a problem and we may see new variants of delta or entirely new strains showing up in the next 2-3 months. \n\nDo you think delta is the most deadly or infectious variant of covid we'll ever see? \n\nConsider: it's already about 2.5x faster spreading, more infectious in younger adults, more likely to cause symptomatic disease, new symptoms that can cause it to be misidentified, it has reduced the protectiveness of vaccines noticeably. If you look at the death/infections rate in covid-naive unvaccinated populations like Taiwan, it's potentially a lot more lethal too. That's how much covid 'improved' itself in the 12 months that constituted the bulk of its spread so far, and right now it's spreading (and getting lottery tickets to improve itself) in more people than ever. \n\nIf it's not rapidly eliminated and has another 12 months to circulate, mutate, and continue getting stronger and work around vaccine antibodies, how bad might it become? Are state &amp; national governments in the EU &amp; US &amp; Japan etc taking actions that would eliminate covid before it gets any stronger, or taking actions that will likely allow it to continue to spread and develop?\n\nThe Bear Case\n=====\n\nMy key argument: Central bank and government stimulus programs were timed and globally synchronised on the assumption of the re-opening play throughout this summer. Taxpayer funds and central bank willingness/effectiveness may be exhausted should this continue another year - or two. Does anyone think life around the world will be back to 'business as usual' by the end of summer? Or will it be still 'the end of the beginning' as delta begins to reach the people that alpha failed to reach? The liquidity trap for central banks is also a real concern as printing continues and rates stay close to zero, added to uncertainty about the security of income in many sectors. \n\nThe number of doses of vaccine given worldwide is about 2 billion. The number of doses required to fully vaccinate the world just once is about 16 billion. Will covid continue to circulate and improve? What about new animal strains (remember the mink in Denmark?). What will happen to the stockmarkets and consumer demand in emerging markets with low levels of vaccination? \n\nEven if covid magically disappeared overnight in the developed world - and it won't - how can the US &amp; EU stockmarkets do well if most of the world is still being ruined by covid and new dangerous strains continue to emerge? \n\nNow consider: A CAPE10 PER of 38? - 38! good lord! (https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) - Government debts globally hitting dangerously high levels vs GDP in most developed countries? A struggling global supply chain? Stalled, chaotic re-opening plans? This re-opening can't afford to fail, but as delta arrives perfectly timed with summer re-openings and incomplete vaccination, how can it succeed? \n\nThe world is already struggling where delta is well established this month.  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/weekly-trends/#weekly_table . Some countries where delta is well established already: Russia, Indonesia, Bangladesh. Some countries with highly successful vaccination programs: United Kingdom, Israel, Seychelles. Sort by 'weekly case change' or 'weekly death change', ignore the small countries. Those are 'weekly' figures. Extrapolate out 6-8 weeks. \n\nFor discussion: What do you think is going to happen here? How do you think governments will respond? How do you think the market will respond? \n\nOther examples\n====\n\nConsider: Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, China, New Zealand, were successful in holding back covid for 15 months. But delta sneaked past all their defenses. Now they are engaged in various levels of restrictions to try and stop it. If they can't keep it under control, how are countries with low rates of vaccination and limited/nonexistent restrictions ever going to manage? \n\nAnd then we get into the economic costs of continuing to push hard on burned out healthcare systems, the economic costs of long covid, the economic costs of permanent damage to economies  (businesses that went bust and won't ever re-open - hospitality, tourism etc). A lot of businesses can survive a bad year. But it's been 18 months now struggling like this. How many of these businesses can survive 2, maybe 3 terrible years? How much of the economy can we afford to lose before we have a really serious crisis on our hands or permanent economic damage?\n\nToo much like feb 2020\n======\n\nTo me the whole situation today rhymes far too much with the sentiment and backdrop in February 2020. A deadly strain spreading. Market hitting new highs. Too many big countries not taking it seriously, Asia &amp; ANZ making a serious desperate attempt to stop it spiralling out of control.\n\nThe main difference with the February 2020 scenario? We're starting from a far, far, far higher point of stockmarket valuation (the SP500 is not just 'expensive', it's at the 2nd highest point of valuation ever, per CAPE10, and the highest ever in terms of broker margin, buffett ratio). \n\nThe investor backdrop is bubbling hyper-bullish sentiment and outright gambling on most forums, manias and pump/dumps erupting multiple times a day, and bearly [!] an inkling of bearishness. Yet we're going forward from here with companies AND consumers AND governments AND central banks that have taken a balance-sheet beating for the last 15 months. We're looking at a far more deadly strain of disease that spreads faster, hits harder. We're looking at governments that have already burned out the political support and willingness-to-suffer of their populations.\n\nThis is not a recipe for success. This is a recipe for March 2020... on steroids. \n\nSome counter-arguments against my case\n=========\n\n&gt; \"The vaccines are effective and will bring covid to a halt\". \n\nBy definition, disease with a natural R&gt;3 will continue to circulate even if vaccines are 66% effective against infection and 100% of the population is fully vaccinated. Contrast: The R of delta is around 6, the effectiveness of one of the best vaccines (AZN) is around 60%, and barely a handful of countries will have fully-vaccinated rates above 50% by the end of summer. \n\n&gt; \"Well, OK, vaccines won't stop it, but they will stop people dying of it. That's what matters. We don't lockdown for 20000 flu deaths/year.\"\n\nWhat we are seeing from delta is that AZN &amp; PFE/MDNA vaccines are **extremely** effective at preventing death generally, though less so in older people or immunocompromised people. I have read that a fully vaccinated 80 y/o has about the same chances vs covid as an unvaccinated 50 y/o, but I don't have the source to hand right now; sounds about right though. \n\nVaccines aren't nearly so effective at stopping someone spreading covid to vulnerable members of their family. While vaccines have a wonderful effect in reducing hospitalisations too, delta hits hard and spreads fast, so hospitals are already beginning to get quite busy again as a result. The problem is that this means regular hospital operation is going to be affected. If you have a hospital full of ultra-hyper-contagious-but-not-deadly plague, you can't be doing regular surgeries etc. So people will unfortunately die from that, from delayed surgeries etc, specialities on hold to help out in the covid wards. Flu has an R around 1.5 and it slams the hospital system hard every year. An ongoing (and worsening into the end of the year) slamming of the hospital system with a mostly-non-lethal-but-still-needs-oxygen/vent disease, that spreads between wards with an R of 6, that is a different matter. There's also the issue that e.g. teachers, retail, dentists, doctors, hospital staff are simply exhausted and emotionally burned out from dealing with this. The systems are under a huge amount of pressure as it is even today. It isn't realistic to expect governments to keep saying 'tough shit', all the public 'ignoring' covid all around, while these sectors crumble under the pressure.   \n\n&gt; \"Regardless of whether it spreads, or whether people are dying, no matter how bad it gets, governments will simply not lock down again. End of story.\"\n\nWe saw in Sweden last year that if governments fail to enact a lockdown, a large part of the public will do it themselves anyway. And many businesses cannot operate at full productivity if workers keep falling ill and ending up long-term sick or in hospital, even if those workers remain alive. Many businesses cannot profitably operate on 30-50% custom. Ultimately, democratic governments cannot force you to go out and get slammed by a deadly plague providing you have enough money in the bank to avoid it. The retail &amp; hospitality economy will not prosper if the only people out shopping/eating/holidaying are those unable to afford the luxury of hiding at home from a massive covid outbreak. \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-sweden-retail-idUSL5N2BX1EK\n\nRandom things\n====\n\nRemember, whether it's 1987 or 2020, you don't get a warning before the rug gets pulled from under your feet. A trip down memory lane. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ES4uVEcXsAEqZkT?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096 . https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51829852 . Not that long ago, really?\n\nAlso - \"Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy\", the sage wrote. But what does **greedy** look like? Does it look like 'my stock is worth $1m/share'? No. **Greedy** looks like this: smart, sensible, sane people saying things like 'well OK, sure this market seems pretty weird, idiots being stupid, but the music's still playing, and I think there's still time to skim a quick 5-10% and get out before it all falls apart. There will be a bit of warning before shit hits the fan; I'll run for the exit when I see it'. \n\nThe steamroller has arrived, it is right there, towering over them, but still their eyes are on the pennies on the ground, even though they know they ought to know better. But it hasn't started squishing ... yet. Then the moment arrives, and the door for everyone to get out is...  so very narrow. Painfully mixed metaphors but you see my point. \n\nFinally\n===\n\nDisclosure; I am now completely out of the market.\n\nSome further material for thought:  https://www.gmo.com/europe/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/\n\nA closing note: every day, the next major stockmarket crash always gets one day closer. It's like the theta decay on a long-dated option whose expiry date is a secret. Hardly there at all for months or years, the signal lost in the noise, then suddenly, it arrives, it's the day, and everything is gone at once. \n\nStay safe everyone, get your vaccines, and don't catch the plague. The zero-th rule of making money is: be alive to enjoy it.\n\np.s. If you think what I've written is wrong/stupid fair enough but  don't downvote this purely because you are currently long in the market and don't like seeing bearish sentiment. I would very much welcome thoughtful &amp; evidence-based criticism of what I'm presenting here. I would love to be wrong about this.",

        "selftext": "In my opinion, i see it quite the opposite, but only using DCA. Holding TQQQ for an extended period of time even through two major bear markets can still outperform the underlying by a significant amount with proper and consistent use of DCA. However, an investor would have to be nearly robotic in their ability to stick to the plan and not withdraw any funds even when their portfolio is nearly wiped out. The investor would also have to benefit from one of the longest and greatest bull markets in history at the end of the investing period.\n\nThe Data.\nThe DCA assumptions were that an investor started with a portfolio size of $1000 and on the first trading day of each month, deposited $1000 to the portfolio. Based on a time period of March 1999 to March 2021, this would mean the investor deposits $265,000 of their own capital over the period studied.\n\nAs a baseline to compare to, if the investor invested this amount as a lump sum instead, with QQQ the investor would have $1.65M or about 521% return at the end of the period. A TQQQ investor would only have $360K or 36% return over 22 years. This is the danger of lump sum investing in leveraged ETFs right before major crashes as QQQ easily crushed the return of TQQQ even over this extended period of time.\n\nUsing DCA over the entire 22 period creates a completely different picture than the lump sum case. Now, investing in TQQQ absolutely crushes QQQ, with a final portfolio value of $12M compared to about $1.5M for QQQ. Using DCA for QQQ actually lowers the final portfolio value slightly compared to lump sum while using DCA for TQQQ helps smooth out the volatility in the earlier years as most of your capital is deployed in the later part of the time period, during the extended bull market post 2009. \n\nFinal Thoughts.\nI would only recommend holding TQQQ long term with a DCA strategy to investors with the absolute highest level of risk tolerance and only invest money they can afford to see fall over 90% at times and in amounts that are not needed for many years. TQQQ with DCA is not a get rich quick scheme and it is a merciless violent rollercoaster that rewards only the ones with no but holes.",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello everyone,\n\nHope all is well with you on this wild trading day.\n\nI  came across a stock I would like to share called BODY (known as Beach  Body). They just completed a 3 way merger between Beach body,Forest Road and MYX fitness about 2 weeks ago.\n\nA  little info on this stock. The 3 way merger included Forest Road, MYX fitness which is a cycle bike company and Beach Body that is a  connected fitness company who has over 20 years of growth under their  belt. Beach body acquired Openfit in December of 202 (Started by Lebron  James and Arnold Schwarzenegger). This acquisition gave Lebron and  Arnold a stake in the new BODY company. They are both going to be making  their own content in the future for this company. Beach Body company is  known for its exercises Insanity and P90X which helped countless people  lose weight and change their lives for the better(Sean T is also a  super trainer and he has been massive in fitness for as long as i can  remember).\n\nThe (Forest  Road Acquisitions) is phenomenal. Here is a list of a few of the people  involved in the deal. You will probably recognize Shaq and MLK the 3rd  are apart of this company which I think is huge. IMO anything Shaq joins  always seems to make waves. (The ring company and Papa Johns Pizza just  to name a few).\n\nThe Forest Road Acquisition Corp. team includes three former Disney  senior executives \u2014  Tom Staggs, director and Chairperson of the  Strategic Advisory  Committee, Kevin Mayer, strategic advisor, and Salil  Mehta, Chief  Financial Officer \u2014 and is strengthened by the strategic  connectivity  and deal-making expertise of directors, officers, and  strategic  advisors like Shaquille O'Neal, Peter Schlessel, Keith Horn,  Mark Burg,  Sheila Stamps, Teresa Miles Walsh, and Martin Luther King  III.\n\nOn  top of this All-Star cast of people is the short interest. Yesterday I  saw that it was over 40%! Today the stock hit its 52 week low do to the  shorting that has been happening. This is the current Short interest (around %38.09).\n\nThe  BODY company is now flush with cash around $420,000,000 coming from the  closing of the merger. They are planning to do an advertising  campaign in the coming weeks for around $75,000,000. I am not sure of  the specifics but if they include Lebron, Arnold, Shaq or the Cycle  bikes that should really send this stock in the right direction. Here is  some info on the combined company.\n\n* A  diverse portfolio that appeals to a broad consumer base through a   holistic approach that brings together at-home, digitally enabled   fitness, nutrition and community\n* Generated  2020 pro forma revenue of $880 million across BOD, Openfit and  Myx,  which achieved $30 million of revenue in its first year of  operations\n* 2.6 million paid digital fitness subscribers with 96% month over month retention\n* Industry-leading 89% gross margins on digital subscription revenue across all three brands\n* The deepest library of premium fitness content in the industry that generates more than 180 million views annually\n* A  premium portfolio of branded nutrition products that are   scientifically developed, clinically tested and strategically paired   with fitness content for a holistic health and wellness experience\n* Scalable platform that enables synergies across distribution, marketing and content creation\n* Management  team with over 22 years of experience creating content,  acquiring  customers and delivering substantial revenue and EBITDA\n* Well-positioned to unlock accelerated growth and expects to achieve compound annual revenue growth of 30% over the next 5 years\n\nAs  you can see this company is already profitable. The CEO called it the  bargained price Peleton. This is the most cash they have had on their  balance sheets and they were up to $880,000,000 without this added  capital. The brand awareness should sky rocket after they start  broadcasting the new commercials.\n\nThe  biggest catalyst for the stock besides the short interest is the  addiction of BODI live interactive. (Beta testing in August and rollout  in September) Most likely they are trying to drive this thing down to  get in cheap for this huge event) They are using the technology seen in  the NBA and WWE to stream users live into a class setting and have them  on a TV where the instructor can interact with them and help them with  their form and encourage them. This should be a big deal as it bring  interaction that has never been seen besides what the cycling classes  are doing.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkHCh0EEiQw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkHCh0EEiQw)\n\nThis  is revolutionary for online fitness. It will bring the gym straight  into your home and is a very exciting Segway into the future of fitness.  I know most people who have tried to get in shape have bought gym  memberships that they barely use at some point in their life and they  spend money every month on nothing. Beach Body has 2.6 million paid  subscribers at this time. It should continue to grow.\n\nNeedless  to say the companies that have been invested in lately for short  squeezes haven't been profitable or sustainable. This one seems to fit  the bill of Short Squeeze candidate and a good investment for the  future! When I first came across Peleton it was at $17.50. The 52 week  high within a year of this low was a high of $171.09. They don't nearly  have the library of workouts that BODY has. They don't have the star  power of the people I mentioned above. Their exposure started with a  controversial commercial that got people talking about the company. This  went almost 10x without a short squeeze and any real spokesperson for  the stock. Needless to say it seems that BODY could moon! (Peleton  commercial below)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9Hu3-mJI9c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9Hu3-mJI9c)\n\nI  apologize for the long DD but this company is so low right now I feel I  have to share everything that I have learned about them. This isn't  financial advice just someone trying to be on the cutting edge of a new  public company I think has some great promise!\n\nThere  is a ton of room to grow in all segments of this business. I believe  the cycle bike is the best Peleton alternative and it is much cheaper  compared to the Peleton bike. Peleton recently had issues with their  treadmill sucking kids, pets and other objects underneath them. This  leaves some people that would rather find a nice alternative. The  swiveling screen on the bike connects to other fitness classes and you  can use that screen to get other workouts in as well at cycling classes.\n\n[https://www.myxfitness.com/](https://www.myxfitness.com/)\n\nI  am now a shareholder in the company and very excited to see what the  future brings! Happy investing and hope you guys learned something from  this DD!",

        "selftext": "tl;dr at bottom\n\nSo after using DD from [u/Criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/Criand/)'s \"The Bigger Short\" post (link in comments), I became pretty confident that there are some shady investment banks that are going to fail sooner rather than later. I wanted to find one that preferably:\n\n1. was founded after 2008\n2. had experienced insane growth in the last 10 years\n3. wasn't too big to fail\n\nand *most importantly;* most likely over-leveraged themselves using Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS)\n\nAfter sifting through investment banks, Ladder Capital seemed to be a good fit. And added bonus, the CEO, Brian Harris, has close ties to Adam Weisselberg - the Trump Campaign CFO who just got indicted for tax fraud.\n\nSo I'm ready to make my *sound* investment on Robinhood. I was looking to buy $1500\\* worth of puts on $LADR that would expire in 6 months to a year. I felt like I knew $LADR was fucked, I just didn't know when they would go under. So the longer time I give myself the better.\n\n*\\*Note that this $1500 is more than half of my portfolio, took me 3 years to save up for, and I had been saving it for a long term, riskier investment.*\n\nSo anyways, any put outside the money for $LADR sells for $0.01, so I put in an order for January of 2022. At the end of the day, it expired. I realized my mistake, and created a new order, but \"good until cancelled\", and put it in after hours. The next morning, i was notified that someone had sold me +300 contracts, and I excitedly went to look at the riskiest investment I've made to date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\*notice 7\\/16](https://preview.redd.it/8pxu9wwu53971.png?width=1390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bfec9ce5cb59d65c61de9bfac5f3bd905de2b4d)\n\nMy heart sank when I saw the expiry date. So now I have two weeks for $LADR capital to dip under $10.00, otherwise I'm out of more than half of my portfolio that i've been building for 3 years. My lesson from all this? YOLOing your portfolio is actually pretty exciting.\n\ntl;dr: I put the wrong Expiry Date for a put order that I had done DD on, and essentially yeeted 3 years of my savings.",

I know he can be a bit snakey, but in reality, if I was to dump my lifes savings into the stocks that he'd been offering advice on, I'd have a return of 22% in the space of a week.

        "selftext": "I've seen a lot of misinformation and, quite frankly, stupidity on this sub recently (okay, for a few months now). Usually, i just shake my head and sigh when the latest session of musical chairs on one ticker, or another, occurs after being pumped on here. The dump then occurs within 5 to 10 minutes of open, leaving a lot of bag holders. \n\nI've tried to stay out of these things, even though i could profit off it. The reason for this is two fold. First, I'd rather buy companies that I am actually okay with holding, because unlike most of you, i can be patient and therefore my investment horizon for a \"baghold\" is longer than a day, week, or month. The second reason is that I feel gross taking advantage of people who just dump their life savings without much due diligence into what they are investing in, in the hopes of getting rich quick (much too often resulting in them buying utter garbage). While it would be equivalent to taking candy from a baby, I'm not out to harm people for my own benefit. I grimace when i recall cases like the individual who was expecting his 4th child in two weeks, but who dumped his entire savings into a RKT earnings options play, and subsequently lost everything. I can understand gambling with your money, but i find it deeply disturbing when people gamble with their families money. \n\nWith that said, somehow WSB ends up sweeping me along for the ride sometimes. First with the Corsair 35$ Call Options I bought for August 20 (and had bought much before the pump of Corsair) that i was forced to sell because it would have been ludicrous to keep them. The second was when I bought some calls on SOFI, expecting a short term jump after it crashed and ended up selling because it got pumped. I kept my shares in both, because I strongly believe in them and because the premiums are great for covered calls. I was in SOFI before it got pumped, and decided not to sell because I believe it is the next Ant Financial alongside Square, but for America (and eventually globally?). With that said, people who had done their DD would have known that EagleTree Capital/Insiders keep selling when the stock moves past 35. \n\nI digress, however. because I wanted to make some points. The first one is that there are people who have been pumping stocks they know to be shit because they want to make money off your hopium. This guy here is one: [Russell Reconstitution and why I believe $RIDE is the best play to capture gains : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6tev5/russell_reconstitution_and_why_i_believe_ride_is/) . To be clear, this was only one of a few posts made around that time, but I confronted the individual who has now deleted his account (you'll likely see why further down), because I knew people were going to get fucked without lube and I didn't want to see people lose their money. Ultimately, i was downvoted to pieces. However, i ended up being right, because now in addition to the SEC investigating Lordstown, the DOJ is now doing so as well:  [Justice Department Is Probing Lordstown Motors - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-is-probing-lordstown-motors-11625239730?mod=hp_lead_pos3). \n\nThe second thing is that you guys are playing musical chairs with each other, and more often than not taking money from each other when you do your little \"short squeeze\" plays. Let me explain two things to you, and you'll understand why. The first is the concept of daily short interest fee, and the second is the concept of maintenance.\n\n* The short interest Fee is calculated daily. What does that mean? Well if the short interest fee is 100%, and you have 1M dollars worth of shares sold short, then you multiply 1M by 100%. So, you literally do this 1,000,000\\*1. Then you divide by 365. So 1,000,000/365=$2,739.72. So, we'll round up and say that the short interest fee is roughly 2.75K a day. While it can be punishing in the short term, in the aggregate, it will take a sustained period of high interest rate fees to actually dislodge someone that's sold short. You. as the buyers, are in essentially a prisoner's dilemma as you need to \"cooperate,\" but are also cognizant of the fact that when it all tumbles down it will tumble down hard. As anyone with half a brain cell can tell you, investing/trading is not a team game, and being first is what's important when it comes to these types of plays. To add to that, short sellers can add to their position at inflated prices, knowing that the vast majority of times the share price will decrease significantly because it has been artificially inflated. Let me be clear as to why it can be lucrative, by going back to my 1M dollar hypothesis. We know that 2.75K (rounded up) is how much you pay as a daily fee, but let's say that the stock you have sold short 1M dollars goes down by 1%. You are up 10,000 dollars, which means that even if the fee is elevated for a day or even a few days, the short seller still comes out on top.\n* Maintenance requirements are a function of volatility, and maintenance requirements go up as volatility goes up. With that said, hedge funds do not go all in on  selling short one stock. They diversify. Which is why you usually see other companies that they are short on spike when one of their holdings is attacked by a \"short squeeze attempt.\" It's because they are liquidating their (usually positive position) to post the collateral for the maintenance requirement as they wait you out with the understanding that 9.9 times out of ten the prisoner's dilemma will win out.\n* Most of the time the companies these people short are unprofitable, or extremely ill, which means they dilute themselves and end up allowing people who sold short to exit mostly intact. This ends up hurting existing shareholders, as well as people who hoped to squeeze the short sellers. This is another form of the prisoner's dilemna.\n\nFor a successful short squeeze there are several elements in play that must be met for it to have a decent to strong chance of success. These elements do not have to be the same, but the broad strokes are usually the. For three successful ones, I would direct you to Volkswagen, Gamestop, and UWMC. If you want an explanation for why each one of them was met, i can explain below.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, this is for the Mods, as i believe that it's better to be constructive than critique mindlessly. These are my suggestions. \n\n1) Tier the Due Diligence Section. Have one section for approved individuals like /u/pennyether. Individuals who have made past contributions (with the caveat that they were well written and researched). The other section for unapproved individuals would function just as the current board does now for DD where anyone can post, with the understanding that most of the due diligence will be garbage but there will be diamonds in the rough so to speak as people post there who know what they are talking about. Once identified, even if the poster has only ever written that one due diligence post, they can be given access to the section for approved individuals.  I don't like to toot my own horn, but at least i cite my sources. \n\nSome other individuals i can think of other than Pennyether are 1) The guy who wrote about SKTelecom twice even though it was an OTC, 2) The guy who talked about MX, 3) /u/gingermanns though i disagreed voraciously with his legal argument.  4) Whoever originally wrote the OG RKT Earnings Play. \n\n2) Sticky a post describing all the steps it actually takes to do a short squeeze, and then make a rule stating that they have to advance a legitimate thesis/hypothesis about how it would come about using the guideline posted in the sticky. For example, force them to address the possibility of shareholder dilution etcetera. Then shut anything down resembling \"muh short squeeze\" that doesn't conform to that.\n\n3) This is really something out of left field, but I've always questioned your ban on OTC tickers that met the minimum market cap requirement as there are a lot of good companies that have been posted here. CDProjectRed a few times, as well as the aforementioned SKT Telecom. The liquidity should not be a problem for these companies. If you believe that there is, however, you should increase the market cap requirement for OTC tickers but allow them with that heightened market cap requirement. I get that IFRIS is different than GAAP but it IS internationally recognized and there is nothing wrong with large companies listed n EUROPE/HK/London etcetera. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end this all, I'd just like to clap back at some people who badmouth one of the fundamental analysis G.O.A.T.'s, and my boy, Warren \"The Bestest\" Buffet. \n\nHe says \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\" And the majority of you folks are greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. Otherwise known as buying at the top, and selling at the bottom. \n\nSo, you know, the GOAT's a winner, maybe listen to him a bit more.",

        "selftext": "Alright retards, time for some common sense analysis about the economic potential of Virgin Galactic. Common sense? what is that? this is WSB and Apes out here don't use common sense! \n\nStill gonna throw at you anyways. \n\nToday, about an hour ago, Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Galactic took a high altitude plane ride where he got to experience weightlessness for about 4 minutes. Big fanfare surrounded the event. Stephen Colbert covering the thing and DJ Khaled releasing a song for the occasion. Great! say you? Correct. Fucking majestic. That's called textbook hype 101.\n\nNow, let's go back to the financial side of it. what is Virgin Galactic? and what do they offer?\n\nVirgin Galactic offers SUBORBITAL tourist oriented space flight, where rich people get to go up on a plane, experience zero gravity for about 4 minutes, have a nice view of the curvature of the earth and come back. that's it. \n\nNow, the ticket for such experience is priced at 400k. Yes, if you have the money, you will get to spend 100k for every minute of weightlessness. \n\nNow my issue with the potential of this publicly listed company comes from an economic principle thousands of years old. Called offer and demand -\\_-\n\nI am not hitting on the product that Virgin is offering, innovation is innovation. I am just questioning the marketable potential of the company. Who can afford to pay 400k for a high altitude ride and experience just 4 minutes of weightlessness? A VERY FEW. I read something stating that Virgin already sold like 500 tickets. Great, if there are no cancellations, that's only 200 millions \"guaranteed revenue\" for now. But more people will buy tickets you would say! how many?\n\nThere are about 3000 billionaire in the world. lets say all those Richards will buy a ticket for this 5 star roller coaster. I will go further. 10,000 millionaires will fly. Half of those space tourists will fly with Bezos and half with Galactic. That means ideally, over the lifespan of the project, for 400k a pop, the potential revenue of the project is only 2 billion dollars. My problem is, Virgin Galactic is already valued at 12 Billion Dollars in Wall street. Yep. Oups.\n\nLet put this in perspective. What I am talking about is not a P/E situation where you have continuous revenue that justifies a price over earning calculation. I am talkin about the point where we have a market saturation. A point where everyone willing and able to pay for a ride already did so, with very little potential of repeat customers. \n\nAt TODAY's market cap valuation, Virgin Galactic needs to sell AT LEAST 30,000 tickets to break even and justify the valuation. That is just ridiculous. There is rising competition in the space tourism industry and I highly doubt that there will ever be 30,000 people willing to pay $400,000 for 4 minutes of zero gravity. Conclusion: the stock is hugely overpriced due to hype and speculation. Don't be stupid. Move on and find a better investment opportunity.",

This is working out quite well for me. \n\nBut my wife and I have a dream of an own house with a garden. Prices are hell high at the moment but somehow thats always been the case in the last years. \n\nSo with my income of approx 6k a month and with my 200k I can easily get a credit of 800k to build my dream house. The land we want alone costs about 400k. \n\nBut here is my problem:\nI have to sell all my investments and then pay off a credit. So I will switch from a financial comfortable to a credit situation without any investing. 4 months a year i pay off the interest of the bank and 8 months a year I pay off the credit. \n\nI am 35 now. \n\nBut on the other hand: what am I investing for? To be able to get things i desire and to live a peacefull life without money issues. \n\nBut when is the right point to do this?

        "selftext": "This post is referencing data and info for 7/8/21. \n\nOptions market positioning shifted last two days in two places that are usually important to monitor for potential volatility. VIX and Banks. \n\n**VIX**\n\n[VIX Larger Options and P\\/C Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/hcntv4tf63a71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d1be5228b6c807b3e80711115584c5cf747e2ef)\n\nYou can see above that the **larger options trades in the VIX complex were bullish today** and a lot sitting out in August and Sept expirations.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The most unusual call option activity in the major indexes](https://preview.redd.it/fpdztnwp83a71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12ebe84759cfce42117d89722a3e8930f18f4503)\n\nIn the above, rarely do I see VIX as the most unusual call option activity in the major indexes much less the longer dated strikes (Sept, Oct, Nov, and even a Feb 22). This is also notable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Major Index Option Volumes Today ](https://preview.redd.it/84tfjz0i63a71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b210935569f4b982dd0954389ec0211aeb71242b)\n\nIn the above picture, usually this is not the case above where VIX total volume is above SPX total volume. It is worth raising an eyebrow on this today as well. It means nothing unless there is consistent volume in volatility tomorrow and into next week. \n\n**Banks** \n\nRumor has it that CPI is going to be very hot next week, but no one can say for sure (just a rumor for now). If it is real hot, then it could lead to heightened volatility (and what we are seeing today in banks could be front running that). But what is guaranteed next week is **bank earnings are coming out.** \n\nJPM is early next week and it is negative volume flows (third frame pink and green lines) for about 2 weeks now and is sitting below its volume profile heading into earnings. \n\n[JPM daily price chart is fairly bearish](https://preview.redd.it/d7e3fccr73a71.png?width=1902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1906e2fb0432576cadb97b2490a33d7ea8369d38)\n\nXLF (below) the large bank ETF saw bearish flow today. \n\n[XLF Large Options Orders today with P\\/C ratio](https://preview.redd.it/90tsozf873a71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee5834c4edcc1aa87a8680395736386b2241cacb)\n\nKRE (below) the regional banks ETF was beyond bearish (a Put dumpster fire). \n\n[KRE Large Options Orders today \\(quite bearish looking\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dopfxi4c73a71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e433edd60e0ab23b4f78cb3a4a0122f769c02f0)\n\nOverall, there hasn't been any consistent volatility in a long time and in the absence of volatility all you get is rotation from sector to sector. Which is what we have seen for a while. Volatility does throw a wrench into those rotations though. \n\nInflation could spark volatility - or it may be a nothing burger and this is another flash in the pan. But since inflation print is sitting out there and you are seeing a little more aggressive positioning in the VIX all the sudden, its worth paying attention to see if it sticks and there is some merit to that rumor. If it doesn't, party on. If it does, then the banks may be the first to front run it (and you can't really see them below because the circles are too small but IYR and HYG also really bearish too today). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Index ETF options activity from today for large orders](https://preview.redd.it/9d1o2ysla3a71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd2500d7b79b15563a41d9103f22aa0b143c3b47)\n\nAbove is the picture of the overall Index ETF action for the day. Still neutral, but the UVXY and VXX options were pretty large volume comparatively today. \n\nNot throwing a bear party with this post as that is bad for one's health but since there hasn't been any volatility in a while, so its not a bad idea to at least see if this pattern worsens tomorrow of if it fizzles out between here and early next week. If it doesn't then maybe volatility comes back for some reason.",

You are bitching about people trying to make a living on 6% (not actually 6%, I'll cover that in just a minute) of the sale of your home but you are just fine with paying 15%/20% taxes on a long-term sale or up to 37% taxes on a short term sale to a government that just pisses away our tax dollars..? I believe you have the gun pointed at the wrong people here first off....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow back to that 6%. Since the OP of the post I'm referencing is obviously very ignorant to the profession they are attempting to condemn, let me shine some light on how this shit works. No Realtor ever sees that full 6%. Ever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me try to smooth-brain this for you: When you list your home with a Realtor and agree to pay the 6% commission, once that house sells that 6% gets split 4 ways. Yup. 4 ways. 3% gets SPLIT between the listing brokerage and the agent who actually listed the home (how did you think brokerages make money and stay open..?) and the other 3% gets SPLIT between the buyer's agent and that agent's brokerage. Since most of these splits are commonly 50/50 (there are certainly areas of our nation where the split is even less favorable to the agent), the agent who you're trying to bitch about getting 6% is actually getting roughly 1.5% once all the money is divided up.  \n\nSo to sum this up, when you pay 6% on the sale of your home, your money is not going to one person's pocket and making them mega-rich like everyone apparently thinks. Your money is helping to keep 2 separate businesses running and also helping two individuals pay their bills. \n\nAnd don't even get me started about the monopoly Zillow is attempting to run so they can control the prices of our housing market nationwide. Zillow (who owns Trulia, DotLoop,  HotPads,  Buyfolio,  ShowingTime, Postlets,  Diverse Solutions, RentJuice,  Mortech, StreetEasy,  Retsly, Naked Apartments,  &amp; Bridge Interactive) is a growing cancer attempting to not only oust Realtors, but Mortgage Lenders and Property Managers as well nationwide. \n\nStop being so ignorant about this profession before your blind ignorance comes back to haunt you.\n\nAnd thank a Realtor the next time you see one.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet. \n\nI am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.\n\nNevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback. \n\nLet's get started with the \"guide\" I use for investing.\n\n# Before we start\n\n1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:\n\n|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Assets** \\- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|\n|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|\n\nWhere to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.\n\n**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.   \n**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.\n\nEDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)\n\n\\---\n\n2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:\n\n|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|\n|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|\n\nYou may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.\n\n\\--\n\n# Doing your own DD \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Previous Steps** |\n|:-|\n\n\nThe question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:\n\n1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**\n\nStart informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.\n\n2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.\n\nThe tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.\n\n3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.\n\nNow it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.\n\nIn the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.\n\nAssuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**First Filter** |\n|:-|\n\n\nYou want a company that gives you a \"**yes\"** for the following questions:\n\n|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|\n|:-|:-|\n|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|\n|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a \"living\" company.|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Second Filter** |\n|:-|\n\n\nAre you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.\n\n*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*\n\n* **Balance Sheet**\n   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?\n   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?\n   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?\n* **Income Statement:**\n   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?\n   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?\n   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?\n\nHere you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a \"**yes**\" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Third Filter** |\n|:-|\n\n\nLet's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company\u2019s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**\n\nHow much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Fourth Filter** |\n|:-|\n\n\n**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.\n\nA higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.\n\n**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.\n\nA higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**. \n\nA low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.\n\nWhen the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.\n\nCompare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:\n\n* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.\n* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.\n* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.\n* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.\n\nAre you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Fifth Filter** |\n|:-|\n\n\nKeep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!\n\nIt's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years. \n\n\\--\n\nIf this helps at least one person, it will have been worth it. I hope you guys liked it and please do not hesitate to tell if you have any comment or feedback. Cheers!",

        "selftext": "This post is to consider buys and options in CLF. There is VERY large near term risk and reward.\n\nCLF is a US steel manufacturing company, one of the worlds largest, and environmentally cleanest.  Says they: \"Cleveland-Cliffs is the largest flat-rolled steel company and the  largest iron ore pellet producer in North America. The company is vertically integrated from mining through iron making, steelmaking,  rolling, finishing and downstream with hot and cold stamping of steel  parts and components.\u00a0\" It is not new to WSB, usually\\~ top 25 tickers mentioned prior 10y.\n\nTODAY there is a monstrous \"Infrastructure\" bill being considered (bridges, roads, rail) for $715 BB that just passed the house. Will it pass the senate ? We will see. That is the play here. It is a straight fundamentals/value play, with a transformative binary event coming.\n\nTBD consider- on the plus side, all the steel needed to correct crumbling bridges, falling condo towers, the rebar for concrete, and the new Amtrak rail proposition...most all of this will come from steel made by CLF. It is a domestic pay to play contracting deal. CLF knows this. They have aquired Arcelor Mittal and AK steel to become THE player that will directly benefit from the passage of the bill. There are financial minuses. To doot:\n\nPLUSES:\n\nYUGE Infrastructure Contrax Potentate Transformer events imminent\n\n110MM in cash\n\nProfitable with 4 BB in revenue per Q (!!)\n\n10x positive momentum, from the 2020 trough\n\n2/3 of ownership is institutional / bullish hedges (Lazard, Wellington, Victory, Berkshire/Buffet, Viking et al)\n\nShort float &gt;10%\n\nCramer likes it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMINUSES:\n\nMassive Insider purchase/sell churn of 40 MM shares / 12 mos. Why?\n\nDebt=Assets = 6BB\n\n\"Other Liabilities\" = 6BB (WTF are those??)\n\nShort float &gt;10%\n\nCramer likes it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOVERALL \n\nThe next week will determine if the Senate will pass this infrastructure thing. It is NOT CLEAR if the 1716 bipartisan earmarks funds for politicians home districts (\"pork barrel profit\") will be enough to guarantee votes to pass this overstuffed pig through the Senate. This is the sub-Trillion dollar Jabba the Hutt of bills, being shoved through the door before another election, while its still possible. Negotiation is happening. A few R votes were in swing districts. However, only a few moderate/conservative seantors are needed now. It is also not clear overall if politics will interfere (despite everyone wanting to fund infrastructure), because D are demanding a concomitant social reparation and reconciliation bill, and holding this one hostage, to get equality repaired. This game of chicken will end, one way or another. Ind/Green are on board, for what minor impacts that it matters to. Usually, veterans, energy, environment, and infrastructure are political sacred cows that dont go begging, and the parties can get past theirselves to fund something. Right now the Inf bill and the D hold a 2% advantage, and that is all that's needed. The benefit is to the home CLF steel plants in MI and MN are accompanied by powerful senators Klobuchar and Stabenow. It's big, it's ugly, it's lobbied sausage. We proceed, woke to that. I assert nothing here of disparaging nature, the company is solid and, Can Do.\n\nObviously the CEO Goncalves has repositioned the company with aquisitions and debt leverage to take advantage of the possibility of a monster legislative win for this profitable domestic steel company. There is a gigantic balance sheet with big sleeping line items that only a professional forensic accountant could detail accurately in order to assess true risk (not myself, I just Like the Stonk). But Goncalves thinks that this Godzilla of spending will pass, and that negotiations this week will make it run. Normally mining and basic materials are boring. NOT this week.\n\nIs it all \"priced in\" already ? No. Personally I think the 113 missing people from the Miamo condo, the worsening climate, buckling NW roads, and the possibilty to rebuild Amtrak, but using massive amounts of CLF steel to build new rail etc. will make this a triple bag over the next Q, even w/o Options. Revenue is up for 4 Q straight. There is overall gross political alignment and momentum. Only the trigger remains. \n\nWe are building, we are emerging from pandemic isolation to find buckled roads, falling structures, and no war to suck up commodities. This is the spend, this is the company. If you dont like it, you can go pound sand with Vulcan Materials $VMC and do a concrete play, or pump copper with the $COPX ETF. I dont own those. Disclaimer: I have 100 CLF shares, considering more if I can dump some volatile biotech.\n\nThis short analysis is my own. Do your DD, find out for yourselves, you beautiful retards, I love you. Maybe CLF will too.\n\nBest of luck",

        "selftext": "**Valuation: Undervalued**\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Technologies Inc Investment Summary:***\n\n\u00b7 Recently, there has been a lot of excitement around Palantir, however, very few people actually understand what they do and how they operate. As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactly what Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now.\n\no I am no data engineer, so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does, some of my interpretations may be off, so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong.\n\n\u00b7 Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent, Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long-term hold.\n\no The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports, and any news that may come out.\n\n\u00b7 It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is, which is why my investment plan (found in the \u201cplan\u201d section) is different than usual.\n\no There are various risks to this investment (like there are to every investment), these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the \u201crisks\u201d section.\n\no Additionally, there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir\u2019s share price, both in the short and long term(s). These catalysts are listed at the end of this report.\n\n***Overview of Palantir as a Company:***\n\n[$PLTR - Palantir Technologies Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/PLTR) was founded in 2003 (after their fear/anger after the events observed through 9/11) and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible. At this point in time, Palantir\u2019s only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts.\n\nHowever, since that point in time, Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises, as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications. Now, Palantir\u2019s revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts.\n\n*Palantir has 2 main software platforms, Palantir \u201cGotham\u201d, and Palantir \u201cFoundry\u201d.*\n\n[**Palantir Gotham**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/) was their first software platform and was designed for defense/intelligence use cases. Palantir has stated that this kind of platform helps agencies find \u201cneedles in thousands of haystacks\u201d. They also noted that [Gotham helped soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact-Study-Palantir-Defense-During-Drawdown.pdf) to map networks of bomb makers and insurgents through deep/hidden patterns and datasets, helping the army save time and lives. Since this mission, Gotham has expanded into defense operations and mission planning. During this time, Palantir found that Gotham could also be applied in Airbus\u2019 business, as their planes require millions of parts, assembled in multiple factories in different countries. However, Palantir decided to make another software platform that is better tailored to commercial enterprises, this platform was labelled \u201cPalantir Foundry\u201d.\n\n[**Palantir Foundry**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) transforms the way in which organizations interact with their information by creating a central operating system for their data. Palantir enables their customers to construct their own models quickly and easily from countless sets of data points.\n\nPalantir software is used by their 139 Government and Commercial Institutions/enterprises, in over 40 industries, ranging over 150 countries. Palantir works with the US Government and their several allies abroad, as well as the worlds most important/reliable companies.\n\nLastly, Palantir has stated \u201cWe are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build the software that enable our customers to integrate their own data that they already have.\u201d\n\n***Everything you need to know about Palantir and $PLTR:***\n\n*Palantir Foundry:*\n\nFoundry is essentially a [data warehouse](https://panoply.io/data-warehouse-guide/the-difference-between-a-database-and-a-data-warehouse/) that helps their commercial customers to collect and analyze their data. Foundry\u2019s platform includes a [graphical data interface](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface) that is extremely user friendly allowing their customers to get the most out of their data. Furthermore, Foundry provides statistical analyses through the use of their [AI machine learning](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/ai-ml/) networks that are able to consistently deliver efficient and accurate results.\n\nFoundry helps to enables all of their users, regardless of their technical abilities, to work meaningfully and act with the data that they collect. Foundry provides a suite of applications that help combine data analytics and business logic, helping them to deliver superior data integration.\n\nFoundry\u2019s front-end (what the user sees) enables their users to take advantage of all of the data collected by their organization to make informed decisions. Foundry also has a fantastic application for inter-organizational collaboration, this helps a team to build on each others work.\n\n*Foundry brings all of an enterprises data together onto their platform, however there are access controls in place to define what individuals get control over which dataset(s). From there, Foundry is able to deliver advanced analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company\u2019s data, make quality insights, so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage.*\n\n**Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite.**\n\n*Palantir Gotham:*\n\nDubbed \u201cThe Operating System for Government Decision Making\u201d, Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations.\n\nGotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government, to help them find what they are looking for. Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life. This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real-world responses to threats that Gotham identifies. Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies.\n\nThere is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham, which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with. However, what we do know is that these organizations have re-signed contracts with Palantir, which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly \u201cthe real deal\u201d.\n\nLastly, Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers, primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries. Furthermore, [Palantir has been credited](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2015/01/12/leaked-documents-bernie-madoff-convicted-thanks-to.html) with assisting in finding the largest Ponzi scheme ever (Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi Scheme).\n\n*Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place. Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data, and key patterns, so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats/problems they face in real-time.*\n\n*Palantir\u2019s Approach:*\n\nPalantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis, and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data.\n\nPalantir recognises that other companies sell features, tools, applications, and/or dashboards, however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run (if at all). Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software/platform to have sustainable, reliable, and safe data solutions.\n\nPalantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large \u201cfarms\u201d of data provided by each of their client companies. By doing this, Palantir is able to feed more data/information into their machine learning, AI, and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient. This also enables [cross-industry data pools](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU), that can be used by their companies when they look to expand or for opportunities in other verticals.\n\n*Palantir Success Stories:*\n\n**BP:**\n\nPerhaps the most notable success story that has come from Palantir is their partnership with [$BP \u2013 British Petroleum](https://utradea.com/stocks/BP)\n\nBP and Palantir have been partners since 2014, and recently (February 2021) [BP and Palantir have extended their partnership](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/05/palantir-deepens-ties-with-bp-with-new-5-year-deal/) for 5 more years. Palantir has helped BP to transform their business into a more digital one, and this extension of their partnership will ensure a further acceleration of their strategic digitization of their business.\n\nPalantir\u2019s Foundry has already helped BP by streamlining and enhancing their hydrocarbon-based workflows. Palantir helped BP to analyze their drilling data and has helped them to [increase their oil production in the North Sea by over 10%.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/palantir-the-tech-spooks-who-found-bin-laden-are-helping-bp-find-oil-9qddfpv2r)\n\nThis increase in production helps us to visualize just how useful Palantir\u2019s software can be. This is why their Foundry has been credited as a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d. Other oil producing companies most likely would not have been able to uncover the data, patterns, and relationships that were uncovered by Palantir, thus the companies that are not using Palantir may be losing out.\n\nThis type of publicity is fantastic for Palantir, as companies may see this, and contact Palantir because they too want a competitive advantage. Palantir\u2019s best chance at becoming the next \u201ctech giant\u201d comes through the commercial applications/contracts. This is because there are infinite uses for Palantir, so theoretically, they can get it in the hands of every business (which would help revenues to soar).\n\n**National Institute of Health (NIH) and Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS):**\n\nPalantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE. However, recently Palantir has been getting good press, which has helped their company image. Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir, for Palantir\u2019s assistance with their fights against COVID-19, and their vaccine distributions. This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID-19.\n\nThe NIH agreed to a [$36M contract](https://www.palantir.com/pt_media/nih-palantir-contract/) to gain a partnership with Palantir. Their (NIH\u2019s), mission is to build the largest centralized COVID-19 patient database in the world, and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success.\n\nPalantir was able to assist the NIH in building their [N3C data platform](https://covid.cd2h.org/). This platform has come a long way since they teamed up with Palantir, and now has over 7.1B rows of data from 6.5M patients, from 57 different databases. Without the assistance of Palantir, analyzing this amount of data would have been no easy feat, however Palantir has provided the NIH with advanced analytics in the matter of minutes thank to their machine learning capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, in December of 2020, Palantir signed a [2-year $31.5M deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201223005018/en/Palantir-Continues-Vital-NHS-Work-With-31.5M-Contract) with the Brittan\u2019s NHS. This partnership requires Foundry to provide a secure, reliable, and timely platform to process data, while protecting patient privacy, to ultimately improve patient care.\n\nBoth of these partnerships highlight the need for Palantir during a crisis and having these large Government Health Institutes choosing Palantir as their first options is a great deal, and shows their confidence in Palantir\u2019s software.\n\n*Sources:*\n\n[The power of data in a pandemic - Technology in the NHS (blog.gov.uk)](https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/28/the-power-of-data-in-a-pandemic/)\n\n*Strengths:*\n\n**Built-in Privacy Controls:**\n\nBy having [privacy controls](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU) in place, Palantir is able to operate in places that other data companies cannot go. This is especially true for Foundry, where companies/individuals can request cross-industry data from other Palantir clients to help them in a variety of ways. This request for external data needs to be accepted by a representative of the other company to be allowed. This helps Palantir leverage all of the data that they have on their \u201cOperating System\u201d, which essentially makes their platform a cross-company/cross-country collaborative workspace for all. As Palantir attains more clients, the more attractive/extensive their database is for potential clients. This should help Palantir to expand quickly once they get the ball rolling.\n\nPalantir truly values this privacy and has integrated data legibility, audit logs, access controls, quality checks and requirements to attain external data.\n\n**Government Grade Security:**\n\nAs we know, Palantir started out in just the defense and intelligence spaces. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the get-go. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This is no easy feat, however Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients, because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has [IL-5 clearance](https://simplemoneylyfe.com/palantir-stock-analysis/) with the Department of Defense (DoD), which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance (alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP). However, it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of **classified information.**\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.\n\n**Expansion into the Commercial Sector:**\n\nPalantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector, partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry.\n\nPalantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization/operations. Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector, and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises.\n\n*Government Contracts:*\n\nDo you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling? If so, you will know where I am headed with this section.\n\nBetween 2008-2018 (10 years), Palantir was able to generate $51.9M in revenue from government contracts. However, in the 2 years following this they earned $179.9M in Government contracts (this can be found under the \u201cUS Government\u201d section of their [SEC 10-K report](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)). Once Palantir was able to get the ball rolling with these agencies, Palantir was able to both expand and renew existing contracts to earn more revenue. I believe that the same thing will happen with Palantir\u2019s commercial operations. Once they start to get a large number of big enterprises renewing their contracts for \u201cbigger bucks\u201d, I believe that Palantir will start to grow their revenues extremely quick and attract new clients \u201cleft, right, and center\u201d.\n\nThese contract renewals are so important because essentially, they mean that Palantir met and/or exceeded expectations, and these companies now believe that Palantir is vital to their business/operations, so look out for news around renewals.\n\n*Business Model:*\n\nPalantir has developed a business model that focuses on acquiring contracts and expanding their services and has 3 main phases.\n\n1. **Acquire Customers:** Palantir has expanded their sales force largely over the past couple of years, and actively purse negotiations with companies that they can provide long-term value to. To acquire these companies, Palantir gives them a short demo to see how effective and user friendly their software is, Palantir provides this service for a loss. However, they are willing to incur these (proportionately) small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies. This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase.\n2. **Expand:** Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook, they move them along to the expand phase. Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes, of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it. These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost (Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well), however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir\u2019s software during this phase and see what it has to offer. If they like their software, they will be moved along to the next phase (scale) which is Palantir\u2019s bread and butter.\n3. **Scale:** These clients tend to sign longer-term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a \u201cgood feel\u201d for their software. The companies in this stage are also generally \u201chands-off\u201d meaning that they can operate the software without much help. Companies tend to find the most value in this stage, and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage. In 2020, Palantir made $613.4M in this stage with a margin of 70%\n\n*Financial information:*\n\nAll of this information can be found in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Palantir increased their gross profit by 47.97% and increased their gross margin to 81% (from 71%), Palantir reported their first net income (excluding stock-based compensation) ever and increase their net revenues by 47.15%.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Palantir\u2019s loss from operations increased by 103.61%, their stock-based compensation increased by 425.15%, their General and Admin expenses increased by 108.59%, and their net loss increased by 101.22%. Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock-based compensation, which will be addressed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Convertible Preferred Stock:** In 2020, Palantir issued a total of 797,771,675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous \u201cconvertible referred shares\u201d. This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s stock of 137.19%. This is a huge form of dilution, and I have never seen anything like this before, however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that.\n\n\u00b7 **Repurchase of Common Stock:** In 2020, Palantir repurchased 808,201 shares back. This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock, however any buyback is good to see as an investor. This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0.14%, which is not much, but we will still take it.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Warrants:** In 2020, Palantir experienced an additional 7,631,329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants. The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir\u2019s stock of 1.31%.\n\n\u00b7 **Common Stock (Net of Issuance Costs):** In 2020, Palantir unloaded 206,500,523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs. I believe that this means that, Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public. I could very well be wrong on that, and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great! Anyways, this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s common stock of roughly 35.51%. This is a large portion of dilution, however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir added 120,617,527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options. These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20.72%. Once again, this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors.\n\n\u00b7 **RSU\u2019s:** In 2020, Palantir issued 82,429,575 shares through their vesting of \u201cRestricted Stock Units\u201d (RSU\u2019s). This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14.18% (which is a lot of dilution).\n\n\u00b7 **Modification to Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir technically bought back 3,500,0000 shares through modifications to stock options (for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options). Confusing, right? This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0.6%.\n\n\u00b7 **Total Share Dilution in 2020:** In 2020, Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208.19%. This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed, however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020.\n\n*Explanation of Share Dilution:*\n\nOnce again, all of the below information can be found in Palantir\u2019s [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1).\n\nOn September 30th, 2020, Palantir completed their Direct Listing of their Class A common shares on the public markets on the NYSE. Part of this listing involved the redemption of all of Palantir\u2019s convertible share into common shares. This was the largest single source of dilution in Palantir (137%). Additionally, this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants, which resulted in dilution of 1.31%. Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued, net of issuance price to complete the direct listing, which had a dilutionary effect of 35.51%. Lastly, Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU\u2019s, which cause a dilutionary effect of 14.18%.\n\nWithout these factors of dilution, Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20%. This means that due to the Direct listing, Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188.19% to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing.\n\n*Overall Thoughts on Dilution:*\n\nPalantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution, and I have not seen anything quite like this before. Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors. However, we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing. However, how does Palantir dilution (excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years?\n\nFor starters, Palantir exhibited a 20% share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing. However, historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5.18% between 2017-2019. So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing, Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution. However, 20% of dilution is significantly different than the 208.19% of dilution (which would be crazily high). This 20% is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock, such as Palantir, so currently I would not be too worried. However, investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021, because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir\u2019s dilution after going public, than their past share dilution as a private company.\n\n*Competition:*\n\nIn order to undergo my comparable analyses (which will be discussed later on) I needed to select 4 companies, that I can compare to Palantir.\n\n[**$ZS \u2013 Zscaler Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/ZS)**:** ZScaler is a security as a service company that helps company adapt to cloud technologies and provides their cybersecurity services through the cloud. ZScaler provides their services to both commercial enterprises and governments, similar to that of Palantir. Furthermore, ZScaler offers their service primarily in the USA, but also has smaller international operations (again like Palantir).\n\n[**$SNOW \u2013 Snowflake Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SNOW)**:** Snowflake (like Palantir) is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data. Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering, data science, data applications, data sharing, and data warehouse. This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir, however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves. Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations, similar to that of Palantir.\n\n[**$SPLK \u2013 Splunk Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SPLK)**:** Splunk provide software platforms that deliver insights derived from their clients\u2019 data in the USA and internationally. Splunk offers their Ecosystem solutions that consist of data inputs, workflows, reports, dashboards, data visualizations, actions, and methods, and help their clients/customers to make the best out of their data. All of this sounds eerily familiar to the description of Palantir, making it one of the closer competitors. Splunk also offers their services to the public sector as well as the government, making their business model resemble that of Palantir so much more.\n\n[**$TYL \u2013 Tyler technologies Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/TYL)**:** Tyler technologies is probably the company in this list that least resembles that of Palantir, this is because they provide management solutions, accounting systems, billing systems and other solutions geared toward the public sector. Tyler technologies works primarily with governments of all types (Federal, State, and Municipal), and education institutions. However, the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions. Their data insights software enables collaboration, displays data visualizations/measurements, and generates insights for their human operators to act on.\n\n*Q1 2021 Updates:*\n\nAll of the below information can be found in [Palantir\u2019s Q1 Investor Presentation](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q1%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf).\n\nRecently, on May 11th, 2021, Palantir released their Q1 earnings report. When looking at Palantir\u2019s financial performance I did not take this into account, which means that this section will be packed with new information that will help us to understand Palantir\u2019s trajectory even more.\n\nFirst and foremost, this quarter was the first quarter in which Palantir has reported positive earnings. This is a big milestone for Palantir as a public company, and it helps to gets investors excited about the potentially profitable future of Palantir. In Q1, Palantir reported a free cash flow of $151M (was -$290M in Q1 2020) with a 44% adjusted FCF margin, they grew revenues by 49% YoY ($341M), and they grew billings by 248% YoY ($362M) which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts. These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir, which should excite their investors.\n\nFurthermore, during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC. This SPAC is [$QELL \u2013 Qell Acquisition Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/QELL) which merging with Lilium. Lilium is an eVTOL transportation company, with this investment they also came to a deal with Lilium to use Foundry for design, engineering, testing, production, quality, logistics, and operations. A while back I looked at another eVTOL SPAC Archer ([$ACIC \u2013 Atlas Crest Investment Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/ACIC)), which has great upside and has a similar business model to Lilium, so if you want to read that to be more informed about Liliums potential performance, [click here.](https://utradea.com/positions/Take_a_SHOT_at_Archers_SPAC_ACIC)\n\nIn Q1, Palantir was also awarded with a [5-year $90M contract](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210405005238/en/Palantir-Selected-by-the-National-Nuclear-Security-Administration-for-5-year-89.9M-Contract-for-SAFER-Project) from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER (Safety Analytics, Forecasting, and Evaluation Reporting) project. This is big news as this is one of Palantir\u2019s bigger contracts, and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir\u2019s software and their cross-enterprise data integration capabilities. On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations, the DoD used Palantir\u2019s software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence. This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right, and if the DoD likes it so much, then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises.\n\nLastly, in Q1, Palantir won 15 contracts worth over $5M, and 6 contracts worth over $10M with an average duration of 3.7 years (4.6 for commercial customers). This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this, and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal/negotiations. Additionally, Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83% (from 75% Q1 2020), and their contribution margin to 60% (from 41% in Q1 2020). This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase, the scale phase, which enables Palantir to grow their margins.\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Investment Valuation:***\n\n*Comparable Analyses:*\n\nI decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations (or opinions if you will). Preferably, I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate, however, if they are not consistent, I will take the average result. I was only able to find 2 multiples/ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios/multiples.\n\n*EV/Revenue:*\n\nThis is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet, like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies. By comparing Palantir\u2019s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (listed above on the \u201ccompetitors\u201d section of this report), I found that Palantir has a fair value of $32.85/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 23.31%. This implies that given Palantir\u2019s current price, they are undervalued, and the upside is very reasonable, however, I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains.\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Palantir\u2019s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $24.87/share, which implies that there is a downside risk of 6.64% to such an investment. As you have probably noticed, these results are not consistent, therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one, final price target.\n\n*Average Comparable:*\n\nBy taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $28.86/share, which implies an overall upside of 8.36% to this investment. This also implies that Palantir, is in fact an undervalued growth stock, that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market.\n\n***My Plan for Investing into Palantir:***\n\nMy plan for this investment is a little different from usual.\n\nI see anything between $24.87/share (Fair Value of P/B ratio) and $28.86/share (average comparable) as a good chance to buy Palantir at (or below) its fair value. This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment.\n\nHowever, I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long-run 3+ years. I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3+ years. During this time, I would re-evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding.\n\n***Potential Risks to Palantir\u2019s Stock - $PLTR:***\n\n\u00b7 **Dilution:** Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution, however, we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing. However, the 20% of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high. As investors, we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns/increases that we should be weary of. If these levels of dilution persist, potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions, which will hurt the share price.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** This year\u2019s financial performance was not one to be overly happy about. Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet, Palantir was still yet to make a profit, and increased their net losses by over 100%. If this poor financial performance continues, and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole, investors will run away from this stock and never look back. However, the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future, which will be discussed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Bad Press:** Historically, Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non-investors alike. Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through [Palantir\u2019s partnership with ICE](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54348456). Palantir quicky spoke out against this backlash by saying ICE took advantage of their software without proper oversight, and that they are looking into the issues, furthermore they have since declined some potential partnerships with other border agencies to avoid further backlash. There have also been numerous smaller controversies and protests that have damaged Palantir\u2019s reputation, and if there are more large controversies Palantir\u2019s stock could get hurt as a result of it.\n\n***Potential Catalysts that can Help Palantir\u2019s Stock Price:***\n\n\u00b7 **Share Buybacks:** Over the past year, Palantir has bought back (both directly and indirectly, in a sense) over 4,300,000 of their common shares. This is good to see as an investor, especially this early in the company (and not too long after their Direct Listing). This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future. This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares, and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** Palantir\u2019s 2020 financial report was not favourable (as discussed previously), however there were definitely some good to take out of it. Palantir increased their revenue, gross profit, and margins by a hefty amount, which is good to see as an investor, however, there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable. However, their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report.\n\n\u00b7 **Positive Press:** As previously mentioned, Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price. However, recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID-19, and their vaccine distribution efforts. Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir\u2019s technology. Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company. This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released.\n\n\u00b7 **Success Stories:** Since Palantir have gone public, they have had a few success stories come out, I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article. These success stories show how impactful Palantir\u2019s software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues, production etc. just by using Palantir\u2019s software. Any future stories like this that come out, highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar, and potential clients to reach out and start business/inquiries with Palantir.\n\n\u00b7 **Renewing Contracts:** I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir\u2019s share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case? This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir\u2019s 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years. After their time with Palantir\u2019s software expires they decide to renew the contract. This is good because it shows that Palantir\u2019s software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these $5-15M+ contract renewals. Furthermore, these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir\u2019s installation, and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins, which will reflect well on Palantir\u2019s future financial reports.\n\n\u00b7 **New Partnerships/Contracts (and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment):** Every time that Palantir, or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract/agreement, this will help Palantir\u2019s stock. This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections. Furthermore, as more commercial enterprises try Palantir\u2019s software (and hopefully enjoy it), the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot. I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry. Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment, and as more contracts role in, more enterprises will take an interest. Furthermore, when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract, it will help to increase their revenues, which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the, to beat estimates.\n\n*This analysis took a long time, and is one of the most comprehensive that I have seen, so I would greatly appreciate if you followed me* [*here*](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/BeatingTheVTI?utm_source=R&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=PLTR)*, and commented on my original post!*",

        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. \n\nHappy Independence day to all of you! S&amp;P 500 hit a new high (1.7% WoW increase) following Friday\u2019s strong job report (U.S. economy added 850,000 jobs, the most in 10 months). This marks S&amp;P 500 rise for the 7th straight day, the longest winning streak since last August. Even though the market had a strong rally, almost all the popular stocks took a significant beating in the past week.\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3q1rkh0my6971.png?width=1034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a33ca58866f42a1a9368919fd3e785ce5b96da4)\n\nThis is the first time where all the popular stocks except SPY ended in red the same week. This week's stock returns also illustrate the need for effective diversification of your portfolio!\n\nWISH continues to be the most discussed stock, but its sentiment took a significant beating following the 17% drop in the stock price in the past week (dropped to 4% from 46%). The best performing stock on the list was BlackBerry which almost recovered all its losses following the company\u2019s earnings report. A newcomer to the top 10 list is Virgin Galactic following the announcement that its next spaceflight test will carry founder Sir Richard Branson.\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3aliegymy6971.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02872056dc3f6f07f18357a616698dae9429ec56)\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**Micron Technology($MU):** MU released its [Q3 quarter results](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-technology-inc-reports-results-third-quarter-fiscal-2021) on June 30th, beating both revenue and EPS estimates. Even though the company had strong quarterly results, the stock tumbled 5% following the earnings due to raising capital expenditure forecast. Investors believe that this is just a minor blip as the company has reported impressive revenue growth of 36% (YoY) and a gross margin of 42% and MU can expect strong demand from the data center, PC and graphics, mobile markets.\n\n**Virgin Galactic($SPCE):** SPCE had a wild week with the stock jumping 23% on Friday after the company announced that its next spaceflight test will carry Richard Branson. The launch is expected to take place on July 11th and marks an attempt to beat Jeff Bezos after he announced that his company (Blue Origin) will have its first passenger spaceflight on July 20th. SPCE stock, in general, had wild swings this year with the stock climbing above $60 in February and then falling as low as $15 in May.\n\n**Vuzix Corp($VUZI):** VUZI is considered to be at the forefront of the wearable smart eyeglasses industry. The company was generating discussions as it gained almost 8% mid-week before dropping down. Investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock as reflected by its sentiment. The stock has experienced very large swings this year with it starting at $8 in Jan and rallying up to $30 in April before dropping down to its current level of $17. Still, the stock is up 109% YTD.\n\n**Paysafe($PSFE):** Paysafe is a payment platform that enables payment processing, digital wallet, and online cash solutions. The company is trending as it had recently announced its partnership with Microsoft and is now enabling online cash transactions on Microsoft Store. Adding to this, the company also announced an expanded partnership with FOX Bet.\n\n**NIO Inc($NIO):** Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer NIO has now climbed more than 20% in the last month. This strong rally is generating more discussions about the stock. In addition to this, analysts\u2019 recommendation has also become more bullish for the stock with Citigroup\u2018s Jeff Chung issuing a price target of $72 from the current $50 level. This is predominantly driven by the company\u2019s excellent shipment volume, with NIO confirming they have delivered 8,000+ vehicles in June and 21,896 vehicles for the entire second quarter.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:** ZIM Integrated Shipping($ZIM) got a boost in mentions following [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oakw8w/zim_pirates_of_the_zimmabean_dead_mans_dd/) excellent Due Diligence that was posted on wallstreetbets which showcased the company is a good long-term play. Intellia Therapeutics($NTLA) was also trending following their announcement that they have successfully corrected a hereditary disease ATTR amyloidosis, with a single infusion of CRISPR, a programmable gene-editing tool. The stock jumped 50% on the news but dropped down to a 15% gain over the last week.\n\nThank you for reading and hope you enjoyed this week's analysis! \n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*",

        "selftext": "[Archive](https://archive.ph/2021.07.07-075355/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/china-mulls-closing-loophole-used-by-tech-giants-for-u-s-ipos)\n\n \n\n&gt;Regulators in Beijing are planning rule changes that would allow them to block a Chinese company from listing overseas even if the unit selling shares is incorporated outside China, closing a loophole long-used by the country\u2019s technology giants, according to people familiar with the matter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The China Securities Regulatory Commission is leading efforts to revise rules on overseas listings that have been in effect since 1994 and make no reference to companies registered in places like the Cayman Islands, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. Once amended, the rules would require firms structured using the so-called Variable Interest Entity model to seek approval before going public in Hong Kong or the U.S., the people said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The proposed change is the first indication of how Beijing plans to implement a crackdown on overseas listings flagged by the country\u2019s State Council on Tuesday. Closer oversight would plug a gap that\u2019s been used for two decades by technology giants from [Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BABA:US) to [Tencent Holdings Ltd.](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/700:HK) to attract foreign capital and list offshore, potentially thwarting the ambitions of firms like ByteDance Ltd. [contemplating](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/bytedance-founder-zhang-yiming-steps-down-as-ceo-ahead-of-ipo) going public outside the mainland.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It would also threaten a lucrative line of business for Wall Street banks and add to concerns of a decoupling between China and the U.S. in sensitive areas like technology. Chinese firms have raised about $76 billion through first-time share sales in the U.S. over the past decade.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The changes are subject to approval by the State Council, the people said. The securities regulator plans to discuss potential revisions with firms that underwrite share sales, one of the people said. The CSRC didn\u2019t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment. Bloomberg News [reported](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/china-is-said-to-mull-tighter-rules-for-firms-listing-overseas) on the potential tightening in May.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Pioneered by Sina Corp. and its investment bankers during a 2000 initial public offering, the [VIE framework](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/quicktake/chinas-fraught-ipos) has never been formally endorsed by Beijing. It has nevertheless enabled Chinese companies to sidestep restrictions on foreign investment in sensitive sectors including the Internet industry. The structure allows a Chinese firm to transfer profits to an offshore entity -- registered in places like the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands -- with shares that foreign investors can then own.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While virtually every major Chinese internet company has used the structure, it\u2019s become increasingly worrisome for Beijing as it tightens its grip on technology firms that have infiltrated every corner of Chinese life and control reams of consumer data. Authorities so far have little legal recourse to prevent sensitive overseas listings, as with the recent [Didi Global Inc.](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DIDI:US) IPO, which went ahead despite requests for a [delay](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/china-s-cyber-watchdog-asked-didi-to-delay-ipo-on-data-concerns) from regulators.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The additional oversight could bestow a level of legitimacy on the VIE structure that\u2019s been a perennial worry for global investors given the shaky legal ground on which it stands.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;China\u2019s heightened regulatory scrutiny is echoed by tightening in the U.S. Recent [legislation](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/trump-signs-bill-that-could-remove-china-stock-listings-in-u-s) requires companies listed on U.S. bourses to allow inspectors to review their financial audits. China has long resisted letting the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board examine audits of firms whose shares trade in America, citing national security interests.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The State Council [said](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/china-vows-to-ramp-up-scrutiny-of-data-at-listed-companies) Tuesday that rules for overseas listings will be revised while publicly-traded firms will be held accountable for keeping their data secure. China will also step up its regulatory oversight of companies trading in offshore markets, it said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Under the revised rules, VIEs like Alibaba that have already gone public may need approval for additional share offerings in the offshore market, according to the people familiar.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The \u201cpolitical compromise\u201d that allowed the VIE structure as a way around foreign ownership restrictions is \u201cunder serious threat,\u201d said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, following the State Council\u2019s statement. China \u201ccan now discourage its promising firms from listing abroad, which could boost its ambitions to develop financial markets on the mainland.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One firm has already suspended its work helping two Chinese companies using the VIE structure to list overseas after being advised by regulatory officials that new rules are being put in place, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In recent days, China has intensified its crackdown on technology firms with the cyberspace regulator announcing a probe into Didi and pulling the company\u2019s app from stores. Shares in Didi, which controls almost the entire ride-hailing market in China, plunged 20% in U.S. trading just days after a $4.4 billion IPO.",

        "selftext": "$ATOS dropped a little over 10% yesterday, so SSR has now been invoked. Short selling to manipulate the price will be limited today.  The price now sits at $5.68.  There are currently 42,605 calls sitting at the $6 strike which expire today, and 66,915 calls for the $7.5 strike.  A price increase above $6 will force the coverage of 21.9M shares (with a net increase of 3.4M shares added to what should already be hedged) and a price increase above $7.50 increases that number to 28.6M shares (with a net increase over what should already be hedged of 10.8M).  Since it's the final day of trading, extrinsic premiums to buy calls are largely reduced.  Now that ATOS is part of the R2K, an estimated 37M of the 120M shares are now locked in place by index funds, so liquidity is very limited.  Additionally, short interest has been steadily climbing and is estimated to now be over 30M shares.  IF retail holds strong and a whale or two jump in, this could be the gamma storm predicted months ago.  Verify these numbers and do your own DD!

        "selftext": "OP:\n\nyou might have already heard about BioLargo or seen the post  [USA Today: BioLargo technology tackles water crisis caused by \u2018forever chemicals\u2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/n0e5o8/usa_today_biolargo_technology_tackles_water/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  on this board that got some attention. I want to use the opportunity to share some more information as IMHO BioLargo is one of the best investing opportunities out there - the perfect combination - investing in the \u201cclean\u201d future while going for the big bucks. Especially as the Clean water Bill just passed that guarantees $168 Billion for clean water. \n\nIt is just a question of time (and  Good News)  until a big wave of new investors and money will come to  join this  Clean Water, Clean Air, Cleaner Earth (and wound care)  investing opportunity.\n\nThe share price is very low as BioLargo paid off almost $7.6 Million in debt in the last years and some of the projects were delayed - but it is all happening now = we are already deep into the BLGO paradigm shift.\n\nThe  progress is accelerating: the partnerships/ California engineering  office opened/ \n\nrecord growth/ record revenues/ amazing study results/  team ups/ \n\nbiggest contracts yet/ AOS commercial units built/ promising  acquisition happened/ \n\nAEC improved/ new patents filed/ trials at  municipalities scheduled/ almost debt free / Asia joint venture showing  First adaptions/ Cupridyne/ \n\nCannabusters starting to take over Cannabis  Odor Control space/ big minerals contract expected next Q/ new studies  released/ more studies coming/ \n\n2000 new shareholders in past months/  \n\ncash flow positive on the horizon / 1.2 Millions in contracts signed  within weeks/ working on Lithium extraction/ 10 Billion Dollars for PFAS  solutions from administration announced etc. etc..\n\n**This clean tech / Cannabis/ wound care / minerals / water play seems to be the perfect place to be invested in.**\n\nSome might have bought in early But At around $40 Million Market cap this makes for an incredible investing opportunity.\n\nA  like-minded investor strongly believes In a bright future for $BLGO as well. I like his post  \u201cWHY BLGO MAY NOT REMAIN UNDERVALUED  AND  UNDISCOVERED MUCH LONGER\u201d\n\nAlso it is good to know that investors close to the company just invested hundreds of thousands of dollars more, directly into the company and just a couple days ago they announced that they signed contracts worth $ 1.2 Million within a couple of weeks.\n\nBTW-   don\u2019t forget that the BLGO CFO decided to solely get paid in options for the next years that have an exercise price around today\u2019s levels  (.174) That means you can currently buy shares cheaper than what the CFO will have to pay for shares - as his SOLE payment.\n\nFrom article:\n\n\\* Biden plan on removing PFAS from water and the environment is a  industrial high priority for the new administration\n\n\\*   Rosa Gwinn, PFAS leading expert for AECOM, gave a staggering figure  for  the total cost of global PFAS clean-up - Up to a trillion dollars   worldwide\n\n\\* BioLargo has   developed an unrivaled solution for PFAS removal that is low-cost,   high-efficacy with low carbon footprint that is called the AEC, Aqueous   Electrostatic Collector\n\n\\*  Testing  at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville showed that  BioLargo\u2019s AEC  PFAS Removal system removed over 99.995% of PFAS in a  single pass such  that less than one out of 50,000 PFAS molecules was  able to penetrate  the system\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhd9wo9prq871.png?width=1530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6a5ad35618ec6bc5936c7a4719da1e504c4850\n\n\\*  BioLargo has agreed  to install the AEC in pilot studies with large  industry users that could  lead to extraordinary revenues if trials are  successful\n\n\\*  AOS broad spectrum  water treatment system is low-cost, high-impact, and  is being delivered  to large users for pilot projects that could lead to  extraordinary  revenues\n\n\\* Disruptive odor control CupriDyne Clean being adopted by the biggest waste management companies in the world\n\n\\* World class environmental expert engineering division provides turnkey solutions for big industries\n\n\\* Disruptive disinfection products already approved 510K being readied for giant healthcare industry\n\n\\* Company is within a few months of achieving positive cash flow\n\n\\* Revenues setting record growth with very large potential for short and long term\n\n\\* Convertible debt is gone removing potential overhang selling from share market trading\n\n\\*   BLGO share price of $.18 with market cap of only $42 million.  Several   recent press releases point to an extraordinary sales potential  suggesting it may not be long before investors discover BLGO and revalue   share price\n\nBioLargo, Inc.   (BLGO: OTCQB) has been slugging it out for over a decade to develop broad-reaching technologies to improve water and air quality. Based on a   plethora of press releases and company communications through interviews, it appears that efforts are rapidly shifting from R&amp;D to commercialization that could generate unusually hefty revenues,   especially if the company executes big licensing deals with major partners. The long wait appears to be quickly fading in the rear-view  mirror, while the road just ahead is coming into clear focus as the shiny yellow brick road that management has been pursuing for a decade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBioLargo  shares may only trade at $.18 and support a very small market cap of about $43 million, but their products that are unrivaled in both cost and effectiveness are very close to starting what could be game-changing pilot studies for several large industries. The needs for BioLargo\u2019s products like the AOS and the AEC are so enormous that if the pilots are as successful as prior testing has demonstrated, the company revenues could surprise even the most optimistic forecasts.\n\nTiming is always a major factor in any investment decision. BioLargo has earned a good hard look by investors as it appears the long wait is finally over. The company is within weeks or just a couple of months of delivering game-changing products for major pilot studies to some very big users and markets that could have a big impact on the price of   BioLargo shares. Investors are encouraged to pour through a rich  offering of information about the company\u2019s technologies, management,   financials, products and news which is available on their homepage\n\nDennis   P. Calvert, President and CEO of BioLargo said, \"We are now in a  strong cash position, have reliable financing resources, and have retired all but $456,000 of our convertible debt. With our financial  condition  continuing to improve, our team of highly qualified  engineers,  scientists, and business professionals are uniquely  positioned to  commercialize our expanding portfolio of innovative  environmental  technologies, like our AEC system that removes PFAS  chemicals from  drinking water.\"\n\nAccording to  Environmental Business International, the market for PFAS  treatment,  which BioLargo's new AEC technology aims to address, will grow to be an  $80+ billion market in the US over the next few years,  and that there are more than 200 contaminated military sites which urgently require  PFAS remediation. Mr. Calvert commented, \"Our hard work to develop and commercialize an economical and eco-conscious solution to this huge problem puts us ahead of the curve to address this  burgeoning market.  Our PFAS remediation technology represents a  massive and timely  commercial opportunity, with its first commercial  pilots starting soon.\"\n\nFinancial highlights from the 10-Q:\n\n\\*   Consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was   $571,000, a 30% increase compared to the prior year's period.\n\n\\*   Due in large part to an almost 90% decrease in interest expense as a   result of payment and conversion of debt instruments, the company's net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2021, decreased by 28% as compared to the prior year's period.\n\n\\*   In 2021, the company has retired $650,000 in debt. Since December 31,   2019, the company has reduced its debt by over $3.6 million. Other than  debt owed by its partially owned subsidiary Clyra Medical, only SBA/PPP   loans and fixed-price convertible debt now remain on BioLargo's  balance sheet.

        "selftext": " \n\nFOREWARNING: I am aware that the great stock CLNE was apeified a little bit ago. This DD isn't about some crazy ladder climb short delta theta jump.\n\nHowdy,\n\nAs we all know, CLNE has been trading flatter than your wife for the better portion of a month now. However, I think that is all about to change. Also, I think it has actually been a good thing that the flatness has been getting tighter and tighter each day (seriously, CLNE moved like 5 cents back and forth today). Before I get into why it's about to run, here's some background on why CLNE is an amazing company (especially at $9).\n\n**WHAT THE FUCK DOES CLNE DO?:**\n\nClean Energy Fuels (CLNE) is in the business of creating Renewable Natural Gas out of organic waste. Cow shit (and other shit!). Renewable Natural Gas is one of the best bridges to move into green energy. EV's, Hydrogen, Solar, all are not prepared to power the worlds trucking fleets, despite their claims. They are in fact years away. It is exponentially cheaper to convert a long haul trucking rig to natural gas than to buy an EV rig. If you're an average trucker, your truck is where pretty much all your money and value is stored. It would be bonkers to buy a new EV vs to spend the $20,000 to convert your current rig to Nat gas.\n\nClean Energy Fuels already fuels more than 250,000 vehicles with RNG daily. This isn't some start up or nonsense gravity truck firm (looking at you NKLA). They have over 570 stations across North America already. CLNE is fervently building new stations at a breakneck pace. What that really amounts to is a substantial lead over any competitor. Which really means that you'd have to either use them or buy them out to try outpace them at their current rate.\n\nRenewable Natural Gas is good for the planet also (I know this is a stock presentation, what is the environment, but hold on). The current administration in the USA, and honestly the next ones too if they want the youth vote, are highly motivate to shift to green solutions. But they have to deal with the people who will drag their feet and won't want to spend millions on all new green solutions. RNG is the perfect bridge between the two. You can convert your trucks, your mail delivery fleet, whatever, all to RNG much cheaper than buying a new one. Renewable Natural Gas reduces carbon emissions, especially on big trucks) by a minimum of 70%. CLNE is committed to reducing that to 0 by 2025. This makes it highly likely to be chosen as a green solution. Methane is 20% of greenhouse gas emissions, so it's a double whammy, stopping two sources of pollution.\n\nFinally, CLNE already has contracts with big companies. The ever so touted Amazon contract is one of them. UPS already has a contract with them. They are the largest provider in California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program. People are coming aboard before they're forced to convert a much higher price (California especially is stopping a lot of non green shipping, but that's a whole other rabbit hole). There has been institutional buying of the stock over the past month and before, as these prices are a steal. WAIT WASN'T THERE A BIG SELL OFF EARLIER OMFG? That was Total taking a profit on their shares they bought for next to nothing years ago. It has already been announced over the twitter that they have stopped, as they just wanted to make sure they got a return on investment.\n\n**WHO GIVES A FUCK, WHY IS IT GONNA RUN?:**\n\nFirst, the technical. Now I am not the Adeptus Mechanicus, but apparently technical do something so I'll lay some out with my moronic knowledge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ao8wlyqeeva71.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79372a815c071300a27f39ac88545968e08b6982\n\nJust for fun, here's today. There's a little cup and handle there, I think.\n\nNow, over 6 months, something interesting comes out (yes I took this from Google, not all of us are billionaires who buy fancy crayon software):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5a3uo4nheva71.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=907c6e4bf44319fd07901680144bd82daf2bce02\n\nThere seems to be a cup and handle growing here too. It is also following a similar drop and spike pattern as from May to June, suggesting another upward jump coming.\n\nCLNE has consistently bounced off the 200 SMA, which suggests that that will stay a strong support. So $9 is a pretty safe entry point to buy some long dated options at, and a downright boomer safe entry point if you're buying shares. Over the last 6 months, we've stayed trading above $8, and really actually $8.50. With CLNE consistently growing, I don't see why we would drop past there.\n\nBut in reality, I don't speak stock robot, so technical aren't really my thing. Just my thoughts on the techs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sawts0akeva71.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=498b5bbd606be4ea2313092614a0f86d95bac941\n\nThere is a large amount of near the money options open on CLNE (someone once told me this doesn't matter because there's not as many as GE or Amazon. If you say something silly like that, you belong in the poorhouse).\n\nNow here is where there becomes two routes for CLNE to run. The first (the more unlikely, and the more ape like option tbf) is that CLNE starts to rally as it did near the June option expiry. This sent CLNE to a spike of $14.60 ish. If CLNE gains the interest of an institution looking to start getting foolish or becomes back in favor to fickle fools, then CLNE would already jump past where we we've been holding for weeks and your investment would already be profitable, or it would set up to become more profitable in the real run to come for July. Expiring option dates have generally been good to CLNE based on past performance.\n\nThe more realistic route is that the options all expire OTM. This seems bad (and indeed is for those option holders) but would actually still be good for CLNE. After we are finally away from an option expiry, CLNE can begin its run to August earnings. It has been announced that there will be a conference call immediately following the earnings report. Now, Clean Energy Fuels usually likes to wait to announce big deals for their earnings. They got very close with their Amazon deal to the May earnings call (15 ish days). That sent CLNE jumping up to the near 20's price. I think there is a high level of anticipation for this earnings call. While I personally believe a new contract will be announced (I think new, expanded UPS deal, but that's pure speculation so is not necessarily relevant in a DD, besides that is SEEMS like it'll happen haha), I think the belief of institutions and the average buyer that CLNE wants to announce a deal will cause CLNE to run up until earnings. CLNE already has received interest as a top trending stock on reddit, among other places, and the CEO went on Cramer and roused some interest there. There is also a suspicion that there might be more to the Amazon deal, as he stated that he couldn't go much more into it, as Amazon wanted to talk more about it. So, I think the belief of an Amazon deal or belief of a new contract will fuel CLNE to run until earnings. After earnings is anybody's guess, especially depending on the conference call. However, it is an easy run up to earnings, as I think most people (including analysts below) expect it to be pretty great. Also, with the temptation of a new contract, it will double the general excitement leading up to earnings.\n\nEarnings will also most likely be good. Most people panic at CLNE's past earnings with just a glance, but they almost always are 0.00 because they reinvest every penny into building more RNG stations, just furthering their lead in the sector. So even if CLNE holds on to 0.01 for the quarter, it will be gangbusters in terms of their earnings, which makes it very easy for CLNE to smash earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xo3of4meva71.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3363ca2c18ebd48e86c517dde7044826e9808607\n\nAnalysts have high projections for CLNE for the next 12 months.\n\nEven the lowest is $2 above close, and the median is $20. There is clear real belief in the stock besides just WSB think. Most analysts put it at a \"buy\" rating, because it is criminally undervalued.\n\n \n\n**TL;DR:** CLNE will have a a gangbusters run up to earnings after 7/16 options expire (or an even higher climb if they somehow expire ITM) due to sentiment and belief that CLNE will announce new contracts/have an even okay earnings report. CLNE is also an extremely safe bet at these levels as it has consistently held them. Personal price target: $18 the day before August 5th earnings.\n\n**POSITIONS:** 500 Shares, 80 ish September $20 calls, 5 7/16 $13 calls and 5 7/16 $12 calls (the July ones are just for fun FD gambling)",

Short Term: An Update\n\nThis is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.\n\nAnyway, the set-up is the same:\n\n* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.\n* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.\n* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual\n* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners\n* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two\n\n## Positions\n\nHere's what happened yesterday, Jun 7:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ryzbn23dk1a71...*\n\nHere's today (Jun 8) @ 2pm:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[As of Jun 8 @ 2:00 pm](https://preview.redd.it/27rv3txdk1a71.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85368ee2baa4981d737a831572dce16024a6379)\n\nThe IV remains low, with no bump up from [Tuesday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), because, congratulations, you guys didn't YOLO. Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.\n\n**Below is the updated chart:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)\n\nStill looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.\n\nLastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.\n\n\\---\n\n# IIa. Bananas\n\nImagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.\n\nHowever, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.\n\nAs the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.\n\nThe amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.\n\nThis continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**\n\n**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**\n\nYou see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!\n\nWhoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.\n\nThat's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.\n\n\\---\n\n# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.\n\nThis is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.\n\nBasically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**\n\n## Before: China sets the price of steel.\n\nChina enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 0y4yzy2hk1a71...*\n\nYeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.\n\nThey also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)\n\nWhile they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.\n\n## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.\n\nPart of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.\n\nIf you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**\n\nGiven the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)\n\nIf you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:\n\n&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China\u2019s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cSteel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,\u201d said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)\n\nYeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)\n\nIt's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.\n\n**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**\n\n1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)\n2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production\n3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel\n\n## China's walking the walk\n\nIt's not just talk, China is actually doing this.\n\n* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.\n* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.\n* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.\n* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.\n\n**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**\n\n\\---\n\n# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action\n\nBy now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.\n\n## How steel is made\n\nSteel has two primary pathways to its production:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img jt0bvemlk1a71...*\n\nNotice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)\n\n**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.\n\n## Cultural Appropriation\n\nIt's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):\n\n&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.\n\nThat's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**\n\n**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**\n\n&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.\n\nIn other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.\n\n\\---\n\n# IV. Scrapping over Scrap\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)\n\nSo:\n\n1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.\n2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.\n3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs\n4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.\n\n## The future fight for scrap\n\nThis whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.\n\nLourenco Goncalves, AKA \"steelmaker of the year 2021\", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:\n\n&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**\n\n[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.\n\nBasically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).\n\n## SCHN's take\n\nMeanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):\n\n&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.\n\nAlso:\n\n&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.\n\nThere are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)\n\nOf note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img zahlm9mok1a71...*\n\n**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**\n\n\\---\n\n# V. Catalysts\n\n## Short Term\n\n* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.\n* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.\n* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.\n* Steel earnings coming up. \ud83c\udf08 STEELGBTQ \ud83c\udf08 (steel goes big this quarter).\n\n## Long Term\n\nDespite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?\n\nSCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.\n\n# VI. That's all.\n\nI was not intending to go so hard on this DD but what can I say? I love you guys. Now, please, make me fucking rich.\n\nPositions, again:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[pls fly](https://preview.redd.it/qtaqlw1sk1a71.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83894bf578ec99a9383877bac17384b3ab6727a4)\n\nRecommended positions: The same as mine, obviously.\n\nTake care, and see you all in Part III, where I get more in depth about SCHN.",

He was joined by other plaintiffs in the suits, which were filed in federal court in Miami.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re demanding an end to the shadow-banning, a stop to the silencing and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing and canceling that you know so well,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, social media platforms are allowed to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services\u2019 own standards, so long as they are acting in \u201cgood faith.\u201d The law also generally exempts internet companies from liability for the material that users post.\n\nBut Trump and some other politicians have long argued that Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity \u2014 or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government.\n\nTrump was suspended from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube after his followers stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6. The companies cited concerns that he would incite further violence.\n\nNonetheless, Trump has continued to spread lies about the 2020 election, baselessly claiming that he won, even though state and local election officials, his own attorney general and numerous judges, including some he appointed, have said there is no evidence of the mass voter fraud he alleges.\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter all declined comment Wednesday.\n\nThe suits argue that banning or suspending Trump and the other plaintiffs is a violation of the First Amendment, despite the fact that the companies are private. The suit against Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook acted unconstitutionally when it removed Trump from the platform. Suits against Twitter and YouTube make similar claims. All three ask the court to award unspecified damages, declare Section 230 unconstitutional and restore Trump\u2019s accounts, along with those of the other plaintiffs \u2013 a handful of others who have all had posts or accounts removed.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s lawsuits are likely doomed to fail, said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University in California who has studied more than 60 similar, failed lawsuits over the past few decades that sought to take on internet companies for terminating or suspending users\u2019 accounts.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve argued everything under the sun, including First Amendment, and they get nowhere,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s got a trick up his sleeve that will give him a leg up on the dozens of lawsuits before him. I doubt it.\u201d\n\nGoldman said it\u2019s likely Trump is instead pursuing the suits to garner attention. As president, Trump last year signed an executive order challenging Section 230.\n\n\u201cIt was always about sending a message to their base that they\u2019re fighting on their behalf against the evil Silicon Valley tech giants,\u201d Goldman said.\n\nMatt Schruers, the president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a tech industry trade group that includes Facebook, Twitter and Google, said internet companies have a right to enforce their terms of service.\n\n\u201cFrivolous class action litigation will not change the fact that users \u2014 even U.S. Presidents \u2014 have to abide by the rules they agreed to,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\\_\\_ O\u2019Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

These are more likely to have a bullish outcome. However, this is on a longer timeframe. It would break up above **344** and targets **400 --&gt; 450 --&gt; 500.** You would want a daily close to seal the deal. This setup breaks down and is invalid below **163,** from there - no support until **145.**\n\n**(TEAL)**\n\nDescending channel coming from downside. This are bearish in nature. It means the near term trend is down and likely to stay that way unless we break above the upper boundary with a daily close. In this case, you would need a break above **209,** which would target **241.26, 274.29, 291.30 -** and **maybe** the top of the pattern at **344.** Until then, it is sell the rip short term.\n\nWhen a pattern breaks against it's bias - the resulting move is often less pronounced and I look for about half the move I would look for if it broke with it's bias. That's why in this scenario, if we broke above, you would want to see it form a **bull flag, falling wedge, or ascending triangle (continuation pattern)** to get that true follow through to the far end.\n\nThis breaks down with the red setup below that **163** level.\n\n(**YELLOW)**\n\nThese are price levels on the 1 year chart. They are as follows from top to bottom - **291.30, 274.29, 241.26, 205.49, 189.66.** Below, they are resistance. Above, they are support. Under the pattern, support is **145.00, 100.00.**\n\nMoving onto $AMC -\n\n[$AMC 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/xn42mhw5v1b71.png?width=2233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7785ff88f6b50dedbc23436c5b235dad4ae3e759)\n\n**(RED)**\n\nWith that large bounce on **7/8 -** this has actually become a **falling wedge.** These are **bullish** in nature. That being said, we are obviously in danger of breaking it down today. For that to not happen, we must hold **38.54** on every daily close, sloping down each day. Below, **the setup is invalid** and nearby support is at **36.77** and **33.61.**\n\nThe pattern breaks up on a daily close above **55.00** sloping down each day. Price targets for the breakout would be **65.10, 75.00, 100.00.**\n\n**(YELLOW)**\n\nThese are price levels on the 1 year chart. They are as follows from top to bottom - **65.10, 61.18, 51.00, 36.77, 33.61, 20.46, 16.79.** There is a few more but they are so far away there is no reason to plot them. I try to keep my charts as clean as possible.\n\nNote the gap at **33.61 -** this is also one of the most important supports on the chart. Gaps like to be filled, and it's likely we do fill this one.\n\nRemember a breakdown is always confirmed by a candle close on it's respective chart, in this case the daily. For that reason, we could see a candle wick under - fill the gap - wick back over. A close under that level would be very unhealthy and likely mark a move back to **20.46.** This is the highest probability point to go short.\n\n\\---\n\n*Keep in mind technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. I'm providing the most high probability entries &amp; exits - with the most favorable risk/reward ratios. I am not making an absolute prediction of future prices.*\n\n*Not Financial Advice*",

        "selftext": "Im an engineer, but Im also an idiot.  I literally almost flunked out cuz i was too dumb. I ended up in construction because i couldnt do anything else engineering related.  Take this opinion at your own risk because I might be talking out of my ass.  \n\nI'm in construction, specifically on the municipality side (yea im *that* city worker) so I'm the one administering the federal infrastructure funds at the ground level. To date I've administered millions in federal funds on \"infrastructure\". Infrastructure is by definition the least sexiest thing.  Everyone shits, but we'd all prefer to not deal with it, that's infrastructure.  Here are a bunch of very common sense reasons why this isnt going to cash in. \n\n* I see a lot of posts about steel, concrete and other raw materials.  Clearly these are from people who know fuck all about infrastructure.  I'd argue that if you're looking to invest into Biden's infrastructure plan you should be looking at the other end of this supply chain.  Who do you think is more profitable, the no name company that supplies the raw material for 1 component of an iphone or Apple? If youre looking to jump onto the infrastructure bandwagon, I'd be looking at construction companies or engineering firms.\n* But companies are also not a great bet. contractors and trades are specialized.  The company that paves the street is not the same one that does traffic signal upgrades.  An electrician is not going to do laborers work.  Large companies will need(either by choice or requirement) to subcontract out certain specialized portions thus diluting overall tendies. not to mention that profits are capped.  markup % is often literally defined.  \"Oh no Mr. Contractor you have a problem?  fuck you, sucks to be you\" (this is one of my favorite parts of the job). Not to mention that projects are parsed to all the states and from there into certain sizes in order to further dilute the tendies.  State and local governments may have additional requirements that even further dilute the tendies.  The government is trying boost an industry and the economy at large, not a few companies.  The literal idea of the plan is to trickle money across the country.  If you look at this fountain that slowly trickles down, if you place your cup in any one spot you're just gonna get a few drops. \n* Infrastructure means nothing because it means everything.  It could be streetlight poles in which case steel is very very relevant, or it could be a fucking sidewalk in which case steel is not important at all. If you just open your eyes when you go outside (huge ask i know) you will see that infrastructure is extremely varied. \n* Many of us with ties to the industry are feeling delays and back orders, but this is logistics related.  These issues were around before the infra plan and will remain after. I think the idea behind these \"DDs\" on raw materials is because they think this infrastructure plan will increase demand on an already limited supply thus driving prices and profits up.  Nevermind the contracting aspect of this money(a lot of it is fixed for a certain amount of time), Supply and demand still rules, but solving the global supply chain logistics will also increase supply. The supply chain logistical issues are a larger and more importantly, independent, factor.  \n* Also surprise surprise Biden's infrastructure plan, while maybe bigger, isnt special. Trump had infrastructure plans and so did Obama.  Infrastructure is ALWAYS happening.  As i said, everyone shits and it doesnt stop.  Infrastructure never stops, you can try to clench your sphincter closed and it'll work for a lil while, but eventually you shit.  Its the same thing with infrastructure spending.  Biden's plan is not the big demand surge people think it is. \n* I think a lot of people underestimate the timescale of infrastructure.  it takes time to build shit and it takes even more time to renovate shit cuz you cant just blow it up and start over. Most people cannot shit on command and those that can dont do it instantly. This aint China.  We're not gonna build a covid hospital in 48 hours( mostly cuz our work isnt made out of garbage tofu-strength concrete but that is another topic). This shit is going to take YEARS. I will see Biden infrastructure money at my level 1-2 years from now and will start spending it 3-5 years from now. Think about this, after the money is secured someone gotta design the damn thing, someone gotta the draw the picture so my dumbass who cant read can knows what is supposed to be built.  Those assholes always fuck up too and they are the smart ones!!!  This isnt even mentioning how raw material suppliers, product suppliers, construction companies, design firms, are only a part of this timescale. \n* One dude can only use 1 shovel at at time, can operate one piece of equipment at a time. The pipe maker can only make pipes so fast and those pipes can only be installed so fast.  There is no exponential factor in infrastructure like there is in tech.  An app can be downloaded millions of times in a single night. You only shit one poop at a time. \n\nTl;dr.  Infrastructure is like pooping. Everyone does it, it is always happening. Trying to cash in on infrastructure is trying to cash in on pooping. You can only poop so fast and so much, the supply demand is capped. You only shit one poop at a time.  Sure you get diarrhea sometimes but even then it has its limits. You cant cash in on analogous dry heaves. Infrastructure is regular, so in the long term investing in this industry is probably a smart move.  As long as humans are alive they are going to shit and if there are more humans tomorrow than there are today then there will be more shit, but if that is your tendie making strategy why are you even here?",

The pandemic is slowly but surely ending and the reopening plays have been printing. Now, as people are forced to go back to their offices and wage slave for pennies thanks to the thousands they lost on meme yolo's..... they're going to need new pants to fit over their fat asses that have increased in size due to the cyclical nature of ordering takeout alone and becoming more depressed.\n\nYou all know this too well, but I'll illustrate this complex process for the extra-retarded among us:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdhuc1v6fsa71.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63fe722521d99bfea65cf3846dca7dfd624dbc9d\n\n*^(I know what you're thinking... \"I'm in this photo and I don't like it.\")*\n\n# Levi's, the pandemic, and recovery:\n\nBasically, in 2020 everyone started staying home all the time and no one wore pants. I can confirm because I personally did not wear jeans for at least 8 months. That new found casual glory was reflected in Levi's sales. **However, Levi's has seen an accelerated recovery** that has beaten even their own already increased expectations, *and exceeded pre-covid performance*. The average weight gain over the course of the pandemic was something like 22 pounds; waistlines are growing faster than the blue jean gods could have possibly anticipated.\n\n**Just today, Morgan Stanley increased their price target by almost 50% to $40 per share.**\n\nLooking at Levi's most recent earnings data, from this past week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/833fhb2afsa71.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e80e95bfa4a6128d8b6f19c756c627a0988f952a\n\nHere's a look at 2021 vs 2020:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bnjrv3vbfsa71.png?width=1714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c61679e31c481cd11846c490f8c1731fb6a11f2\n\nAll over the globe Levi's sales numbers have been soaring:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d6hc3elcfsa71.png?width=1713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3e112219f06edf7302de1476140678dadd69f08\n\nWhy? This increased fatness (and trust me this surprised me too) isn't just limited to America:\n\n[Leading the fucking way, of course, as is tradition.](https://preview.redd.it/nakbk0wdfsa71.png?width=1516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=532d8b5554b58bcc68ba29df9af97f24b7eb1027)\n\n# \"They sell pants and I'm fat, I get it. What's the point.\"\n\nAgain, focusing on earnings, there are some stark similarities in the charts and performance that lead me to believe we are due for a run up here. Let's compare the last 2 earnings cycles and the 10 days immediately following the report. Last earnings on left, this earnings on right (note the chart position relative to the top and bottom channel lines for future reference):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqdt93lgfsa71.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea3c3f07a76e3cd47c1ae2f253a67b6b24629a62\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62hqxidhfsa71.png?width=1078&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92e507a39733c537dccfb79fbf5a436249376af9\n\nI went with a 10% guess for the run up this time, just because the spike wasn't *as* impressive. However what you also have to consider here is that the stock is currently riding in the bottom of it's channel where's it's been comfortably consolidating for *6 weeks:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aijfi02mfsa71.png?width=2178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b33e10724f9ecce4e86d91b663f64e646948da29\n\nI get an extra boost of confidence by the stock recovering from that dip and settling right back into the previous pattern. This channel actually extends well beyond the last 6 weeks shown above. Below, you'll see the consistency of this ride dating back to October of 2020:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yomw1ymnfsa71.png?width=2185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9541576632bcc3aa42c2bb5a94959dc6c5ae40b\n\n# \"Stonks go up, duh. How to make money without buying pants?\"\n\nNothing can replace the years of life we've lost ordering door dash every time we get sad. One thing we can do, though, is make decent \"investing\" decisions to print more money and allow us to continue our self-destructive habits. LEVI has a universal buy rating among the analysts who've rated it and price targets range from +12% to +40%. Looking at the charts, again with the earnings cycles as our focal point:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/af8jv0bpfsa71.png?width=2184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61479f4ffe48c16858f25f4c186080b9ad5b67e1\n\nThe horizontal line on that chart is $30. The first 2 vertical lines are earnings reports. The third vertical line is August expiry. I think we see a return to the upper half of the channel before then, and I think we see it in the next 10 days - 2 weeks. **This is not financial advice, my mom only buys me Velcro, off-brand jeans because my brain can't do buttons, zippers scare me, and I soil pants frequently.**\n\n# TL;DR - Levi's smashed earnings again, and is currently riding nice and smooth at the bottom of its long-term channel. Last earnings it ran up 15% after the initial spike/sell off and it's poised to do the same. People got fatter, too much takeout = new pants, calls on cholesterol.\n\nSee you on the moon.\n\nCheers\n\nPositions:\n\n* Active:  \n\n   * Aug 20th $28 C's\n   * Aug 20th $30 C's\n   * Shares\n* Adding:  \n\n   * Jan '22 $35 C's\n   * Shares\n* Risky business  \n\n   * 1-2 steps out of the money, July 16th C's\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uenqqhnrfsa71.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a772d0a38b8692df2eed3f4e67cbdcfa0e55e168",

        "selftext": " I truly HATE what has happened to WSB due to the whole FUCKING meme stock revolution.  \n\nInstead of just being happy with ourselves for unexpectedly making bank with TSLA, AMC, GME, et al, many of us thought we were suddenly geniuses.  \n\nAnd many of those who weren't IN on those parties the first time wanted to be THE NEXT TIME!! \n\nWe also got a reputation in the Media for thinking outside the box AND acting in CONCERT to MOVE STOCKS. (In other words something very close to PUMPING!)\n\n     \nThe sub got FLOODED with new people, many of whom were just plain GREEDY and/or STUPID, and many of whom broke the rules. Who weren't FUNNY. Who didn't have anything of value to share. Who wanted just to PUMP their own stock.  Mods were busy night and day trying to keep it reasonable.\n\n All other types  of formerly interesting and often very valuable discussions started to subside. And with it, a very WONDERFUL, and rare good-humor. After called each other names, we actually REACHED OUT WITH KINDNESS to those of us who were experiencing loss or some other trouble. Increasingly, to me at least, it has become less kind, and interesting, and a lot more venal.\n\nIn the last few days, have you seen what is happening to the AMC subs? Its partisans are all on an **ALEX JONES-LEVEL** **CRUSADE** against all the ***im******aginary enemies*** that are ***secretly manipulating*** the prices downward. **NEVER MIND THE STOCK WAS $1.92** on January 1st for good reasons, and could reasonably be expected to return to earth at some point...NOoooo! \n\nThere were 'investigative reports' about illegal naked shorts and fake shares. People started taking it all WAY TOO  SERIOUSLY. They put their student loan money on it, they could barely wait for Friday so they could put their checks on it.  One guy used the fact that he needs to take care of his handicapped mom to put ALL of his money on it.  It now is an ALL OUT WAR against some fuck named Kenny who is supposedly masterminding all this evil. And the only way to fight it is to BUY MORE STOCK.\n\n First of all, it's NOT a conspiracy. Or if it is, we should acknowledge that WE ALSO ARE A CONSPIRACY, okay?ot. But even if it were, how is it effective to just SIT THERE AND LET THEM KEEP CONSPIRING AGAINST YOU??!! I mean, the more you prove you can't win, the more you should just LEAVE THE FUCKING GAME, No? But I am actually worried somebody is going to get HURT  by this. It's TOO SERIOUS,  GUYS. IT HAS TO STOP!!       **I don't want**  **Sept 11 NIHILISM IN MY SUBREDDIT, OKAY?!**\n\nHere's what I think...we need to stop being the fucking 'meme stock promoter boys' and go back to being the 'hidden opportunity exploiters', the class clowns, etc. \n\n I'm pretty much a permabear anyway, and don't try to hide it, but I get yelled at, banned, and called a 'shill' and a lot of other shit for trying to TELL PEOPLE who are not experienced that **WE ARE NOT HERE TO ENDLESSLY PROMOTE MEME STOCKS whose time has GONE.**\n\nSo, I PROPOSE we start SHORTING meme stocks, or buying puts on them. I've made like 60% on my admittedly tiny portfolio in the last 2 days with puts on AMC. I'M  GONNA START RUBBING IT INTO YOUR GREEDY APE ASSES, TOO!!\n\n     \nWhich reminds me.  I am kinda SICK of this APE motif, too. It's so OVER-DONE. Fuck, I didn't VOTE for that! Now all the media is calling us that. Okay, you idiots that want to pretend you are too dumb to care about the valuation of stock but want to call anybody who disagrees with you a SHILL, You be the APES!!  I don't even remember what we were BEFORE. OH YEAH....WE USED TO BE AUTISTS, REMEMBER?\n\n But would we stay on the NEWS, with CNBC counting how many times we mentioned 'blubber' if they had to refer to us a AUTISTS??  NOOOO!! Chad and Veronica would WRITE ANGRY EMAILS to REDDIT. No, we had to TONE IT DOWN. So we became nice, SOFT, friendly apes. Lots of poo and banana joke material there. AH HAHAHAHAHA!! So VERY funny, those apes.\n\nI want Bears, Shorts and AUTISTS to have EQUAL RESPECT. Do you hate Hedge Funds?  GREAT!!! Make a case for us SHORTING THEM and maybe we will do it.  But don't get your damn knickers in a twist if I don't give a shit about your grandma not being able to afford a new colostomy bag because I refuse to help pump your fucking worthless meme stock, **ASSHOLE!!** \n\nAnd if your being TOO DUMB to understand that WHAT GOES UP MUST **EVENTUALLY** GO TITS UP, then good riddance, Monkey Boy!!  FUCK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH!!",

The volume on $WISH was insane and was constantly being pumped &amp; dumped. A lot of people who bought this initially at 10$ sold it at 12$ and got back in between $12.5 to $14.5. If you look at Ebay, Overstock, Etsy, Jmia, Amazon - You'll notice a simple trend. All of these stocks got dumpstered really hard before they mooned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EBAY** \n\nIf you look at this chart, you'll notice how in 2009 and 2018 Ebay took a huge dip.

This stock went from 15$ to 65$ within a period of 6 months. I know WISH cannot be compared with Amazon, but it can definitely be compared with JMIA. WISH and JMIA have pretty similar chart except WISH hasn't mooned to $69 yet and JMIA has.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fyblai46lcb71.png?width=2136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adddea2c354ae2017d48fbf8445df1ee22f2dcb7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ETSY**  \n$WISH can be compared to ETSY as well. This company was trading around $25 after their IPO and then later on went as low as 15$. Look at the current price of ETSY now  - This stock is trading at $182 a piece. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6r69dysllcb71.png?width=2138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e068c48ea964a0fef3a585fd8087a3e3f59b213\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OVERSTOCK**  \nThis company was trading at 65$ in 2018 and dropped to 10$ in 2019. This is pre covid by the way so pandemic and covid had no impact on the stock price. I am not taking covid into consideration for any of the dips because it's an outlier. This company is currently trading at ATH as well ($80/piece). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlbwdki4mcb71.png?width=2142&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f66a40105bfbf2de0fdf07f397855b392f639e0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now let's talk about Warren Buffet** \n\nA random person from audience asked buffet how can he turn 10K$ into 30B$ in today's world. \n\nMr Buffet replied \"Find small companies and invest in them, make sure to invest in companies that have a good future\". I believe we have found such company and that company is $WISH.   \nHere's the video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy0tXMtZGCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy0tXMtZGCA)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***How do I paper hand? My wife goes for a sleepover to her boyfriend's house everyday because I don't bring enough tendies?***\n\nHere are my few tips   \n1) You need to forget this stonk for few months.\n\n2) Think of it as an investment or savings into T bills.\n\n3) Don't keep looking at your position.\n\n4) Average down by selling weekly covered calls. \n\n5) If you have 10K$ invested in WISH then you can probably make around 100$/week selling OTM covered calls. Think of it as a passive income. Let's say you buy a house and the value of the house falls. Do you then instantly end up selling the house? No you don't. You instead rent out a bedroom and constantly collect monthly payments. The idea of covered calls is very similar to that. It's a passive income. \n\n6) Delete Robinhood\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion -**   \nAll e-commerce websites have taken a huge dip after IPO (LIKE HUGE) and then recovered. The dips on the company I mentioned were worse than WISH. I wouldn't be surprised if WISH trades at 6$/piece for a while.   \nDo not PAPER hand this company. The company has a potential to shoot up to 60-100$+ if you have some patience. If you're down a lot then consider selling weekly covered calls but make sure your strike price is higher than your avg cost.  \nThe company has a lot of CASH and a lot of Revenue. I am sure they got something up on their sleeves. A lot of institutions and top wall street analysts are holding this stonk. There's no way it doesn't go up.",

        "selftext": "I know Workhorse has been mentioned a lot on this board (&amp; it deserves to be!) This company in the tail-end of 2021 and 2022 will truly breakout. I believe much of Wall Street only considers WKHS as yet another EV company (which explains the high short %) but it's so much more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDrones:\n\nToward the end of this year, Workhorse will likely gain FAA approval for their drone usage. This is monumental as not only a first-mover in the space but as a company that has been testing with federal/[local governments](https://dronelife.com/2021/06/08/nuair-leads-the-way-for-safe-drone-operations-over-people-workhorse-and-avss-collaboration/) and [UPS](https://www.fleetowner.com/covid-19-coverage/article/21129382/ups-and-workhorse-test-drones-to-help-covid19-response). UPS has been testing Workhorse drones for about 5 years now as they are preparing to get into drone delivery - in fact, they have purchased [950 trucks](https://www.trucks.com/2018/06/14/ups-order-950-workhorse-electric-delivery-trucks/). With Workhorse's PATENTED drone technology to fit their electric truck landing space, this will be a huge asset to the company. I digress, back to drones. Ark Invest  estimates that at some point during the next five years, drones will deliver more than 20% of parcel shipments (image attached). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRefrigerated Trucks:\n\n Online food delivery sales grew more than 40% globally in 2020. As of their last earnings call, Workhorse announced that they will begin prototypes for refrigerated delivery trucks this year.  Workhorse was approached by some LARGE companies inquiring about the possibility of a REFRIGERATED version of their giant 1000 cubic foot Zero Emission Electric Step Van the C-1000.  The Workhorse COO is the former Director of Fleet Operations for Sysco, whose 14,000 vehicle fleet is largely 1000 cubic ft Refrigerated Trucks.  Their HQ is right next to Kroger's HQ btw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, I think Workhorse is in the first inning of their growth stage right now. I truly see this stock retesting its highs by early next year. There are a lot of first mover advantages and spaces where there is NO competition. As they continue to develop, go through the legal processes and progress their product line, they will gain market share and big name customers. WE HAVE THE PATENT FOR DRONE PACKAGE DELIVERY FROM A VEHICLE. Hold strong fellas",

IVAS ARMY update after user jury discussion on Jul 12 \n2. ER date announcement \n3. Q2 2021 results \n4. IAA Show on September \n\nAlso July 12 2021 we had an 8-k filed for CFO Steve holt\n\nThe Role of a CFO in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions\n\nOnce a company has narrowed down a list of counterparties (either potential buyers, investors or acquisition targets), or has entered the transaction phase, the CFO\u2019s role transforms into chief negotiator \u2013 making sure the company achieves the best deal possible. Both seller and buyer want to maximize synergy to make sure they\u2019re extracting the most a deal can financially offer. It\u2019s critical during this stage that CFOs from both sides maintain open communication about acquisition conditions, growth potentials, and other financial targets that will make the deal a success.\n\nAs these negotiations progress and the end of a transaction nears, the CFO must simultaneously create a comprehensive integration plan that will be ready for execution the moment a deal ends.\n\n 90,000 RSU's awarded to Holt, transferable upon change of control? $200k bonus payable NOW?\n\n$140M ATM to show a stronger balance sheet to potential partners and customers?\n\n\nhttps://www.uts.edu.au/sites/default/files/article/downloads/ACCDG_Spr15Sem_HSpiropoulos.pdf\n\nUsing a sample of U.S. firms during the period 2003-2012, we examine whether M&amp;As impact the compensation of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in the bidding and integration phases of M&amp;As. Our findings indicate that CFOs total compensation is higher in the year of acquisition relative to all other CFOs. The higher total compensation of CFOs is driven by higher equity incentives. Furthermore, CFOs receive a greater proportion of their compensation in the form of equity during and immediately after the year of acquisition. We also investigate if CFO compensation during M&amp;A years is driven by M&amp;A characteristics. We find that CFO compensation is higher in M&amp;A years when; the deal size is larger, the time to completion is shorter, and when the target firm has a different 2-digit SIC code. CFO compensation is not associated with the short term change in the acquiring firms share price.\n\n\nHere\u2019s a picture of microvision point cloud compared to Tesla point cloud \n\n\nAlso looks like waymo is looking to incorporate a \u201cnew Lidar\u201d system for their robo taxis \n\nWaymo to integrate new LIDAR into the autonomous driving system for Level 4 autonomous driving ?\n\n[https://waymo.com/joinus/3218427/](https://waymo.com/joinus/3218427/)\n\n* **Design and implement data and control flow needed to integrate new LIDAR into the autonomous driving system**\n* **Develop, deploy, and optimize custom hardware drivers**\u00a0\n* **Develop novel calibration processes involving multiple sensors and actuation stages in the loop**\n* **Analyze data collected from sensor systems, and develop tools to help do so**\n* **Support sensor manufacturing by customizing existing systems to improve test integration, assembly tracking, and reporting pipelines**\n* **FPGA programming and supporting ASIC development teams**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sp4ya65s9ma71.png?width=1319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e15318ab7bc956f88754c541f486b07eca4c392\n\nWhat i found additionally interesting is Microvision has two new software development requirement opened up.

        "selftext": "**Valuation: Undervalued**\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Technologies Inc Investment Summary:***\n\n\u00b7 Recently, there has been a lot of excitement around Palantir, however, very few people actually understand what they do and how they operate. As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactly what Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now.\n\no I am no data engineer, so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does, some of my interpretations may be off, so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong.\n\n\u00b7 Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent, Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long-term hold.\n\no The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports, and any news that may come out.\n\n\u00b7 It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is, which is why my investment plan (found in the \u201cplan\u201d section) is different than usual.\n\no There are various risks to this investment (like there are to every investment), these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the \u201crisks\u201d section.\n\no Additionally, there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir\u2019s share price, both in the short and long term(s). These catalysts are listed at the end of this report.\n\n***Overview of Palantir as a Company:***\n\n[$PLTR - Palantir Technologies Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/PLTR) was founded in 2003 (after their fear/anger after the events observed through 9/11) and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible. At this point in time, Palantir\u2019s only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts.\n\nHowever, since that point in time, Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises, as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications. Now, Palantir\u2019s revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts.\n\n*Palantir has 2 main software platforms, Palantir \u201cGotham\u201d, and Palantir \u201cFoundry\u201d.*\n\n[**Palantir Gotham**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/) was their first software platform and was designed for defense/intelligence use cases. Palantir has stated that this kind of platform helps agencies find \u201cneedles in thousands of haystacks\u201d. They also noted that [Gotham helped soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact-Study-Palantir-Defense-During-Drawdown.pdf) to map networks of bomb makers and insurgents through deep/hidden patterns and datasets, helping the army save time and lives. Since this mission, Gotham has expanded into defense operations and mission planning. During this time, Palantir found that Gotham could also be applied in Airbus\u2019 business, as their planes require millions of parts, assembled in multiple factories in different countries. However, Palantir decided to make another software platform that is better tailored to commercial enterprises, this platform was labelled \u201cPalantir Foundry\u201d.\n\n[**Palantir Foundry**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) transforms the way in which organizations interact with their information by creating a central operating system for their data. Palantir enables their customers to construct their own models quickly and easily from countless sets of data points.\n\nPalantir software is used by their 139 Government and Commercial Institutions/enterprises, in over 40 industries, ranging over 150 countries. Palantir works with the US Government and their several allies abroad, as well as the worlds most important/reliable companies.\n\nLastly, Palantir has stated \u201cWe are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build the software that enable our customers to integrate their own data that they already have.\u201d\n\n***Everything you need to know about Palantir and $PLTR:***\n\n*Palantir Foundry:*\n\nFoundry is essentially a [data warehouse](https://panoply.io/data-warehouse-guide/the-difference-between-a-database-and-a-data-warehouse/) that helps their commercial customers to collect and analyze their data. Foundry\u2019s platform includes a [graphical data interface](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface) that is extremely user friendly allowing their customers to get the most out of their data. Furthermore, Foundry provides statistical analyses through the use of their [AI machine learning](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/ai-ml/) networks that are able to consistently deliver efficient and accurate results.\n\nFoundry helps to enables all of their users, regardless of their technical abilities, to work meaningfully and act with the data that they collect. Foundry provides a suite of applications that help combine data analytics and business logic, helping them to deliver superior data integration.\n\nFoundry\u2019s front-end (what the user sees) enables their users to take advantage of all of the data collected by their organization to make informed decisions. Foundry also has a fantastic application for inter-organizational collaboration, this helps a team to build on each others work.\n\n*Foundry brings all of an enterprises data together onto their platform, however there are access controls in place to define what individuals get control over which dataset(s). From there, Foundry is able to deliver advanced analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company\u2019s data, make quality insights, so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage.*\n\n**Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite.**\n\n*Palantir Gotham:*\n\nDubbed \u201cThe Operating System for Government Decision Making\u201d, Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations.\n\nGotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government, to help them find what they are looking for. Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life. This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real-world responses to threats that Gotham identifies. Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies.\n\nThere is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham, which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with. However, what we do know is that these organizations have re-signed contracts with Palantir, which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly \u201cthe real deal\u201d.\n\nLastly, Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers, primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries. Furthermore, [Palantir has been credited](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2015/01/12/leaked-documents-bernie-madoff-convicted-thanks-to.html) with assisting in finding the largest Ponzi scheme ever (Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi Scheme).\n\n*Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place. Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data, and key patterns, so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats/problems they face in real-time.*\n\n*Palantir\u2019s Approach:*\n\nPalantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis, and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data.\n\nPalantir recognises that other companies sell features, tools, applications, and/or dashboards, however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run (if at all). Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software/platform to have sustainable, reliable, and safe data solutions.\n\nPalantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large \u201cfarms\u201d of data provided by each of their client companies. By doing this, Palantir is able to feed more data/information into their machine learning, AI, and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient. This also enables [cross-industry data pools](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU), that can be used by their companies when they look to expand or for opportunities in other verticals.\n\n*Palantir Success Stories:*\n\n**BP:**\n\nPerhaps the most notable success story that has come from Palantir is their partnership with [$BP \u2013 British Petroleum](https://utradea.com/stocks/BP)\n\nBP and Palantir have been partners since 2014, and recently (February 2021) [BP and Palantir have extended their partnership](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/05/palantir-deepens-ties-with-bp-with-new-5-year-deal/) for 5 more years. Palantir has helped BP to transform their business into a more digital one, and this extension of their partnership will ensure a further acceleration of their strategic digitization of their business.\n\nPalantir\u2019s Foundry has already helped BP by streamlining and enhancing their hydrocarbon-based workflows. Palantir helped BP to analyze their drilling data and has helped them to [increase their oil production in the North Sea by over 10%.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/palantir-the-tech-spooks-who-found-bin-laden-are-helping-bp-find-oil-9qddfpv2r)\n\nThis increase in production helps us to visualize just how useful Palantir\u2019s software can be. This is why their Foundry has been credited as a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d. Other oil producing companies most likely would not have been able to uncover the data, patterns, and relationships that were uncovered by Palantir, thus the companies that are not using Palantir may be losing out.\n\nThis type of publicity is fantastic for Palantir, as companies may see this, and contact Palantir because they too want a competitive advantage. Palantir\u2019s best chance at becoming the next \u201ctech giant\u201d comes through the commercial applications/contracts. This is because there are infinite uses for Palantir, so theoretically, they can get it in the hands of every business (which would help revenues to soar).\n\n**National Institute of Health (NIH) and Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS):**\n\nPalantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE. However, recently Palantir has been getting good press, which has helped their company image. Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir, for Palantir\u2019s assistance with their fights against COVID-19, and their vaccine distributions. This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID-19.\n\nThe NIH agreed to a [$36M contract](https://www.palantir.com/pt_media/nih-palantir-contract/) to gain a partnership with Palantir. Their (NIH\u2019s), mission is to build the largest centralized COVID-19 patient database in the world, and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success.\n\nPalantir was able to assist the NIH in building their [N3C data platform](https://covid.cd2h.org/). This platform has come a long way since they teamed up with Palantir, and now has over 7.1B rows of data from 6.5M patients, from 57 different databases. Without the assistance of Palantir, analyzing this amount of data would have been no easy feat, however Palantir has provided the NIH with advanced analytics in the matter of minutes thank to their machine learning capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, in December of 2020, Palantir signed a [2-year $31.5M deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201223005018/en/Palantir-Continues-Vital-NHS-Work-With-31.5M-Contract) with the Brittan\u2019s NHS. This partnership requires Foundry to provide a secure, reliable, and timely platform to process data, while protecting patient privacy, to ultimately improve patient care.\n\nBoth of these partnerships highlight the need for Palantir during a crisis and having these large Government Health Institutes choosing Palantir as their first options is a great deal, and shows their confidence in Palantir\u2019s software.\n\n*Sources:*\n\n[The power of data in a pandemic - Technology in the NHS (blog.gov.uk)](https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/28/the-power-of-data-in-a-pandemic/)\n\n*Strengths:*\n\n**Built-in Privacy Controls:**\n\nBy having [privacy controls](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU) in place, Palantir is able to operate in places that other data companies cannot go. This is especially true for Foundry, where companies/individuals can request cross-industry data from other Palantir clients to help them in a variety of ways. This request for external data needs to be accepted by a representative of the other company to be allowed. This helps Palantir leverage all of the data that they have on their \u201cOperating System\u201d, which essentially makes their platform a cross-company/cross-country collaborative workspace for all. As Palantir attains more clients, the more attractive/extensive their database is for potential clients. This should help Palantir to expand quickly once they get the ball rolling.\n\nPalantir truly values this privacy and has integrated data legibility, audit logs, access controls, quality checks and requirements to attain external data.\n\n**Government Grade Security:**\n\nAs we know, Palantir started out in just the defense and intelligence spaces. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the get-go. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This is no easy feat, however Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients, because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has [IL-5 clearance](https://simplemoneylyfe.com/palantir-stock-analysis/) with the Department of Defense (DoD), which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance (alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP). However, it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of **classified information.**\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.\n\n**Expansion into the Commercial Sector:**\n\nPalantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector, partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry.\n\nPalantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization/operations. Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector, and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises.\n\n*Government Contracts:*\n\nDo you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling? If so, you will know where I am headed with this section.\n\nBetween 2008-2018 (10 years), Palantir was able to generate $51.9M in revenue from government contracts. However, in the 2 years following this they earned $179.9M in Government contracts (this can be found under the \u201cUS Government\u201d section of their [SEC 10-K report](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)). Once Palantir was able to get the ball rolling with these agencies, Palantir was able to both expand and renew existing contracts to earn more revenue. I believe that the same thing will happen with Palantir\u2019s commercial operations. Once they start to get a large number of big enterprises renewing their contracts for \u201cbigger bucks\u201d, I believe that Palantir will start to grow their revenues extremely quick and attract new clients \u201cleft, right, and center\u201d.\n\nThese contract renewals are so important because essentially, they mean that Palantir met and/or exceeded expectations, and these companies now believe that Palantir is vital to their business/operations, so look out for news around renewals.\n\n*Business Model:*\n\nPalantir has developed a business model that focuses on acquiring contracts and expanding their services and has 3 main phases.\n\n1. **Acquire Customers:** Palantir has expanded their sales force largely over the past couple of years, and actively purse negotiations with companies that they can provide long-term value to. To acquire these companies, Palantir gives them a short demo to see how effective and user friendly their software is, Palantir provides this service for a loss. However, they are willing to incur these (proportionately) small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies. This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase.\n2. **Expand:** Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook, they move them along to the expand phase. Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes, of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it. These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost (Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well), however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir\u2019s software during this phase and see what it has to offer. If they like their software, they will be moved along to the next phase (scale) which is Palantir\u2019s bread and butter.\n3. **Scale:** These clients tend to sign longer-term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a \u201cgood feel\u201d for their software. The companies in this stage are also generally \u201chands-off\u201d meaning that they can operate the software without much help. Companies tend to find the most value in this stage, and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage. In 2020, Palantir made $613.4M in this stage with a margin of 70%\n\n*Financial information:*\n\nAll of this information can be found in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Palantir increased their gross profit by 47.97% and increased their gross margin to 81% (from 71%), Palantir reported their first net income (excluding stock-based compensation) ever and increase their net revenues by 47.15%.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Palantir\u2019s loss from operations increased by 103.61%, their stock-based compensation increased by 425.15%, their General and Admin expenses increased by 108.59%, and their net loss increased by 101.22%. Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock-based compensation, which will be addressed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Convertible Preferred Stock:** In 2020, Palantir issued a total of 797,771,675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous \u201cconvertible referred shares\u201d. This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s stock of 137.19%. This is a huge form of dilution, and I have never seen anything like this before, however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that.\n\n\u00b7 **Repurchase of Common Stock:** In 2020, Palantir repurchased 808,201 shares back. This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock, however any buyback is good to see as an investor. This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0.14%, which is not much, but we will still take it.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Warrants:** In 2020, Palantir experienced an additional 7,631,329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants. The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir\u2019s stock of 1.31%.\n\n\u00b7 **Common Stock (Net of Issuance Costs):** In 2020, Palantir unloaded 206,500,523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs. I believe that this means that, Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public. I could very well be wrong on that, and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great! Anyways, this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s common stock of roughly 35.51%. This is a large portion of dilution, however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir added 120,617,527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options. These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20.72%. Once again, this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors.\n\n\u00b7 **RSU\u2019s:** In 2020, Palantir issued 82,429,575 shares through their vesting of \u201cRestricted Stock Units\u201d (RSU\u2019s). This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14.18% (which is a lot of dilution).\n\n\u00b7 **Modification to Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir technically bought back 3,500,0000 shares through modifications to stock options (for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options). Confusing, right? This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0.6%.\n\n\u00b7 **Total Share Dilution in 2020:** In 2020, Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208.19%. This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed, however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020.\n\n*Explanation of Share Dilution:*\n\nOnce again, all of the below information can be found in Palantir\u2019s [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1).\n\nOn September 30th, 2020, Palantir completed their Direct Listing of their Class A common shares on the public markets on the NYSE. Part of this listing involved the redemption of all of Palantir\u2019s convertible share into common shares. This was the largest single source of dilution in Palantir (137%). Additionally, this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants, which resulted in dilution of 1.31%. Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued, net of issuance price to complete the direct listing, which had a dilutionary effect of 35.51%. Lastly, Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU\u2019s, which cause a dilutionary effect of 14.18%.\n\nWithout these factors of dilution, Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20%. This means that due to the Direct listing, Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188.19% to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing.\n\n*Overall Thoughts on Dilution:*\n\nPalantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution, and I have not seen anything quite like this before. Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors. However, we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing. However, how does Palantir dilution (excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years?\n\nFor starters, Palantir exhibited a 20% share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing. However, historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5.18% between 2017-2019. So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing, Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution. However, 20% of dilution is significantly different than the 208.19% of dilution (which would be crazily high). This 20% is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock, such as Palantir, so currently I would not be too worried. However, investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021, because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir\u2019s dilution after going public, than their past share dilution as a private company.\n\n*Competition:*\n\nIn order to undergo my comparable analyses (which will be discussed later on) I needed to select 4 companies, that I can compare to Palantir.\n\n[**$ZS \u2013 Zscaler Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/ZS)**:** ZScaler is a security as a service company that helps company adapt to cloud technologies and provides their cybersecurity services through the cloud. ZScaler provides their services to both commercial enterprises and governments, similar to that of Palantir. Furthermore, ZScaler offers their service primarily in the USA, but also has smaller international operations (again like Palantir).\n\n[**$SNOW \u2013 Snowflake Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SNOW)**:** Snowflake (like Palantir) is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data. Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering, data science, data applications, data sharing, and data warehouse. This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir, however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves. Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations, similar to that of Palantir.\n\n[**$SPLK \u2013 Splunk Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SPLK)**:** Splunk provide software platforms that deliver insights derived from their clients\u2019 data in the USA and internationally. Splunk offers their Ecosystem solutions that consist of data inputs, workflows, reports, dashboards, data visualizations, actions, and methods, and help their clients/customers to make the best out of their data. All of this sounds eerily familiar to the description of Palantir, making it one of the closer competitors. Splunk also offers their services to the public sector as well as the government, making their business model resemble that of Palantir so much more.\n\n[**$TYL \u2013 Tyler technologies Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/TYL)**:** Tyler technologies is probably the company in this list that least resembles that of Palantir, this is because they provide management solutions, accounting systems, billing systems and other solutions geared toward the public sector. Tyler technologies works primarily with governments of all types (Federal, State, and Municipal), and education institutions. However, the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions. Their data insights software enables collaboration, displays data visualizations/measurements, and generates insights for their human operators to act on.\n\n*Q1 2021 Updates:*\n\nAll of the below information can be found in [Palantir\u2019s Q1 Investor Presentation](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q1%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf).\n\nRecently, on May 11th, 2021, Palantir released their Q1 earnings report. When looking at Palantir\u2019s financial performance I did not take this into account, which means that this section will be packed with new information that will help us to understand Palantir\u2019s trajectory even more.\n\nFirst and foremost, this quarter was the first quarter in which Palantir has reported positive earnings. This is a big milestone for Palantir as a public company, and it helps to gets investors excited about the potentially profitable future of Palantir. In Q1, Palantir reported a free cash flow of $151M (was -$290M in Q1 2020) with a 44% adjusted FCF margin, they grew revenues by 49% YoY ($341M), and they grew billings by 248% YoY ($362M) which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts. These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir, which should excite their investors.\n\nFurthermore, during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC. This SPAC is [$QELL \u2013 Qell Acquisition Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/QELL) which merging with Lilium. Lilium is an eVTOL transportation company, with this investment they also came to a deal with Lilium to use Foundry for design, engineering, testing, production, quality, logistics, and operations. A while back I looked at another eVTOL SPAC Archer ([$ACIC \u2013 Atlas Crest Investment Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/ACIC)), which has great upside and has a similar business model to Lilium, so if you want to read that to be more informed about Liliums potential performance, [click here.](https://utradea.com/positions/Take_a_SHOT_at_Archers_SPAC_ACIC)\n\nIn Q1, Palantir was also awarded with a [5-year $90M contract](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210405005238/en/Palantir-Selected-by-the-National-Nuclear-Security-Administration-for-5-year-89.9M-Contract-for-SAFER-Project) from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER (Safety Analytics, Forecasting, and Evaluation Reporting) project. This is big news as this is one of Palantir\u2019s bigger contracts, and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir\u2019s software and their cross-enterprise data integration capabilities. On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations, the DoD used Palantir\u2019s software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence. This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right, and if the DoD likes it so much, then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises.\n\nLastly, in Q1, Palantir won 15 contracts worth over $5M, and 6 contracts worth over $10M with an average duration of 3.7 years (4.6 for commercial customers). This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this, and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal/negotiations. Additionally, Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83% (from 75% Q1 2020), and their contribution margin to 60% (from 41% in Q1 2020). This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase, the scale phase, which enables Palantir to grow their margins.\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Investment Valuation:***\n\n*Comparable Analyses:*\n\nI decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations (or opinions if you will). Preferably, I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate, however, if they are not consistent, I will take the average result. I was only able to find 2 multiples/ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios/multiples.\n\n*EV/Revenue:*\n\nThis is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet, like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies. By comparing Palantir\u2019s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (listed above on the \u201ccompetitors\u201d section of this report), I found that Palantir has a fair value of $32.85/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 23.31%. This implies that given Palantir\u2019s current price, they are undervalued, and the upside is very reasonable, however, I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains.\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Palantir\u2019s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $24.87/share, which implies that there is a downside risk of 6.64% to such an investment. As you have probably noticed, these results are not consistent, therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one, final price target.\n\n*Average Comparable:*\n\nBy taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $28.86/share, which implies an overall upside of 8.36% to this investment. This also implies that Palantir, is in fact an undervalued growth stock, that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market.\n\n***My Plan for Investing into Palantir:***\n\nMy plan for this investment is a little different from usual.\n\nI see anything between $24.87/share (Fair Value of P/B ratio) and $28.86/share (average comparable) as a good chance to buy Palantir at (or below) its fair value. This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment.\n\nHowever, I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long-run 3+ years. I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3+ years. During this time, I would re-evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding.\n\n***Potential Risks to Palantir\u2019s Stock - $PLTR:***\n\n\u00b7 **Dilution:** Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution, however, we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing. However, the 20% of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high. As investors, we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns/increases that we should be weary of. If these levels of dilution persist, potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions, which will hurt the share price.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** This year\u2019s financial performance was not one to be overly happy about. Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet, Palantir was still yet to make a profit, and increased their net losses by over 100%. If this poor financial performance continues, and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole, investors will run away from this stock and never look back. However, the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future, which will be discussed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Bad Press:** Historically, Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non-investors alike. Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through [Palantir\u2019s partnership with ICE](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54348456). Palantir quicky spoke out against this backlash by saying ICE took advantage of their software without proper oversight, and that they are looking into the issues, furthermore they have since declined some potential partnerships with other border agencies to avoid further backlash. There have also been numerous smaller controversies and protests that have damaged Palantir\u2019s reputation, and if there are more large controversies Palantir\u2019s stock could get hurt as a result of it.\n\n***Potential Catalysts that can Help Palantir\u2019s Stock Price:***\n\n\u00b7 **Share Buybacks:** Over the past year, Palantir has bought back (both directly and indirectly, in a sense) over 4,300,000 of their common shares. This is good to see as an investor, especially this early in the company (and not too long after their Direct Listing). This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future. This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares, and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** Palantir\u2019s 2020 financial report was not favourable (as discussed previously), however there were definitely some good to take out of it. Palantir increased their revenue, gross profit, and margins by a hefty amount, which is good to see as an investor, however, there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable. However, their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report.\n\n\u00b7 **Positive Press:** As previously mentioned, Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price. However, recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID-19, and their vaccine distribution efforts. Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir\u2019s technology. Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company. This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released.\n\n\u00b7 **Success Stories:** Since Palantir have gone public, they have had a few success stories come out, I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article. These success stories show how impactful Palantir\u2019s software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues, production etc. just by using Palantir\u2019s software. Any future stories like this that come out, highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar, and potential clients to reach out and start business/inquiries with Palantir.\n\n\u00b7 **Renewing Contracts:** I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir\u2019s share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case? This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir\u2019s 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years. After their time with Palantir\u2019s software expires they decide to renew the contract. This is good because it shows that Palantir\u2019s software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these $5-15M+ contract renewals. Furthermore, these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir\u2019s installation, and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins, which will reflect well on Palantir\u2019s future financial reports.\n\n\u00b7 **New Partnerships/Contracts (and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment):** Every time that Palantir, or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract/agreement, this will help Palantir\u2019s stock. This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections. Furthermore, as more commercial enterprises try Palantir\u2019s software (and hopefully enjoy it), the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot. I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry. Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment, and as more contracts role in, more enterprises will take an interest. Furthermore, when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract, it will help to increase their revenues, which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the, to beat estimates.\n\n*This analysis took a long time, and is one of the most comprehensive that I have seen, so I would greatly appreciate if you followed me* [*here*](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/BeatingTheVTI?utm_source=R&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=PLTR)*, and commented on my original post!*",

        "selftext": "So what does that mean, the market has turned upside down? What does that mean when the Nasdaq is hitting new highs everyday but many of the stocks I watch are down? What is this divergence? Is the Nasdaq index accurate? What stocks are actually up?\n\nSo yesterday 7/6/2021, I was surfing on Reddit and I did come across some Warren Buffet videos. The oracle of Omaha and well deserved. I have read a couple of his books maybe 10-12 years ago, read much about him but actually didn't see these videos until yesterday. In a nut shell he stated that you can not time the markets, no one can time the market, the best time to buy, is when you first see value and if anything but it in increments. The 2nd thing he stated was that he does not buy anything where he does not see value..... if it does not make money now..... because you can not predict the future, \"a bird in the hand right now, is worth 2 more in the bush.\" That means if you have a solid company making money now, do not jump ship and buy/speculate on something that is losing money/growing or for the short term perceives to be doing alot better. This paragraph will become important as I answer these questions. I hope to help calm everyones' nerves with the answers to these questions.\n\nI have wrote in many posts, as far back as a few weeks that the market is upside down, ever since the Nasdaq was at 13,800-14,000 and fed Powell was about to speak. The market upside down is when stocks that make money, have cash, give dividends, have the ability to buyback shares, raise dividends are falling like knives. Something like AFIN dipped under 8! NYCB under 11! (Again today, thanx for the trade), NYMT under 4.50 (Here we go again).. These are stocks that I constantly trade, and tell the elite team to trade when we are forced to pivot and seek safety. Why? Because they can do all of those things....... A company that does not make money, can not buy shares, can not raise dividends, and even as the stock drops they want to print more shares..\n\nMany followers and the elite team are asking me what do I think is going on, why is the Nasdaq making new highs but I see a sea of red? So, I did alot of digging this week. The Nasdaq is indeed a cap weighted Index.. So is the SP and Nasdaq 100 are all cap weighted. That means as the market cap of a company grows (That is the overall value of a company) the meaning and weight it carries on the index grows as well....Why does this matter? The big 5, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, FB... account for 40% of the nasdaq!!!! Look it up! I just did, because I am supposed to be all knowing! You guys do keep me sharp! AAPL alone accounts for 12% of the nasdaq index and nearly 20% of QQQ (Nasdaq 100). The Nasdaq has almost 5,000 tickers. So the fact that 5 company's can shift 40% or more! of the market means that 4,000 can call and 150 can be up and the NASDAQ can be up! Is that possible? Yesterday there were 4 decliners for every advancer.. (4,000 down, 1,000 up) that is 7/6/2021. Today 7/7/2021 there were about 1.5 decliners for every advancer. (3,000 down and 2,000 up)..... In fact the US equity market is about 50 trillion and covers about 12-13,000 tickers amongst the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX and OTC... These 5 make up about 10 trillion!! So, just these 5 are 20% of the entire US market!! Yes! Now, I knew they were important and cap weighted I just didnt know how so..... because these stocks are making record all time highs, the Nasdaq is at 14,600-14,700 and its a sea of red. I started to see what was up and saw these mighty titans and some speculative stocks.. So that is your answer....... it is happening, why the Nasdaq is making new highs and I see a sea of red. So the Nasdaq is accurate, their is no mistake. Some stocks like SE, BILL are going sky high, LMND bouncing back but these are strictly speculative, snow.......\n\nWhat is the danger in this? Why does it matter? Because I was even telling my elite team to me, we are already near a correction. If you take out 25 of the largest cap company's their is no doubt the Nasdaq is already down 5-10% but we cant see it! They have asked me other ways to track what is going on...... The only other way is to track other nasdaq important stocks to know, because if you track these 5 that mean the most, they are making highs. The danger in this is if they fall, it may cause a panic and speculative stocks will really crash! Because if the Nasdaq is at record highs and most people do not know its a few company's bringing up the market if the Nasdaq as a whole falls to 14,000 it may cause panic!\n\nWhat do we do? I am going back defensive after I sell of some of my offensive stocks....Or I will buy an offensive stock after its down at least 5% on the day.....\n\nRecall earlier the paragraph about Warren Buffet and buy value, cash cows, and buy more when fear is instilled elsewhere........ When the market started to turn upside down, an amazing value stock I had was TX, it dipped to 31, I did buy more, albeit in fear and traded it. It has bounced back to near 52 week highs as of today near 42. So that is a 30+ percent move in 2 weeks on a safe stock that makes cash! AFIN, BRMK, NYCB, they all recovered and made for great trades.... Today I am given another trading opportunity in NYCB and NYMT.......Now an offensive play, give it, these are Chinese are getting crushed and they are offensive. TIGR and VIPS. TIGR rose to 30!! It is now under 21...... VIPS dipped to 15 and change went back to 20.66 and has dropped this week because of DIDI (Chinese).. Same with TIGR.. I do own VIPS at 21.... I have been trading TIGR.... I just wanted you all to see what the difference is of a defensive play making tons of cash \\[1 in the hand, 2 in the bush\\]..... Now I do believe VIPS and TIGR are 2 offensive plays that should rise but we do have to be careful....\n\nSo in short, the market is upside down, being held by a few stocks.

        "selftext": "Prepare to ask yourself: \"Is that scrap steel in my pocket, or am I just happy to meet SCHN?\" as I kick off an epic three part series on Schnitzer Steel with a balls-of-steel short term bet. These junkyard bums used to barely scrape a living by buying your junk car, removing the upholstery stained with your trisomy sperm, stripping the car down more than your mom did on stage while pregnant with you, then finally harvesting the steel for cash.\n\nNowadays, Schnitzer is rolling in tendies, and not just the ones they find underneath the car seats. Due to several industry tailwinds set to continue for years, scrap prices are at decade long highs. As Cleveland Cliffs CEO and steel oracle Lourenco Goncalves stated just last week: **\"Prime scrap is the new precious metal.\"** Schnitzer are industry experts at collecting, sorting, processing, and selling and exporting the stuff.\n\nI'm balls deep long on SCHN because I agree that the demand for scrap will reach record highs in the coming years, and because SCHN is perfectly situated to take advantage. However, **currently there's a short term play that worked out for me last time, and this time around the set-up is even better.** It'll make for a good introduction to this ticker.\n\nIn this part 1 of 3, I go over that idiotic bet for you to get all apish over and blame me if it doesn't work out. Parts 2 and 3 will be much more in depth and long-term focused.\n\n**tldr:**\n\n* The previous three quarters, SCHN went down after beating earnings, only to quickly recover and hit new 52w highs. SCHN just posted an earnings beat last week and, surprise surprise, it went down. I think it will pop back up, because:\n* SCHN trends with the price of HRC (steel futures), since this drives demand for scrap. HRC has been going up up up.\n* The SCHN/HRC spread is at a low right now; recently it has always bounced back up within about a month, and always before next earnings.\n* SCHN's IV is low since they just reported earnings, making the upside to this quite significant.\n* Other steel companies post Q2 earnings this month... look at HRC prices and tell me they won't blow the lid off earnings, taking SCHN up with them.\n* In my estimation, there are several significant upside risks, and few downside risks.\n* PTs: $55 by end of July, $60 by end of August.\n* Bonus: **I did this play last earnings and flipped $3k into $10k.** With 4-month out options.\n\nPositions:\n\n* Jul Calls ($50, $55): 15%\n* Aug Calls ($50, $55): 15%\n* Commons: 70%\n\n\\---\n\n# I. SCHN's earnings cycles summarized\n\n===============\n\nNote: **I created an Appendix for actual wrinkle-generation at the bottom. Go take a look now if you care.** You don't really *need* to know that stuff to smash the \"buy-FDs-at-market-price\" button with your closed fist while grunting \"fuck hedgies\" or whatever, but knowing this stuff will certainly help you explain to your step-dad why his credit limit was reached.\n\n===============\n\nThis short-term play is mostly based on the last three post-earning periods that all show the same pattern: **SCHN gets dumped after beating earnings, then roars back to 52w highs and closes the spread with steel prices.** I believe this post-earnings price action is driven by two factors: A rise in steel prices, and positive earnings from steel companies. **The set-up this time around looks even better, and further catalysts are listed in another section.**\n\nWhy am I only looking at the three last earning periods? This is when the steel boom really began (HRC going from $475 to $1800). Prior to that, steel prices were dirt cheap and steel related stocks were in a glut. If you don't know about the whole steel resurgence thing, read some CLF/TX DDs or wait for Part II. Long story short: demand is increasing (infrastructure, autos, etc), supply is decreasing (limited capacity, China not exporting as much).\n\nAnyway, **this dump after earnings is not a surprise for those of us that follow the stock.** We SCHN traders call this the \"back up the truck\" period: After earnings, we load up on more shares. Now you can be like us! (Except you probably won't buy shares.)\n\nI did this same strategy last earnings and flipped $3k to $10k. This time around has some advantages: SCHN/HRC spread is better, 52w is already established at \\~$60, HRC has gone up the roughly same, and Q2 steel earnings will be randy-at-computer.jpg. There are also some possible catalysts (but I wouldn't bet on those alone).\n\n\\---\n\n# II. The Chart\n\nHere's a pretty picture for you:\n\n[Crayons make me want to buy.](https://preview.redd.it/ap7xzhs0en971.png?width=1819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2033e9b07541842b8b6fae7285948da3b2cf3dc)\n\nI'll describe the chart in more detail, as surely the bright colors are causing some sort of primitive fight-or-flight response. It's ok, guys, daddy is right here.\n\n## The Pattern\n\n1. Steel prices (the gray line) rise a ton during the quarter.\n2. The market expects SHCN to have a huge earnings beat.\n3. SCHN gets pumped up in the week prior to earnings.\n4. SCHN reports, and it's only a really big earnings beat, but not an OJ-Simpson-beating-murder charges type of beat.\n5. Market over-sells SCHN.\n6. HRC inevitably rises more, after the sideways leading-into-the-month period.\n7. Within a month, steel stocks report record earnings.\n8. Market realizes: Oh, shit HRC prices are still climbing and SCHN actually *did* crush earnings pretty bigly, and everything steel is raking in cash!\n9. SCHN races upwards and obliterates the SCHN/HRC spread.\n10. Multibagger, depending on how retarded you play it.\n\n## The SCHN/HRC Spread\n\nThis is the graph at the bottom. It's the price of HRC (steel) divided by the SCHN share price.\n\nIf you want a better understanding of this, head to the appendix. Otherwise, just read this sentence: **When HRC goes up, SCHN makes more money**. So, the two should track relatively well, and for the most part, they do (+/- 15%).\n\nThe pattern I notice is that when this spread gets low, it doesn't stay low for long. It inevitably goes back up as the market takes into account that SCHN will be selling their scrap for beaucoup dollars. In fact, it seems to run up at least once before the next earnings period, often times within just a month. **I'm betting on run up occurring again soon.**\n\nThe yellow circles are good buy points (if red) and good sell points (if green). Follow the yellow lines up...\n\n## The Wieners\n\nThe yellow lines are the \"bump\" periods we want to capture. I highlighted the price action between the \"buy\" and \"sell\" periods to create some of my patented beautiful [green dildos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzszyd/bgs_green_giant_dildos_and_cream_of_wsb/).\n\n**I actually played this strategy after the earnings in April:**\n\n[$3k to $10k after last earnings.](https://preview.redd.it/55d2sfu1en971.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e995942051ba727486c1ffe8737b85091412888)\n\nBeing the conservative little bitch that I was back then, I bought a full four months out to *August*, paper handed some calls, and still managed to 2.5x my initial investment. I don't have historical data, but if I followed the yellow dots and bought March or April calls instead, I'm sure that's at least a 10-bagger.\n\n\\---\n\n# III. HRC Prices / Other Steel Stocks\n\nCritical to this short-term thesis:\n\n1. HRC prices continue to rise (or, at least not fall), and within a month or two.\n2. Steel companies blow out earnings.\n\n## HRC Prices\n\nLet's take a closer look at HRC prices:\n\nPrices of HRC contracts over time. They go up.\n\n[$3k to $10k after last earnings.](https://preview.redd.it/q9tb01o2en971.png?width=1095&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c291cc469d7a6e8eac3d64f3c3d4a44b852a3df)\n\nThis charts the price of each HRC contract through time. You won't find this chart anywhere else because I had to scrape websites and do a ton of tedious bullshit to make this chart.\n\nThe whole reason I track this is because bought a ton of HRC contracts (\\~300 tons worth of future-steel) right before that big dip in May, got margin called four days in a row, didn't fold like a paper handed bitch, and just finally made it out alive with a bit of profit. The reason the chart is rainbow colored, however, is because I'm super gay, and not because it's the default colors of google charts.\n\nAnyway, here's what I learned trading futures and what you should notice: **HRC prices move sideways into the new month, then start to climb a week or so later.** Go ahead, look at each new month. I even marked it with scribbles.\n\nI believe this is due to low volumes during the front of the month as hedges against steel orders for future months are just starting to get worked out. It just occurred to me I could plot the total volume of all contracts... (30 minutes later)...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Volumes and prices often pick up after the beginning of each month.](https://preview.redd.it/8wmklz44en971.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6882045d216f7560755f77f1f26cb42d52cfc7b7)\n\nIt looks like there are two patterns:\n\n1. Volume (of all contracts) does tend to settle during the month change.\n2. The more volume there is, the more the price changes (roughly).\n\nIt's not iron clad, but it looks more often than not HRC prices like to run-up mid month as volume picks up. I just checked my calendar. It's almost mid month.\n\nNow, here's the kicker: **SCHN reports near the new month, when HRC prices trade sideways.** That's to our advantage, because what happens when HRC prices start to climb again? That's right retards, SCHN goes up with it.\n\n## Steel Earnings\n\nBesides HRC prices themselves, the other part of this short-term thesis is that steel stocks will post incredible earnings (yet again), causing share prices to rise and pulling SCHN up with them.  Steelmaking stocks have been covered to death in other DDs, so I won't go into too much detail.\n\nHowever, I will say that steelmakers are absolutely rolling in cash right now. Their profit margins are so high that each dollar increase in HRC prices are effectively a dollar of profit (times the millions of tons of steel they produce).\n\n**This quarter will be even better, due to the lag between steel prices and the revenues steelmakers actually get, as well as HRC outpacing everybody's expectations.** Steelmakers, such as CLF, have different types of contracts -- some yearly, some quarterly, some monthly, some at spot. A significant amount of their contracts, with auto manufacturers for example, are yearly and quarterly. As the old contracts expire and the new ones are negotiated, steelmakers rake in the profits from high steel prices.\n\nI expect steelmakers' earnings to be quite solid, as they have been all year. There's zero reason to believe otherwise.\n\n## The takeaway\n\nDrill this into your brain:\n\n* HRC trades sideways into the new month, then starts to rip. This is good, because you can buy SCHN cheap before HRC takes off again.\n* HRC has been ripping non-stop all year. These insane prices will show up even more in steelmakers' Q2 earnings due to contracts being renegotiated.\n* What's good for steelmakers is good for SCHN.\n\n\\---\n\n# IV. Downside Risks\n\nNow before you get all giddy over this, it's time to go over the bad news: Your mom hates you, and you could lose money on this bet.\n\n## Past results may not be indicative of future results\n\nThis is obvious, which means it definitely needs to be stated. The past three earnings have shown SCHN to bounce back (relative to HRC) before the next earnings period.. but this doesn't make it a guarantee. Ok?\n\nAlso, HRC could *fall* to close the SCHN/HRC gap. As unlikely as I see this, anything is possible. The reason I don't think HRC will fall is because demand is so solid, and supply is not increasing. If anything, worldwide supply is decreasing as China is increasingly showing signs of cutting production and disincentivizing the exporting of their steel. Remember, they export 15-20% of the world's steel, so what they do is *very* significant.\n\nOh, right, downside risks. Ok, here we go:\n\n## China\n\nHRC took a big tumble in May because [China fucked with their commodities market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/china-exchanges-move-to-cool-iron-ore-steel-price-rally-2021-05-10) in an attempt to suppress runaway commodity prices. They basically jacked up margin requirements overnight, so that in the morning traders got slammed with margin calls and either had to liquidate or deposit more capital to hold their now-shitty positions in contracts that were getting liquidated by everyone else.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n&gt;BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - China's commodity exchanges on Monday moved to raise trading limits and margin requirements for some iron ore contracts and reinstated fees on steel futures as a blistering rally in the ferrous metals complex showed no signs of abating.\n\nThis dip in commodities spread overseas, and I got fucking slammed by it, so I am fully aware of how effective China can be when it comes to manipulation.\n\n**China still has an incentive to manipulate HRC prices downward.** They want to keep their steel within their borders, and keep that steel cheap, to feed their 6% yearly growth target. As such they can do crazy shit like fuck with their futures market (which will have contagion around the world), make crazy announcements, and who knows what the fuck else.\n\nHowever, I find an export tax to \"seal the borders of steel\" to be much more likely and beneficial approach. See upside risks.\n\n## The Fire in May\n\nOn May 22, 2021, SCHN experienced a fire at its Cascade Steel Rolling Mill in McMinnville, Oregon. They stated in earnings that they very confident insurance will fully cover the repair costs as well as missed revenues. However, that's not settled yet, and they are waiting for confirmation.\n\nIt's possible they are found at fault and/or that the insurance payment is much less than expected. This could ding the stock a bit.\n\nOn the flipside, the confirmation of coverage could come sooner and be higher than expected. (It's in the upsides as well.)\n\n## The usual, contagions, etc\n\nSCHN is not immune to any of the following:\n\n* Unforeseen bad news for SCHN. I don't know, maybe their [hottie CEO](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) dies or something.\n* Unforeseen bad news for US Steelmakers (SCHN correlates highly).\n* Unforeseen bad news for market. Burry, JPow, just stfu for a few weeks. Biden, stfu about taxes.\n* A continued dumping of value stocks for shiny growth stocks.\n\n\\---\n\n# V. Upside Risks\n\n**The largest catalysts have already been mentioned in depth:**\n\n1. SCHN/HRC gap closing short term and/or by next earnings. This has been a consistent pattern.\n2. HRC bumping up mid-month, after the into-the-month sideways pattern.\n3. Q2 steelmakers' pulling up SCHN with them.\n\nI'll move on to other catalysts now. To be clear, I would not be making the bet based on any of these catalysts occurring, they're just possible \"bonuses\".\n\n## China\n\nChina produces, consumes, and exports the most steel of any country. To a large degree, they dictate the global price of steel. Any decrease in the amount of steel they export will lead to higher HRC prices globally. **Higher HRC prices means higher scrap prices, means more profits for SCHN.**\n\nFurthermore, any drop in production increases the likelihood they will export less. Why? China needs the steel for themselves to fuel their 6% GDP growth.\n\nSo, count 'em, two possible catalysts from China that may increase steel prices:\n\n1. An export tax. [This has been rumored for awhile](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3990727/FOCUS-What-Chinas-possible-new-steel-export-taxes-mean-for-global-ferrous-industry.html), but could become a reality at any time.\n2. A drop in production. [A decrease in 30% production in the main steel town in China](https://finance.sina.cn/2021-07-06/detail-ikqciyzk3735769.d.html?sinawapsharesource=newsapp&amp;wm=3200_0024) was actually reported yesterday, July 5.\n\n## Positive News on Chip Shortage / Autos\n\nI don't follow semis or chip shortage news much, so perhaps this is already priced in. However, anything good for autos is good for steelmakers, which is good for SCHN.\n\nIf the market digests news that auto manufacturers are running at full speed again, they may begin to value US steelmaker stocks more highly. This would likely pull up SCHN.\n\n## Other Macro Stuff\n\nNot long ago we had a shift from growth-to-value. That seems to have reversed, but it's always possible it starts back up again. This play is so short term that I wouldn't bet on it, unless you are going out until to November or buying shares.\n\n## Little Schnitzer Things\n\n## Possible Dividend Increase?\n\nI'm not sure where or when dividends are declared, so feel free to call me a complete dumbass about this. I searched their last earnings report and could not find the declaration of their next dividend (the one after this upcoming July 9th one).\n\nSo, there's a possibility they announce their next dividend soon, and it's higher than expected. I do not expect there to be much impact from this, but just throwing it out there as a possibility.\n\n## Insurance Settlement\n\nAs noted in the downside risks, in May Schnitzer experienced a fire in their steel mill in Oregon. In their earnings report they mentioned they are still waiting for the exact settlement number:\n\n&gt;We have insurance that we believe is fully applicable to the losses and are currently working with our insurers on claims for property loss and damage and business interruption losses. We anticipate that insured recoveries made of policy deductibles and various conditions, exclusions and limits will cover most of the cost to repair and replace lost and damaged assets and also a significant amount of lost income as a result of the fire. The accounting recognition of such recoveries is expected to occur over several quarters.\n\nIt's possible this number is announced soon. Though it's not likely to be impactful, I thought it was worth a mention.\n\n\\---\n\n# VI. Appendix (Optional): Steel, Scrap, and SCHN.\n\n**You can skip this if you are manically scrolling to the bottom to see positions and shit.**\n\n## Scrap\n\nSteel is one of the most recyclable materials in the world. It is also environmentally taxing (and increasingly expensive) to create from scratch. As such, steelmakers prefer to buy scrap and melt it down to make new steel.\n\nScrap metal in the US is plentiful, as we enjoyed much of the 20th century being the steel center of the world. We have a lot of if laying around. Think: those junkyards with car skeletons and washing machines stacked high. (You should have a drive-by and see for yourself if those piles are getting higher or lower.)\n\nBeing responsible soy cucks that care about the environment, the US has also spent the last 100 years building out businesses to collect, sort, process, and reuse scrap metal. One such leading business that is publicly traded is SCHN.\n\n## EAFs\n\nAn elecrical arc furnace (EAF) is a new-ish type of steel furnace that uses electricity to smelt steel. [They are loud as fuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j2jESz7Zl8#t=1m32s) and if I could choose my own death, it would death by EAF.\n\nAnyway, EAFs are great because they *drastically* reduce CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5 emissions (small 2.5um particles that make humans sick when they breath them). They can take scrap metal as input, allowing for cheap and easy recycling of steel. **EAFs are the future of steelmaking, and is why \"scrap will become the next precious metal.\"**\n\n## Steel Prices\n\nThe price of steel (eg, HRC prices) is a rough proxy for how valuable scrap is. Steelmakers can buy scrap, smelt it, and then sell the new steel. If they can sell steel for more, they can afford to buy scrap for more.\n\nSCHN collects scrap and sells it. As steel prices climb, SCHN can sell the scrap they collect for more. While it may become more costly for them to collect the scrap, their margins have actually increased. Their margins have steadily increased: 13% (Q4 - quarter ending Aug '20), 14.63% (Q1), 18.84% (Q2), 17.35% (Q3 - ending May '21, reported last week).\n\n## China\n\nChina makes 55% of the world's steel (and exports 15-20% of the world's steel), and until now they have not been responsible soy cucks. As noted in [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q) (March '21):\n\n&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tons it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China\u2019s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories. \u201cSteel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,\u201d said Huang (the \"Minister of Ecology and Environment\" in charge of cracking down on steelmakers)\n\nTheir air quality sucks, it's killing people, and they have the Olympics coming up:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Apparently some regions are like smoking 40 cigarettes a day.](https://preview.redd.it/ev6pr9f5en971.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5add313e6aa51a7a8e606788daacb2a98d1b6d3f)\n\nTo cut pollution from steel, China is doing the following:\n\n1. Cutting down on production\n2. Cutting down on exporting (they recently removed an incentive to export steel, and a tax is rumored to be in the works)\n3. Switching to EAFs. (BTW: China doesn't have 100 years of junk cars laying around.)\n\n**All three of these drive a higher price of steel and a higher demand for scrap.**\n\n## tldr long-term basics:\n\n* Steelmakers love scrap\n* High steel prices (HRC) means SCHN makes more money\n* China makes, consumes, and exports the most steel (by far) of anyone in the world\n* China essentially dictates the price of steel around the world\n* China is exporting less = HRC prices go up\n* China is switching to EAFs = China will want scrap\n\n\\---\n\n# VII. The Bets\n\nThe risk/reward metrics for various calls are for you to determine, but I'll share my notes.\n\nThe \"moderately retarded\" bet would be Aug $50's. They're \\~$2.50 and I think they'll be above $10.00 at some point. That's about the same risk/reward as Aug $55's ($1.25, could end at $5.00), but the $50s, being closer to ITM, are much safer.\n\nSome more notes/advice for you to ignore:\n\n* My PT for this bet is $55 for July and $60 by August.\n* Both IV and share price on SCHN are looking juicy on the drop after earnings, and especially given today's price action in steel. (It's interesting to see SCHN recovering faster than the pack.)\n* SCHN IV, at time of writing (3:30pm Tuesday) is at 48% -- 14th %'ile over 26w period. Looks good to me.\n* The volume on SCHN is rather low... based on past experience posting about WWE and BGS, that could mean the stock and/or IV pops. If it does, then sit it out and wait for better entry. You have time.\n* Don't YOLO, determine what you are willing to pay right now before looking at the prices, and if the market is pricing it otherwise, then wait.\n\nAs noted in the DD, I expect steelmakers' earnings will be good and will lift SCHN, though it may take a week or two for them to actually move. Here's a list of upcoming earnings:\n\n* STLD: Jul 19-ish\n* NUE: Jul 21-ish\n* CLF: Jul 22\n* X: Jul 28-ish\n\n## Aug 20 Calls\n\nThe real taster's choice shit. This give exposure to steelmakers' earnings, plus some time for the market to digest them. They cover August 1st, which could be a possible China export tax announcement date. They also give plenty of time for SCHN/HRC to close. Based on the past three post-earnings periods, SCHN has gone up significantly within 45 days.\n\nThe prices are nice -- $55 calls are around $1.10 a pop, so that's a 4-bagger if my $60 PT is hit, and more if the IV and/or share price rally before expiration. Given that the $50's are similar ($2.50 each), they're a safer bet.\n\n## Nov Calls\n\nIn my opinion, these are pointlessly far out for this bet. The main catalysts will have already happened by Aug 20, so why pay for time you won't use? There might be a play here to go OTM and hope for a volatility spike into steelmakers' earnings -- but I think liquidity will be shit. I'm passing on these.",

        "selftext": "So what does that mean, the market has turned upside down? What does that mean when the Nasdaq is hitting new highs everyday but many of the stocks I watch are down? What is this divergence? Is the Nasdaq index accurate? What stocks are actually up?\n\nSo yesterday 7/6/2021, I was surfing on Reddit and I did come across some Warren Buffet videos. The oracle of Omaha and well deserved. I have read a couple of his books maybe 10-12 years ago, read much about him but actually didn't see these videos until yesterday. In a nut shell he stated that you can not time the markets, no one can time the market, the best time to buy, is when you first see value and if anything but it in increments. The 2nd thing he stated was that he does not buy anything where he does not see value..... if it does not make money now..... because you can not predict the future, \"a bird in the hand right now, is worth 2 more in the bush.\" That means if you have a solid company making money now, do not jump ship and buy/speculate on something that is losing money/growing or for the short term perceives to be doing alot better. This paragraph will become important as I answer these questions. I hope to help calm everyones' nerves with the answers to these questions.\n\nI have wrote in many posts, as far back as a few weeks that the market is upside down, ever since the Nasdaq was at 13,800-14,000 and fed Powell was about to speak. The market upside down is when stocks that make money, have cash, give dividends, have the ability to buyback shares, raise dividends are falling like knives. Something like AFIN dipped under 8! NYCB under 11! (Again today, thanx for the trade), NYMT under 4.50 (Here we go again).. These are stocks that I constantly trade, and tell the elite team to trade when we are forced to pivot and seek safety. Why? Because they can do all of those things....... A company that does not make money, can not buy shares, can not raise dividends, and even as the stock drops they want to print more shares..\n\nMany followers and the elite team are asking me what do I think is going on, why is the Nasdaq making new highs but I see a sea of red? So, I did alot of digging this week. The Nasdaq is indeed a cap weighted Index.. So is the SP and Nasdaq 100 are all cap weighted. That means as the market cap of a company grows (That is the overall value of a company) the meaning and weight it carries on the index grows as well....Why does this matter? The big 5, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, FB... account for 40% of the nasdaq!!!! Look it up! I just did, because I am supposed to be all knowing! You guys do keep me sharp! AAPL alone accounts for 12% of the nasdaq index and nearly 20% of QQQ (Nasdaq 100). The Nasdaq has almost 5,000 tickers. So the fact that 5 company's can shift 40% or more! of the market means that 4,000 can call and 150 can be up and the NASDAQ can be up! Is that possible? Yesterday there were 4 decliners for every advancer.. (4,000 down, 1,000 up) that is 7/6/2021. Today 7/7/2021 there were about 1.5 decliners for every advancer. (3,000 down and 2,000 up)..... In fact the US equity market is about 50 trillion and covers about 12-13,000 tickers amongst the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX and OTC... These 5 make up about 10 trillion!! So, just these 5 are 20% of the entire US market!! Yes! Now, I knew they were important and cap weighted I just didnt know how so..... because these stocks are making record all time highs, the Nasdaq is at 14,600-14,700 and its a sea of red. I started to see what was up and saw these mighty titans and some speculative stocks.. So that is your answer....... it is happening, why the Nasdaq is making new highs and I see a sea of red. So the Nasdaq is accurate, their is no mistake. Some stocks like SE, BILL are going sky high, LMND bouncing back but these are strictly speculative, snow.......\n\nWhat is the danger in this? Why does it matter? Because I was even telling my elite team to me, we are already near a correction. If you take out 25 of the largest cap company's their is no doubt the Nasdaq is already down 5-10% but we cant see it! They have asked me other ways to track what is going on...... The only other way is to track other nasdaq important stocks to know, because if you track these 5 that mean the most, they are making highs. The danger in this is if they fall, it may cause a panic and speculative stocks will really crash! Because if the Nasdaq is at record highs and most people do not know its a few company's bringing up the market if the Nasdaq as a whole falls to 14,000 it may cause panic!\n\nWhat do we do? I am going back defensive after I sell of some of my offensive stocks....Or I will buy an offensive stock after its down at least 5% on the day.....\n\nRecall earlier the paragraph about Warren Buffet and buy value, cash cows, and buy more when fear is instilled elsewhere........ When the market started to turn upside down, an amazing value stock I had was TX, it dipped to 31, I did buy more, albeit in fear and traded it. It has bounced back to near 52 week highs as of today near 42. So that is a 30+ percent move in 2 weeks on a safe stock that makes cash! AFIN, BRMK, NYCB, they all recovered and made for great trades.... Today I am given another trading opportunity in NYCB and NYMT.......Now an offensive play, give it, these are Chinese are getting crushed and they are offensive. TIGR and VIPS. TIGR rose to 30!! It is now under 21...... VIPS dipped to 15 and change went back to 20.66 and has dropped this week because of DIDI (Chinese).. Same with TIGR.. I do own VIPS at 21.... I have been trading TIGR.... I just wanted you all to see what the difference is of a defensive play making tons of cash \\[1 in the hand, 2 in the bush\\]..... Now I do believe VIPS and TIGR are 2 offensive plays that should rise but we do have to be careful....\n\nSo in short, the market is upside down, being held by a few stocks. I refer to the Nasdaq as most of us trade tech/growth. I hope this explains much, and calms nerves for people with stocks that make cash!!!",

        "selftext": "So what does that mean, the market has turned upside down? What does that mean when the Nasdaq is hitting new highs everyday but many of the stocks I watch are down? What is this divergence? Is the Nasdaq index accurate? What stocks are actually up?\n\nSo yesterday 7/6/2021, I was surfing on Reddit and I did come across some Warren Buffet videos. The oracle of Omaha and well deserved. I have read a couple of his books maybe 10-12 years ago, read much about him but actually didn't see these videos until yesterday. In a nut shell he stated that you can not time the markets, no one can time the market, the best time to buy, is when you first see value and if anything but it in increments. The 2nd thing he stated was that he does not buy anything where he does not see value..... if it does not make money now..... because you can not predict the future, \"a bird in the hand right now, is worth 2 more in the bush.\" That means if you have a solid company making money now, do not jump ship and buy/speculate on something that is losing money/growing or for the short term perceives to be doing alot better. This paragraph will become important as I answer these questions. I hope to help calm everyones' nerves with the answers to these questions.\n\nI have wrote in many posts, as far back as a few weeks that the market is upside down, ever since the Nasdaq was at 13,800-14,000 and fed Powell was about to speak. The market upside down is when stocks that make money, have cash, give dividends, have the ability to buyback shares, raise dividends are falling like knives. Something like AFIN dipped under 8! NYCB under 11! (Again today, thanx for the trade), NYMT under 4.50 (Here we go again).. These are stocks that I constantly trade, and tell the elite team to trade when we are forced to pivot and seek safety. Why? Because they can do all of those things....... A company that does not make money, can not buy shares, can not raise dividends, and even as the stock drops they want to print more shares..\n\nMany followers and the elite team are asking me what do I think is going on, why is the Nasdaq making new highs but I see a sea of red? So, I did alot of digging this week. The Nasdaq is indeed a cap weighted Index.. So is the SP and Nasdaq 100 are all cap weighted. That means as the market cap of a company grows (That is the overall value of a company) the meaning and weight it carries on the index grows as well....Why does this matter? The big 5, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, FB... account for 40% of the nasdaq!!!! Look it up! I just did, because I am supposed to be all knowing! You guys do keep me sharp! AAPL alone accounts for 12% of the nasdaq index and nearly 20% of QQQ (Nasdaq 100). The Nasdaq has almost 5,000 tickers. So the fact that 5 company's can shift 40% or more! of the market means that 4,000 can call and 150 can be up and the NASDAQ can be up! Is that possible?

        "selftext": "Oracle is currently at all time highs and is breaking out with 3% moves for the past few days. Here's a few reasons why I think this will keep going and if you do not want to miss another MSFT or AMZN, you should buy Oracle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Oracle is extremely undervalued with a P/E of 19.19 as a Cloud/Software company.  Usually Cloud/Software companies like Microsoft or Goog have P/es in the high 30s/40s. \n\n2.  Oracle does massive stockbuybacks with them announcing a 20 billion stock repurchase plan this year as well as having a dividend yield of 1.46% which is way higher than AAPL or MSFT.\n\n3. Oracle is growing massively with 8% YoY growth from last year yet they are being priced as a boomer company \n\n4. With the recent JEDI news being cancelled now Oracle has a shot of receiving this contract which should also boost stock price.  [https://www.barrons.com/articles/oracle-stock-defense-cloud-contract-51625863023](https://www.barrons.com/articles/oracle-stock-defense-cloud-contract-51625863023) love round numbers. When was the last time you saw a stock at 80 or 90 and eventually never hit 100? Almost never. Stocks love to hit round numbers.\n\n6. Options are extremely cheap on oracle with them sometimes being less than 10 cents even though the stock is at 80$ currently. This means there is alot of gamma squeeze potential with Oracle as it is extremely cheap to buy OTM options for Oracle and thus force MM's to buy shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Tl;dr: Oracle is an extremely undervalued Cloud/ Software company that is currently breaking out right now with an extremely high chance of hitting 100 very soon. I would recommend buying calls on Oracle as they are currently very cheap with them being a few cents each for OTM calls.",

Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth.

        "selftext": "**Valuation: Undervalued**\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Technologies Inc Investment Summary:***\n\n\u00b7 Recently, there has been a lot of buzz around Palantir, however, very few people actually understand what they do and how they operate. As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactlywhat Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now.\n\no I am no data engineer, so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does, some of my interpretations may be off, so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong.\n\n\u00b7 Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent, Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long-term hold.\n\no The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports, and any news that may come out.\n\n\u00b7 It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is, which is why my investment plan (found in the \u201cplan\u201d section) is different than usual.\n\no There are various risks to this investment (like there are to every investment), these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the \u201crisks\u201d section.\n\no Additionally, there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir\u2019s share price, both in the short and long term(s). These catalysts are listed at the end of this report.\n\n***Overview of Palantir as a Company:***\n\n[$PLTR - Palantir Technologies Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/PLTR) was founded in 2003 (after their fear/anger after the events observed through 9/11) and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible. At this point in time, Palantir\u2019s only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts.\n\nHowever, since that point in time, Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises, as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications. Now, Palantir\u2019s revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts.\n\n*Palantir has 2 main software platforms, Palantir \u201cGotham\u201d, and Palantir \u201cFoundry\u201d.*\n\n[**Palantir Gotham**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/) was their first software platform and was designed for defense/intelligence use cases. Palantir has stated that this kind of platform helps agencies find \u201cneedles in thousands of haystacks\u201d. They also noted that [Gotham helped soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact-Study-Palantir-Defense-During-Drawdown.pdf) to map networks of bomb makers and insurgents through deep/hidden patterns and datasets, helping the army save time and lives. Since this mission, Gotham has expanded into defense operations and mission planning. During this time, Palantir found that Gotham could also be applied in Airbus\u2019 business, as their planes require millions of parts, assembled in multiple factories in different countries. However, Palantir decided to make another software platform that is better tailored to commercial enterprises, this platform was labelled \u201cPalantir Foundry\u201d.\n\n[**Palantir Foundry**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) transforms the way in which organizations interact with their information by creating a central operating system for their data. Palantir enables their customers to construct their own models quickly and easily from countless sets of data points.\n\nPalantir software is used by their 139 Government and Commercial Institutions/enterprises, in over 40 industries, ranging over 150 countries. Palantir works with the US Government and their several allies abroad, as well as the worlds most important/reliable companies.\n\nLastly, Palantir has stated \u201cWe are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build the software that enable our customers to integrate their own data that they already have.\u201d\n\n***Everything you need to know about Palantir and $PLTR:***\n\n*Palantir Foundry:*\n\nFoundry is essentially a [data warehouse](https://panoply.io/data-warehouse-guide/the-difference-between-a-database-and-a-data-warehouse/) that helps their commercial customers to collect and analyze their data. Foundry\u2019s platform includes a [graphical data interface](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface) that is extremely user friendly allowing their customers to get the most out of their data. Furthermore, Foundry provides statistical analyses through the use of their [AI machine learning](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/ai-ml/) networks that are able to consistently deliver efficient and accurate results.\n\nFoundry helps to enables all of their users, regardless of their technical abilities, to work meaningfully and act with the data that they collect. Foundry provides a suite of applications that help combine data analytics and business logic, helping them to deliver superior data integration.\n\nFoundry\u2019s front-end (what the user sees) enables their users to take advantage of all of the data collected by their organization to make informed decisions. Foundry also has a fantastic application for inter-organizational collaboration, this helps a team to build on each others work.\n\n*Foundry brings all of an enterprises data together onto their platform, however there are access controls in place to define what individuals get control over which dataset(s). From there, Foundry is able to deliver advanced analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company\u2019s data, make quality insights, so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage.*\n\n**Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite.**\n\n*Palantir Gotham:*\n\nDubbed \u201cThe Operating System for Government Decision Making\u201d, Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations.\n\nGotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government, to help them find what they are looking for. Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life. This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real-world responses to threats that Gotham identifies. Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies.\n\nThere is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham, which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with. However, what we do know is that these organizations have re-signed contracts with Palantir, which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly \u201cthe real deal\u201d.\n\nLastly, Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers, primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries. Furthermore, [Palantir has been credited](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2015/01/12/leaked-documents-bernie-madoff-convicted-thanks-to.html) with assisting in finding the largest Ponzi scheme ever (Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi Scheme).\n\n*Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place. Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data, and key patterns, so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats/problems they face in real-time.*\n\n*Palantir\u2019s Approach:*\n\nPalantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis, and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data.\n\nPalantir recognises that other companies sell features, tools, applications, and/or dashboards, however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run (if at all). Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software/platform to have sustainable, reliable, and safe data solutions.\n\nPalantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large \u201cfarms\u201d of data provided by each of their client companies. By doing this, Palantir is able to feed more data/information into their machine learning, AI, and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient. This also enables [cross-industry data pools](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU), that can be used by their companies when they look to expand or for opportunities in other verticals.\n\n*Palantir Success Stories:*\n\n**BP:**\n\nPerhaps the most notable success story that has come from Palantir is their partnership with [$BP \u2013 British Petroleum](https://utradea.com/stocks/BP)\n\nBP and Palantir have been partners since 2014, and recently (February 2021) [BP and Palantir have extended their partnership](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/05/palantir-deepens-ties-with-bp-with-new-5-year-deal/) for 5 more years. Palantir has helped BP to transform their business into a more digital one, and this extension of their partnership will ensure a further acceleration of their strategic digitization of their business.\n\nPalantir\u2019s Foundry has already helped BP by streamlining and enhancing their hydrocarbon-based workflows. Palantir helped BP to analyze their drilling data and has helped them to [increase their oil production in the North Sea by over 10%.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/palantir-the-tech-spooks-who-found-bin-laden-are-helping-bp-find-oil-9qddfpv2r)\n\nThis increase in production helps us to visualize just how useful Palantir\u2019s software can be. This is why their Foundry has been credited as a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d. Other oil producing companies most likely would not have been able to uncover the data, patterns, and relationships that were uncovered by Palantir, thus the companies that are not using Palantir may be losing out.\n\nThis type of publicity is fantastic for Palantir, as companies may see this, and contact Palantir because they too want a competitive advantage. Palantir\u2019s best chance at becoming the next \u201ctech giant\u201d comes through the commercial applications/contracts. This is because there are infinite uses for Palantir, so theoretically, they can get it in the hands of every business (which would help revenues to soar).\n\n**National Institute of Health (NIH) and Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS):**\n\nPalantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE. However, recently Palantir has been getting good press, which has helped their company image. Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir, for Palantir\u2019s assistance with their fights against COVID-19, and their vaccine distributions. This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID-19.\n\nThe NIH agreed to a [$36M contract](https://www.palantir.com/pt_media/nih-palantir-contract/) to gain a partnership with Palantir. Their (NIH\u2019s), mission is to build the largest centralized COVID-19 patient database in the world, and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success.\n\nPalantir was able to assist the NIH in building their [N3C data platform](https://covid.cd2h.org/). This platform has come a long way since they teamed up with Palantir, and now has over 7.1B rows of data from 6.5M patients, from 57 different databases. Without the assistance of Palantir, analyzing this amount of data would have been no easy feat, however Palantir has provided the NIH with advanced analytics in the matter of minutes thank to their machine learning capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, in December of 2020, Palantir signed a [2-year $31.5M deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201223005018/en/Palantir-Continues-Vital-NHS-Work-With-31.5M-Contract) with the Brittan\u2019s NHS. This partnership requires Foundry to provide a secure, reliable, and timely platform to process data, while protecting patient privacy, to ultimately improve patient care.\n\nBoth of these partnerships highlight the need for Palantir during a crisis and having these large Government Health Institutes choosing Palantir as their first options is a great deal, and shows their confidence in Palantir\u2019s software.\n\n*Sources:*\n\n[The power of data in a pandemic - Technology in the NHS (blog.gov.uk)](https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/28/the-power-of-data-in-a-pandemic/)\n\n*Strengths:*\n\n**Built-in Privacy Controls:**\n\nBy having [privacy controls](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU) in place, Palantir is able to operate in places that other data companies cannot go. This is especially true for Foundry, where companies/individuals can request cross-industry data from other Palantir clients to help them in a variety of ways. This request for external data needs to be accepted by a representative of the other company to be allowed. This helps Palantir leverage all of the data that they have on their \u201cOperating System\u201d, which essentially makes their platform a cross-company/cross-country collaborative workspace for all. As Palantir attains more clients, the more attractive/extensive their database is for potential clients. This should help Palantir to expand quickly once they get the ball rolling.\n\nPalantir truly values this privacy and has integrated data legibility, audit logs, access controls, quality checks and requirements to attain external data.\n\n**Government Grade Security:**\n\nAs we know, Palantir started out in just the defense and intelligence spaces. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the get-go. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This is no easy feat, however Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients, because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has [IL-5 clearance](https://simplemoneylyfe.com/palantir-stock-analysis/) with the Department of Defense (DoD), which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance (alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP). However, it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of **classified information.**\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.\n\n**Expansion into the Commercial Sector:**\n\nPalantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector, partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry.\n\nPalantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization/operations. Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector, and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises.\n\n*Government Contracts:*\n\nDo you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling? If so, you will know where I am headed with this section.\n\nBetween 2008-2018 (10 years), Palantir was able to generate $51.9M in revenue from government contracts. However, in the 2 years following this they earned $179.9M in Government contracts (this can be found under the \u201cUS Government\u201d section of their [SEC 10-K report](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)). Once Palantir was able to get the ball rolling with these agencies, Palantir was able to both expand and renew existing contracts to earn more revenue. I believe that the same thing will happen with Palantir\u2019s commercial operations. Once they start to get a large number of big enterprises renewing their contracts for \u201cbigger bucks\u201d, I believe that Palantir will start to grow their revenues extremely quick and attract new clients \u201cleft, right, and center\u201d.\n\nThese contract renewals are so important because essentially, they mean that Palantir met and/or exceeded expectations, and these companies now believe that Palantir is vital to their business/operations, so look out for news around renewals.\n\n*Business Model:*\n\nPalantir has developed a business model that focuses on acquiring contracts and expanding their services and has 3 main phases.\n\n1. **Acquire Customers:** Palantir has expanded their sales force largely over the past couple of years, and actively purse negotiations with companies that they can provide long-term value to. To acquire these companies, Palantir gives them a short demo to see how effective and user friendly their software is, Palantir provides this service for a loss. However, they are willing to incur these (proportionately) small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies. This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase.\n2. **Expand:** Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook, they move them along to the expand phase. Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes, of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it. These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost (Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well), however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir\u2019s software during this phase and see what it has to offer. If they like their software, they will be moved along to the next phase (scale) which is Palantir\u2019s bread and butter.\n3. **Scale:** These clients tend to sign longer-term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a \u201cgood feel\u201d for their software. The companies in this stage are also generally \u201chands-off\u201d meaning that they can operate the software without much help. Companies tend to find the most value in this stage, and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage. In 2020, Palantir made $613.4M in this stage with a margin of 70%\n\n*Financial information:*\n\nAll of this information can be found in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Palantir increased their gross profit by 47.97% and increased their gross margin to 81% (from 71%), Palantir reported their first net income (excluding stock-based compensation) ever and increase their net revenues by 47.15%.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Palantir\u2019s loss from operations increased by 103.61%, their stock-based compensation increased by 425.15%, their General and Admin expenses increased by 108.59%, and their net loss increased by 101.22%. Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock-based compensation, which will be addressed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Convertible Preferred Stock:** In 2020, Palantir issued a total of 797,771,675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous \u201cconvertible referred shares\u201d. This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s stock of 137.19%. This is a huge form of dilution, and I have never seen anything like this before, however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that.\n\n\u00b7 **Repurchase of Common Stock:** In 2020, Palantir repurchased 808,201 shares back. This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock, however any buyback is good to see as an investor. This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0.14%, which is not much, but we will still take it.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Warrants:** In 2020, Palantir experienced an additional 7,631,329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants. The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir\u2019s stock of 1.31%.\n\n\u00b7 **Common Stock (Net of Issuance Costs):** In 2020, Palantir unloaded 206,500,523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs. I believe that this means that, Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public. I could very well be wrong on that, and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great! Anyways, this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s common stock of roughly 35.51%. This is a large portion of dilution, however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir added 120,617,527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options. These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20.72%. Once again, this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors.\n\n\u00b7 **RSU\u2019s:** In 2020, Palantir issued 82,429,575 shares through their vesting of \u201cRestricted Stock Units\u201d (RSU\u2019s). This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14.18% (which is a lot of dilution).\n\n\u00b7 **Modification to Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir technically bought back 3,500,0000 shares through modifications to stock options (for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options). Confusing, right? This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0.6%.\n\n\u00b7 **Total Share Dilution in 2020:** In 2020, Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208.19%. This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed, however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020.\n\n*Explanation of Share Dilution:*\n\nOnce again, all of the below information can be found in Palantir\u2019s [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1).\n\nOn September 30th, 2020, Palantir completed their Direct Listing of their Class A common shares on the public markets on the NYSE. Part of this listing involved the redemption of all of Palantir\u2019s convertible share into common shares. This was the largest single source of dilution in Palantir (137%). Additionally, this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants, which resulted in dilution of 1.31%. Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued, net of issuance price to complete the direct listing, which had a dilutionary effect of 35.51%. Lastly, Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU\u2019s, which cause a dilutionary effect of 14.18%.\n\nWithout these factors of dilution, Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20%. This means that due to the Direct listing, Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188.19% to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing.\n\n*Overall Thoughts on Dilution:*\n\nPalantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution, and I have not seen anything quite like this before. Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors. However, we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing. However, how does Palantir dilution (excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years?\n\nFor starters, Palantir exhibited a 20% share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing. However, historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5.18% between 2017-2019. So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing, Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution. However, 20% of dilution is significantly different than the 208.19% of dilution (which would be crazily high). This 20% is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock, such as Palantir, so currently I would not be too worried. However, investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021, because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir\u2019s dilution after going public, than their past share dilution as a private company.\n\n*Competition:*\n\nIn order to undergo my comparable analyses (which will be discussed later on) I needed to select 4 companies, that I can compare to Palantir.\n\n[**$ZS \u2013 Zscaler Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/ZS)**:** ZScaler is a security as a service company that helps company adapt to cloud technologies and provides their cybersecurity services through the cloud. ZScaler provides their services to both commercial enterprises and governments, similar to that of Palantir. Furthermore, ZScaler offers their service primarily in the USA, but also has smaller international operations (again like Palantir).\n\n[**$SNOW \u2013 Snowflake Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SNOW)**:** Snowflake (like Palantir) is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data. Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering, data science, data applications, data sharing, and data warehouse. This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir, however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves. Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations, similar to that of Palantir.\n\n[**$SPLK \u2013 Splunk Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SPLK)**:** Splunk provide software platforms that deliver insights derived from their clients\u2019 data in the USA and internationally. Splunk offers their Ecosystem solutions that consist of data inputs, workflows, reports, dashboards, data visualizations, actions, and methods, and help their clients/customers to make the best out of their data. All of this sounds eerily familiar to the description of Palantir, making it one of the closer competitors. Splunk also offers their services to the public sector as well as the government, making their business model resemble that of Palantir so much more.\n\n[**$TYL \u2013 Tyler technologies Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/TYL)**:** Tyler technologies is probably the company in this list that least resembles that of Palantir, this is because they provide management solutions, accounting systems, billing systems and other solutions geared toward the public sector. Tyler technologies works primarily with governments of all types (Federal, State, and Municipal), and education institutions. However, the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions. Their data insights software enables collaboration, displays data visualizations/measurements, and generates insights for their human operators to act on.\n\n*Q1 2021 Updates:*\n\nAll of the below information can be found in [Palantir\u2019s Q1 Investor Presentation](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q1%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf).\n\nRecently, on May 11th, 2021, Palantir released their Q1 earnings report. When looking at Palantir\u2019s financial performance I did not take this into account, which means that this section will be packed with new information that will help us to understand Palantir\u2019s trajectory even more.\n\nFirst and foremost, this quarter was the first quarter in which Palantir has reported positive earnings. This is a big milestone for Palantir as a public company, and it helps to gets investors excited about the potentially profitable future of Palantir. In Q1, Palantir reported a free cash flow of $151M (was -$290M in Q1 2020) with a 44% adjusted FCF margin, they grew revenues by 49% YoY ($341M), and they grew billings by 248% YoY ($362M) which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts. These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir, which should excite their investors.\n\nFurthermore, during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC. This SPAC is [$QELL \u2013 Qell Acquisition Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/QELL) which merging with Lilium. Lilium is an eVTOL transportation company, with this investment they also came to a deal with Lilium to use Foundry for design, engineering, testing, production, quality, logistics, and operations. A while back I looked at another eVTOL SPAC Archer ([$ACIC \u2013 Atlas Crest Investment Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/ACIC)), which has great upside and has a similar business model to Lilium, so if you want to read that to be more informed about Liliums potential performance, [click here.](https://utradea.com/positions/Take_a_SHOT_at_Archers_SPAC_ACIC)\n\nIn Q1, Palantir was also awarded with a [5-year $90M contract](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210405005238/en/Palantir-Selected-by-the-National-Nuclear-Security-Administration-for-5-year-89.9M-Contract-for-SAFER-Project) from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER (Safety Analytics, Forecasting, and Evaluation Reporting) project. This is big news as this is one of Palantir\u2019s bigger contracts, and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir\u2019s software and their cross-enterprise data integration capabilities. On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations, the DoD used Palantir\u2019s software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence. This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right, and if the DoD likes it so much, then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises.\n\nLastly, in Q1, Palantir won 15 contracts worth over $5M, and 6 contracts worth over $10M with an average duration of 3.7 years (4.6 for commercial customers). This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this, and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal/negotiations. Additionally, Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83% (from 75% Q1 2020), and their contribution margin to 60% (from 41% in Q1 2020). This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase, the scale phase, which enables Palantir to grow their margins.\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Investment Valuation:***\n\n*Comparable Analyses:*\n\nI decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations (or opinions if you will). Preferably, I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate, however, if they are not consistent, I will take the average result. I was only able to find 2 multiples/ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios/multiples.\n\n*EV/Revenue:*\n\nThis is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet, like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies. By comparing Palantir\u2019s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (listed above on the \u201ccompetitors\u201d section of this report), I found that Palantir has a fair value of $32.85/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 23.31%. This implies that given Palantir\u2019s current price, they are undervalued, and the upside is very reasonable, however, I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains.\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Palantir\u2019s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $24.87/share, which implies that there is a downside risk of 6.64% to such an investment. As you have probably noticed, these results are not consistent, therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one, final price target.\n\n*Average Comparable:*\n\nBy taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $28.86/share, which implies an overall upside of 8.36% to this investment. This also implies that Palantir, is in fact an undervalued growth stock, that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market.\n\n***My Plan for Investing into Palantir:***\n\nMy plan for this investment is a little different from usual.\n\nI see anything between $24.87/share (Fair Value of P/B ratio) and $28.86/share (average comparable) as a good chance to buy Palantir at (or below) its fair value. This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment.\n\nHowever, I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long-run 3+ years. I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3+ years. During this time, I would re-evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding.\n\n***Potential Risks to Palantir\u2019s Stock - $PLTR:***\n\n\u00b7 **Dilution:** Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution, however, we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing. However, the 20% of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high. As investors, we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns/increases that we should be weary of. If these levels of dilution persist, potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions, which will hurt the share price.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** This year\u2019s financial performance was not one to be overly happy about. Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet, Palantir was still yet to make a profit, and increased their net losses by over 100%. If this poor financial performance continues, and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole, investors will run away from this stock and never look back. However, the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future, which will be discussed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Bad Press:** Historically, Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non-investors alike. Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through [Palantir\u2019s partnership with ICE](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54348456). Palantir quicky spoke out against this backlash by saying ICE took advantage of their software without proper oversight, and that they are looking into the issues, furthermore they have since declined some potential partnerships with other border agencies to avoid further backlash. There have also been numerous smaller controversies and protests that have damaged Palantir\u2019s reputation, and if there are more large controversies Palantir\u2019s stock could get hurt as a result of it.\n\n***Potential Catalysts that can Help Palantir\u2019s Stock Price:***\n\n\u00b7 **Share Buybacks:** Over the past year, Palantir has bought back (both directly and indirectly, in a sense) over 4,300,000 of their common shares. This is good to see as an investor, especially this early in the company (and not too long after their Direct Listing). This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future. This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares, and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** Palantir\u2019s 2020 financial report was not favourable (as discussed previously), however there were definitely some good to take out of it. Palantir increased their revenue, gross profit, and margins by a hefty amount, which is good to see as an investor, however, there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable. However, their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report.\n\n\u00b7 **Positive Press:** As previously mentioned, Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price. However, recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID-19, and their vaccine distribution efforts. Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir\u2019s technology. Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company. This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released.\n\n\u00b7 **Success Stories:** Since Palantir have gone public, they have had a few success stories come out, I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article. These success stories show how impactful Palantir\u2019s software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues, production etc. just by using Palantir\u2019s software. Any future stories like this that come out, highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar, and potential clients to reach out and start business/inquiries with Palantir.\n\n\u00b7 **Renewing Contracts:** I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir\u2019s share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case? This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir\u2019s 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years. After their time with Palantir\u2019s software expires they decide to renew the contract. This is good because it shows that Palantir\u2019s software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these $5-15M+ contract renewals. Furthermore, these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir\u2019s installation, and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins, which will reflect well on Palantir\u2019s future financial reports.\n\n\u00b7 **New Partnerships/Contracts (and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment):** Every time that Palantir, or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract/agreement, this will help Palantir\u2019s stock. This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections. Furthermore, as more commercial enterprises try Palantir\u2019s software (and hopefully enjoy it), the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot. I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry. Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment, and as more contracts role in, more enterprises will take an interest. Furthermore, when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract, it will help to increase their revenues, which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the, to beat estimates.\n\n*This analysis took a long time, and is one of the most comprehensive that I have seen, so I would greatly appreciate if you followed me* [*here*](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/BeatingTheVTI?utm_source=R&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=PLTR)*, and commented on my original post!*",

        "selftext": "So I read this article by Angela Harmantas from Proactive Investors today and it made me question things. Here\u2019s a quote: \n\n&gt;**It has been said that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the remote economy, but is that really true?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Before the pandemic hit in 2020, around 5% of Americans worked out of the home, but by the spring of that year\u00a0that number had **skyrocketed to 60%.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kalish estimates that the remote economy is a \u201c**multi-trillion-dollar global marketplace**\u201d that has room for multiple players, many of which are just starting out. \u201cIt may seem like this is a mature economy, but I believe we\u2019re on the ground floor of opportunities in this tech space.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cAdopting any kind of flexibility to function in a remote world is going to be the new normal,\u201d Kalish said. **\u201cYou can be a doctor without an office, or a professor without a lecture room.\u201d**\n\nThe article you can see here [Xigem Technologies sees multiple opportunities to help companies make the shift to the remote economy](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/954785/xigem-technologies-sees-multiple-opportunities-to-help-companies-make-the-shift-to-the-remote-economy-954785.html)\n\nThe first question, I can\u2019t find a direct definition for the \"remote economy\". I'm somewhat new to it, I know gig economy, sharing economy, but not remote economy. **What is it?** \n\nI get the general idea, but my best description is \u201cyou know, all this sh#t that started in 2019\u201d. I know that it will most likely bring me gains, i FEEL what it is, but I don\u2019t want to invest in \u201call this sh#t\u201d. it would be hard to explain lol. Some better words are needed. \n\nThey don't give the definition, mention the options: \n\n**$XIGM Xigem** \\- the subject of the article, so hard to be unbiased here for them, I guess. I already bought 700 shares a week ago in case of a shot anyway, revenue is promised in Q3, but so far it\u2019s a high risk - high win. And most importantly - it\u2019s just one stock;  \n\n**$CRM SalesForce** \\- it\u2019s growing, it looks promising, I like it, but it costs damn $246,3 per share. It\u2019s not a penny; \n\n**$ORCL Oracle** \\- 44% in the last 6 months, real \u00abremote economy\u00bb stock, but not a penny, it\u2019s $87,5 for share. \n\nI\u2019m a good-ol\u2019 rebel, so I tried to come up with **other ideas**. My best guesses, NOTE - before the DD on each of them: \n\n**$XELA - Exela tech**, business solutions, transactions management, and all that stuff. The stock that actually made me do the 2+2 with Xigem article, because it shot 48% up today, and it\u2019s 236% up in the last 6 months. No idea why and I wish I noticed it before. Guess I\u2019m late here. \n\n**$PIXY - ShiftPixy**, looks good and fits in the article, especially in the \u00abprofessor without a classroom\u00bb part, just for anyone. Basically a remote gig economy stock. Cheapie as well: $2,14 for share. Falling, but don\u2019t know yet whether any catalysts will be in the nearest future. \n\nI\u2019ve had a good, professional and in-depth discussion with my imaginary friends this whole morning, and now I invite you to join. **The main question:** \n\nWhat exactly is Remote Economy and what companies should shoot up on this train? Any other companies position themselves as providers for this this multi-trillion-dollar thing like Xigem, or they\u2019re the first ones in it? Given that the whole remote thing is not going anywhere, how to make money on it? \n\nBonus question for those in $XELA or $PIXY - am I late?",

        "selftext": "\\*I am new to Chainlink and this is my initial research/understanding, if you can correct me, or help me to understand more about Chainlink, please do in the comments\\*\n\n***Summary:***\n\nChainlink (LINK-USD) is a decentralized network that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Chainlink provides off-chain data/information to the blockchain, making it on-chain data that can be used for smart contracts via their Decentralized Oracle Networks (DON\u2019s).\n\nChainlink has been able to revolutionize smart contracts through the integration of off-chain data. This is because the off-chain data allows for exponentially more use cases for these smart contracts, which may help us adopt crypto faster than previously thought.\n\nIn the future, Chainlink plans to improve upon their anonymity (where they can and where it makes sense) and implementing what they call \u201cmeta contracts\u201d.\n\nNote: There will be a list of definitions at the end of this article to help clarify some general and technical terms used throughout this analysis.\n\n***The History of Chainlink:***\n\nThe Chainlink protocol was created in 2017, they were able to do this through a $32M round of funding. Chainlink\u2019s main goal is to solve the Oracle problem so that the power of the blockchain can be unlocked and adapted quicker. Chainlink aims to do this through their DON\u2019s.\n\nThrough their network, Chainlink is able to provide Price feeds (useful for DeFi), verifiable randomness, proof of reserve, the Keeper network, and more.\n\nRecently, they have released Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper, which broadens the capabilities of their Decentralized Oracle Networks, provides tamper-proof data delivery, and secure off-chain computation. This update was made to make Chainlink even more scalable by providing more security, privacy, and authenticity.\n\nLastly, this update lowers Chainlink\u2019s gas (transaction) price of Oracle updates by 90%.\n\n***General Information:***\n\nChainlink is a fixed supply coin and has a supply cap of 1B coins (currently there is only 435.51M coins in supply).\n\nCurrently, Chainlink has a price of $19.05 (USD), and is actively traded, with their volume being approximately $1B traded in the last 24 hours.\n\nChainlink has a market cap of $8.38B, making it the current 15th largest cryptocurrency. Furthermore, their fully diluted market cap is $19.25B.\n\nChainlink\u2019s (1B) token supply is distributed as follows:\n\n\u00b7 **Company:** 300M of their tokens are reserved/allocated to their parent company (Smartcontract.com). This number fairly standard and it is good that this is not higher, because the higher this number, the more likely a rug pull, and less of a potential upside.\n\n\u00b7 **Community Holders:** 350M of their tokens are reserved for their holders, investors, and community. This number being so high is good for Chainlink because it gives them the potential to have big returns.\n\n\u00b7 **Node Operators:** The other 350M tokens are reserved for Chainlink\u2019s node operators. This is also good to see such a large allocation of tokens to them.\n\n***Chainlink\u2019s Decentralized Oracle Network (DON):***\n\nChainlink is able to bring real world data to the Chainlink network and blockchain, through their DON\u2019s. This is especially important when looking at the application of Chainlink\u2019s smart contracts because DON\u2019s were made specifically to enhance and extend the capabilities of these contracts. **By utilizing a DON, Chainlink is able to improve upon existing smart contracts because they can now be connected to the real world**.\n\nDON\u2019s offer networking, storage, and computation systems, while providing confidentiality, integrity, and accountability. These are offered through 2 functions of DON\u2019s, executables, and adopters.\n\n\u00b7 *Executables:* Programs that run continuously, and in a decentralized manner to improve performance and allows for confidential computation, which will be discussed in-depth later. Executables run and perform their operations on Chainlink\u2019s DON, working hand-in-hand with adapters to link external data.\n\n\u00b7 *Adapters:* Adapters (when working in DON\u2019s) can send and retrieve data from off-DON systems, operate bidirectionally, and leverage joint computation to achieve more features (ie. Encryption for privacy)\n\n**Adapters communicate information from web servers to executables, then communicate the information from the executable to the blockchain. This is how Chainlink is able to fetch their off-chain data for their DON\u2019s (which consist of the executable and storage).**\n\nAn example of how this works is given through Chainlink\u2019s founder (Seregey Nazarov) in a podcast with Lex Fridman, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXTmVdlyoc).\n\nNazarov described their DON and smart contract capabilities through an example of crop insurance. Where he went on to say they could use their smart contracts that run on Ethereum to make crop insurance contracts between a farmer in Bolivia and an insurance company in America, in which the farmer gets paid if it does not rain for let\u2019s say 14 days straight. Chainlink\u2019s smart contracts can collect external data from 5-7 different and trusted API\u2019s (could be weather stations, radars, local news channels etc.) to determine how long it has not rained for, and if the period of time that it has not rained is verified and 14 days (as stated in the hypothetical contract), the contract will be executed, and the farmer will be compensated. This is a game changer and allows people (like farmers in Bolivia) to hedge their risk, which would never have been available to them otherwise. And all of this runs on DON\u2019s, adapters, and executables on Chainlink\u2019s system.\n\n*This technology, combined with smart contracts, has never been seen before, and has enormous potential in terms of future use cases.*\n\n***Hybrid Smart Contracts:***\n\nChainlink refers to their \u201chybrid smart contracts\u201d as combining on-chain and off-chain components securely. These hybrid contracts are what differentiates Chainlink from the thousands of other cryptocurrencies out there.\n\nChainlink saw a problem in the way smart contracts were previously operated as they were very limited in their uses, slow to execute, and overall expensive. So Chainlink decided to go all in on improving on the use cases for these contracts through the adoption of off-chain components to the blockchain. One of the use cases that Chainlink solved can be seen in the Crop Insurance example above.\n\nChainlink has been able to adopt this off-chain information through their DON\u2019s, which enable them to offer these hybrid smart contracts. Chainlink still recognize that there is a long way to go to further improve on their technology and add new features like anonymity which they plan to address in the future.\n\nHybrid contracts are the first step involved in eventually reaching \u201cmeta contracts\u201d which Chainlink believes will revolutionize the way in which we use crypto. Bringing us closer being able to transform the current monetary system into a digital one.\n\n*Example:*\n\nThis kind of technology has various uses that can improve the efficiency for all parties involved. Once again, I will use an example from the Lex Fridman podcast with Sergey Nazarov, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXTmVdlyoc)\n\nIn this podcast Sergey pointed out that this confidentiality technology could be used in the data marketplace very effectively. This is because there is one party who is buying the data (person A); however this party does not know the quality of the data they are purchasing from the other party (person B). Based on this fact, person A does not want to pay for person B\u2019s data because they do not yet know the quality, and Person B does not want to send the data over to person A for a quality check because then they would be giving it away for free. However, Chainlink\u2019s smart contracts provide a solution to this problem because their smart contracts can work as an impartial agent, because of the fact that they can process off-chain data. This ensures that Person B gets paid and knows nothing about person A\u2019s data algorithm, Person A gets their data automatically placed in their algorithm to keep person A\u2019s data private.\n\nThis process would work like this:\n\n\u00b7 Person A provides their funds and states what data they are looking for\n\n\u00b7 Person B provides their data\n\no Chainlink assesses this data by taking random cross-sections of this data and internally assesses the quality and potential match based on Person A\u2019s criteria.\n\no Chainlink determines the fair price of the data for both parties.\n\n\u00b7 If both parties agree upon the price, then the contract is executed and the transaction is approved.\n\n***Confidentiality:***\n\nBlockchains by their nature are very transparent. However, many people value confidentiality and would like to see some sort of confidentiality on the blockchain where it makes sense. This inherent transparency clashes with peoples desires for confidentiality and needs to be addressed in a way that makes sense for the users and for the blockchains.\n\nChainlink has proposed some ways in which they can implement confidentiality in their system to accommodate the need for confidentiality. These proposals include a combination of the following:\n\n\u00b7 *Confidentiality-Preserving Adapters:* Two technologies (DECO and Town Crier) enable oracle nodes to retrieve data from off-chain systems in ways that protect user privacy and data confidentiality.\n\n\u00b7 *Confidential Computation:* DON\u2019s can conceal their computations from blockchains to a certain extent.\n\n\u00b7 *Supported Confidential Layer-2 Systems:* Many layer-2 systems use zero-knowledge proofs to provide various forms of transaction confidentiality.\n\nThis kind of confidentiality is very important to people and has many cases where it can be used effectively. Once again, I will use an example from the Lex Fridman podcast with Sergey Nazarov, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXTmVdlyoc)\n\nThe example that he gave was with health insurance companies in which he explained the following. Through Chainlink, you can have a smart contract that hold a person\u2019s data and evaluates the data of the user (ie. Age, sex, medical history, medical conditions etc.) without sharing it to the insurance company. However, the insurance company will know that the smart contract will be able to effectively evaluate the patient properly and give them a policy with a price that fits their information. This solves the confidentiality worry about providing this data over the internet/blockchain and is only one example of a potential use case in which having confidentiality does not have an impact on the outcome of a result.\n\n***Trust Minimization:***\n\nChainlink\u2019s goal is to create a trustworthy layer of support for smart contracts through decentralization and crypto economic guarantees. This is because users favour a trust model for smart contracts made possible through Chainlink\u2019s DON\u2019s. Chainlink is always working on ways to improve their trustworthiness and security, and already have the following measures in place to ensure this right now.\n\n\u00b7 *Data-Source Authentication:* Data provides sign their data to ensure it is correct which helps to strengthen the relationship between the contracts and the data.\n\n\u00b7 *DON Minority Reports:* Flags can be issued and examined when there is malfeasance in the DON.\n\n\u00b7 *Guard Rails:* Detects anomalous conditions and halts the execution of the contract if it is suspicious.\n\n\u00b7 *Trust-Minimized Governance:* Gradual-release updates facilitate inspection and intervention in the case of a system failure.\n\nFurthermore, there is incentives for people when they help to identify and solve cryptoeconomic security concerns.\n\n***Chainlink Staking:***\n\nStaking in Chainlink is very different from staking in other cryptocurrencies. Staking in Chainlink is aimed to ensure the timely delivery of correct oracle reports. Chainlink\u2019s approach to staking is as follows:\n\n1. *Adversarial Model:* Covers attacks that are overlooked, such as prospective bribery (bribing nodes)\n2. *Super-Linear Staking Impact:* An adversary must have a budget greater than the combined deposits in all of the oracle nodes (which is large due to staking in these nodes)\n3. *Implicit-Incentive Framework (IIF):* Chainlink\u2019s incentive model that stretches beyond explicit, deposited, staking funds.\n\n***Transaction Execution Framework (TEF):***\n\nA TEF is an approach to the efficient execution of a Smart Contract across a mainchain and a DON. A TEF can support any layer-2 execution techniques, allowing it to process smart contract transactions. The TEF allows Chainlink to do so confidentially, with lower fees, and with higher performance. The TEF can do this because of the following functions:\n\n\u00b7 *Transaction Ingestion:* Executes, receives, or fetches user transactions through DON\u2019s or the mainchain.\n\n\u00b7 *Fast Execution:* Processes transactions locally (on the DON)\n\n\u00b7 *Low-cost Oracle &amp; Adapter Access:* Reduced cost through off-chain oracle access (on-chain storage is expensive).\n\n\u00b7 *Syncing:* Periodically updates their smart contracts.\n\n***Node Reputation and Performance History:***\n\nChainlink documents the performance histories of their nodes on the chain. Users can reference the past operations/performances of these nodes to make informed decisions. This decentralized compilation of accurate performing histories allows both users and operators to build their reputations to distinguish themselves on Chainlink\u2019s network. Something like this can be very important in the future for insurance companies or any other companies adopt Chainlink\u2019s technology, this is because users will be able to see the satisfaction scores and previous performances of these companies before they decide to do business.\n\nAn example may be an insurance company. By having performance histories, users can see if other users have been satisfied with their services, how many claims that they have settled, how many claims have been neglected, and how many customers this company serves. This gives very important information to the user, as they decide which company, they want to do business with. Furthermore, this history makes companies to compete for the best satisfaction and successful claims rate, in order to beat out their competition.\n\n***Exciting News:***\n\nAugur is launching a new platform to capture the quickly growing sports betting market. This new platform is called \u201cAugur Turbo\u201d. Augur has decided to use a combination of Polygon Matic $MATIC and Chainlink $LINK in order to decentralize their sports betting, reduce their fees, and improve their services.\n\nAugur will use $MATIC to keep their fees low (due to their very low gas fees.\n\nAugur will use $LINK for their Oracles, allowing them to transfer up-to-the-second, real-world data to the blockchain to help their increase their speed of adjusting the odds, updating the stats/scores, and paying their bettors out after the conclusion of their match(es).\n\n*Source:*\n\n[Augur Adds Sports Betting With Launch of Polygon-Based 'Augur Turbo' - CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/augur-adds-sports-betting-with-launch-of-polygon-based-augur-turbo)\n\n***Key Definitions:***\n\n\u00b7 **Oracle:** An oracle sends data from off-chain sources (ie. Temperature information) to a blockchain, namely Ethereum, which then transforms it to on-chain data. This data is then used in applications like smart contracts.\n\n\u00b7 **Decentralized Oracle Networks (DON\u2019s):** DON\u2019s are formed by committees of oracle nodes that cooperate in order to fulfill a specific task to provide persistent services to clients. DON\u2019s are a powerful tool that helps developers create off-chain support for smart contracts.\n\n\u00b7 **Verifiable Randomness:** Several types of developer applications require a verifiably correct source of randomness to enable verification. An example of this is a PoolTogether, where a promotion promises to give 5 lucky winners $50 in $LINK. This randomness will select these winners and automatically pay them out (via smart contracts) ensuring that their contest is legitimate and truly random.\n\n\u00b7 **Off-Chain:** Transactions, and/or data that takes place in the real world and can be put into a blockchain via Chainlink.\n\n\u00b7 **On-Chain:** This consists of transaction and/or data that is registered/recorded on some blockchain technology.\n\n\u00b7 **Smart Contract:** A Smart contract is a self-executing contract with terms that must be met by both sides for the contract to be executed. These contracts are traceable but irreversible. An example of this would be the sending me an automatic release of $50 in $LINK on my birthday. This smart contract would have to know my birth date, however once it does, a smart contract will execute every year on my birthday sending me this money.\n\n\u00b7 **Fixed Supply:** This means that there is a limit to the amount of supply, and that more supply of a coin cannot be created.\n\n\u00b7 **Fully Diluted Market Cap:** This refers to the market cap of a coin, given their maximum supply at current prices.\n\n\u00b7 **Node:** A node is a computer that connects and supports a given cryptocurrency network. The computer works on validating and relaying transactions onto the blockchain.\n\n\u00b7 **Oracle Node:** A committee of nodes with the goal of supporting/working alongside existing blockchains, rather than providing its own separate functionality.\n\n\u00b7 **Proof of Reserve:** Chainlinks Proof of Reserve (PoR) is the solution for maintaining end-to-end transparency for any platform utilizing backed/wrapped assets.\n\n\u00b7 **Keeper Network:** The Keeper Network is a decentralized network for projects that need software development and IT operations (DevOps) and eternal teams to find keeper networks (jobs).\n\n\u00b7 **Node Operators:** Chainlinks node operators are the backbone of their network. These operators participate in DON\u2019s, allowing engineers to fetch external data securely/reliably via API\u2019s. These operators are crucial for smart contracts and the real world data they need to use to run properly.\n\n\u00b7 **API\u2019s (Application Programming Interface):** API\u2019s provide real time data, by letting one software application to interact with another. Chainlink uses API\u2019s to take real-time, and real-world data and transfer the into the blockchain through their DON\u2019s.\n\n\u00b7 **Staking:** Actively participating in validating transactions, anyone who meets the minimum staking (balance) requirements can participate and earn rewards. Staking locks up your holdings and earns interest.\n\nIf you appreciate this research and want to see more research on other crypto's in the future, follow me [here](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/CryptoCranium)",

THE MARKET CAP DISPLAYED IS THE SPACS MARKET CAP WHICH IS NO LONGER RELEVANT AND INCORRECT. *****\n\nRead first, thank me later. **AvePoint (ticker: AVPT), the Largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider was just listed publicly on Nasdaq last week.**\n\n**// About AvePoint**\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:\n\n* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dz089c2qxs971.png?width=2336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e3fe9e8a12840a67f2503570910b255758bc53f\n\nCompany's Footprint\n\n* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \\~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company\u2019s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC). The Company sells directly to large and mid-market enterprises, and its solutions are also available to managed services providers on more than 100 cloud marketplaces globally. Regarding Microsoft, the company \u201cBridges the Gap Between What Microsoft Cloud Offers and What the Enterprise Requires\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qslefg2rxs971.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2147d70bf7dcc0029eb0bcdbad6ad605c8f2b15f\n\nBlue-Chip Client Base\n\n* Compared to other recent SPAC deals and business combinations we just saw, AvePoint has indeed a great track record. Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uar3z93sxs971.png?width=2676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7bada89e321ec83b63a02159e86304d0f824eee\n\nStrong Financials\n\n* Great market trends. Explosive data growth, increasing data regulations, shifts to the cloud, hyper growth of Microsoft Teams were all trends that fuelled the growth prior to the pandemic. The impacts of COVID-19 have greatly accelerated these trends\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmg70q8txs971.png?width=2704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89e9040fe7eb9a66370f36afac1f0b44af9a85d3\n\nCurrent and Future Potential\n\n* The company raised $200 million in January this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs. The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before the reverse merger announcement\n\nAbout Apex Tech that merged with Avepoint:\n\n* Outstanding management: led by Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein (\\*cough\\* didn\u2019t kill himself \\*cough\\*) and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig. Their combined experience includes more than 100 technology IPOs, Served on 20 boards and advisory boards and saw mergers involving companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Ebay,, Dell, Yahoo! and Twilio\n* Apex\u2019s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex SPAC and the private investment owners.

        "selftext": " You will see the full analysis below, but its a bit of a read, so here\u2019s the exec sum:\n\n* **Product:** Bill.com is a fintech platform that helps small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) streamline and automate billing and payment processes that most SMBs still perform manually.\n* **Revenue model:** 49% fixed-fee recurring, 49% usage-based \u201crecurring in nature\u201d, 2% float interest.\n* **Market size:** $9 billion domestically, $30 billion globally. Strong pandemic-driven momentum.\n* **Go-to-market:** Direct and indirect via channel partners (most major accounting firms, accounting software providers and financial institutions).\n* **Competition:** Several competing solutions available, new challenger start-ups and competitors entering from adjacent market segments.\n* **M&amp;A:** Bill.com is in the process of acquiring spend management company Divvy for $2.5 billion ($625 million in cash, rest in shares). Divvy has $100 million in annual revenue, growing 100% YoY.\n* **Financials:** Strong financial performance based on high revenue growth, good customer retention and on-target operating efficiency. Company will need to prove ability to maintain growth while turning profitable.\n* **Valuation:** The total enterprise value (TEV) of $16.4 billion implies a TEV / NTM revenue multiple of 59x. Comparable companies are valued at 20x - 25x.\n* **Conclusion:** High-quality company with an excessive price tag. Share price likely to decline to market standard levels. Target PPS: $100 (-54%), in 6 - 12 months\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    Product \n\nInvoicing and payment processes can be messy and physical documents are prone to human error, which can lead to incorrect or delayed payments. This is where Bill.com comes into the picture. Its platform automatically fills out invoices or recognizes information on incoming invoices, including supplier details and payment amounts, reducing the time for data entry and the likelihood of manual errors.\n\nThe platform offers automated field entries, bill approval and payment. Then, it is synced with the accounting software such as QuickBooks for reconciliation of accounting entries and bookkeeping. The integration between Bill.com and the accounting software eliminates double entry and human errors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8935sq7kpc971.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478cf108c612f0e3a11537bceaceca021fc1a693\n\nIts payment tools enable remote approval and automated payments to suppliers via ACH, wire transfers or PayPal. The company\u2019s bill payment feature enables customers to make electronic payments to suppliers outside the US and, compared to banks, the company\u2019s transaction fees are more competitive. For example, banks usually charge an average of $38 as wire transfers fee whereas Bill.com charges almost 4 times less with its International Payments solution, providing costs savings to its customers. According to the company, it offers payments options to over 130 countries with a supplier network of over 2.5 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2afv204lpc971.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de1287971b64ee952f288b9ba858a407dee2787f\n\n    Revenue Model \n\nThe company earns revenues through **subscription** and **transaction fees** as well as **interest** on transactions held.\n\nIn the last quarter, which ended in March 2021, 49% of total revenues were recurring based on per user pricing for use of the platform as a fixed monthly or annual payment. Another 49% was transaction revenue, which represents usage-based fees collected for each transaction processed through the platform. The remaining 2% are float revenue, which is interest earned from customer funds while payment transactions are clearing.\n\nWhile 49% recurring revenue is very low compared to other SaaS businesses, it is fair to say that the other 49% transaction revenue are for the most part \u201crecurring in nature\u201d: A customer who only has access to the platform but does not have any transactions (let\u2019s say a payment of accounts payables), will not pay transaction fees. But customers have a certain number of transactions each month for which they will pay. The number of these may fluctuate to some degree, but for the most part, they can be seen as recurring.\n\n    Market Size \n\nIn 2018, there were approximately 30 million SMBs in the US. While 24 million of these SMBs are sole-proprietors, the company focuses on serving the over 6 million employer firms, because SMBs large enough to have employees tend to have a greater need for more advanced accounts payable and accounts receivable processes in their back offices.\n\nBy multiplying the average revenue per customer of $1,500 by the 6 million domestic employer firms and 20 million (sufficiently large) SMBs globally, the total annual addressable market for the company can be estimated at **$9 billion domestically** and **$30 billion worldwide**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss84shvlpc971.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c2afb1c0a258ea700a0f2a3f81c0ab66f8fa40a\n\n    Go-To-Market \n\nBill.com acquires customers **directly** through digital marketing and inside sales, and **indirectly** through accounting firms and strategic partners including accounting software companies and financial institutions.\n\nIts partner base includes over 80 of the top 100 accounting firms in the US and several of the largest financial institutions, including **Bank of America, JPMorgan and American Express**. Bill.com\u2019s platform can be integrated with many of the major accounting software providers including companies such as **QuickBooks Online, Xero, Sage Intacct and Oracle NetSuite**, who dominate the accounting software market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o185frxmpc971.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd6508266264d04174de9d56ee2f298f73b3dfb9\n\nBill.com\u2019s integration with major accounting software and partnerships with financial institutions provides the company with an avenue to expand its market reach. However, the accounting software vendors could quickly turn from partners into competitors if they decide to provide similar services. Also, there is nothing stopping the partnered banks from collaborating with competitors in the future. On the contrary, it would be in the bank\u2019s and accounting firms\u2019 interests to work with several providers besides Bill.com.\n\n**To summarize,** the company\u2019s partnerships and integrations are valuable assets in its go-to-market approach. However, they are not a competitive moat.\n\n    Competition \n\nA range of other companies are offering good competing solutions. Differentiation can come from the breadth of the product offering or integrations with complementary systems like accounting, banking or ERP software.\n\nWith a user friendly and mature product, the company was well positioned to benefit from the move to digital that accelerated in 2020 and H1-2021 due to the pandemic. But while the company has an early-mover network advantage with various leading financial accounting software providers, financial institutions and accounting firms, competitive pressures are certain to increase in the future as various challenger companies are emerging and players from adjacent markets enter the competition to get a piece of the cake.\n\nFor example, payables automation solution provider **Tipalti**, who is valued at $2 billion. The company has stronger focus on enterprise customers and already counts player like Twitter, Twitch, Roblox, Roku, National Geographic, Business Insider and many other names to its customer base.\n\nAdditionally, cloud-based business spending management platform **Coupa** (COUP) has a TEV of $20 billion and is expected to generate ca. $540 million in revenue this year. Coupa provides companies control and visibility into how they spend money but also offers invoice automation and billing services similar to Bill.com\u2019s.\n\n    Divvy M&amp;A \n\nIn early June, Bill.com announced that it is going to acquired Divvy, a corporate spend management \u201cstartup\u201d. The total purchase price of around $2.5 billion is substantially above the company\u2019s roughly $1.6 billion post-money valuation that Divvy set in its January 2021 financing round. $625 million will be paid in cash, the remainder in shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8km8tvrnpc971.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0cbc696d6ee515f192146887d4c31d0a66583fd\n\n**Divvy by the numbers:**\n\n* $100 million annualized revenue\n* \\&gt;100% revenue growth YoY\n* $4 billion annualized total payment volume (TPV)\n\nSo Divvy sold for around 25x its current revenue-run-rate and the growth rate tells us that the company did not sell due to performance weakness.\n\n**Strategic rationale for the acquisition**: Bill.com extends its platform with Divvy\u2019s complementary spend management capabilities and therefore expands its overall market opportunity by serving a larger share of the customer\u2019s spend. Additionally, buying a company with an attractive financial profile and high growth will drive Bill.com\u2019s own growth.\n\nDivvy seems to be a suitable acquisition target that will strengthen Bill.com strategically and financially. The company will be able to provide a more wholistic offering to its customers and capture a larger share of their wallet. As the company expands its market, competition will increase from incumbents like Brex, Ramp, Airbase, Coupa, Expensify and Spendesk.\n\n    Financials \n\nIn the [last available quarter](https://s24.q4cdn.com/404137088/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/BILL-IR-DECK-Q3'21-Final.pdf) (ending March 2021),\n\n* total revenue was $60 million, up 45% YoY,\n* gross margin was 74%, vs 76% in the same quarter previous year (PY),\n* free cash flow was ($6.2) million, vs ($2.1) million PY,\n* implying a FCF margin of (10%), vs (5%) PY,\n* its rule of 40 value was 34%,\n* its dollar based net retention rate was 121%, and\n* its CAC payback period was 10 months\n\nLet\u2019s compare that with the average cloud software company in the SaaS index:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1iv78tlopc971.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b155a4b9a6381fbe86275c0dde55594d8d25c9ee\n\n* **Growth:** Bill.com is growing quite a bit faster than the average. This is important because growth is what investors pay the highest price for\n* **Gross margin:** Pretty much on par with the market\n* **FCF margin:** The free cash flow is notably lower than that of most other SaaS companies, as Bill.com is still burning cash to drive growth\n* **Rule of 40:** As a result of the negative profitability, its rule of 40 value is below average. Nevertheless, 34% is a decent value\n* **Net retention:** With 121%, the company is a little above average and shows a healthy ability of retaining and growing existing customers\n* **CAC Payback period:** The relatively low value of 10 months is good for the company and is likely a bi-product from the market moving from manual to digital, which means that the company is winning customers even without massively increasing sales and marketing spending\n* **Cash:** As of March 2021, Bill.com has almost $800 million in net cash on the balance sheet. $625 million of that will be used to pay for the acquisition of Divvy, leaving $175 million in net cash\n\n**In summary,** financials are very good driven by a strong tailwind from the market bringing customers to its doorstep. At the moment, the company seems to focus on keeping growth as high as possible at the expense of profitability. This is the smart thing to do in order to capture market share in a time when every SMB is looking for an automated bookkeeping solution. With $175 million in available net cash and a quarterly cash burn of $6.2 million, Bill.com has sufficient runway left. Nevertheless, the company will soon need to show investors the ability to turn profitable while maintaining a high growth rate.\n\n    Valuation \n\nAs of Friday\u2019s close, Bill.com has a total enterprise value of **$16.4 billion**. Based on estimated NTM revenues of $279 million (including the quarter that ended this week), this represents an astronomic TEV / NTM revenue multiple of **59x.**\n\nThe charts below show an index of cloud software companies, mapping their performance metrics (e.g. growth) against their valuation (TEV/NTM revenue multiple).

Nevertheless, Bill.com\u2019s valuation is too high. Companies with similar profiles are trading at **20x - 25x NTM revenue**. This means that Bill.com has a more than **100% premium valuation** to the market standard. Is this justified by a superior product offering, exclusive partnership agreements or a brand name?

        "selftext": "You will see the full analysis is below, but its a bit of a read, so here\u2019s the exec sum:\n\n* **Product:** Bill.com is a fintech platform that helps small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) streamline and automate billing and payment processes that most SMBs still perform manually.\n* **Revenue model:** 49% fixed-fee recurring, 49% usage-based \u201crecurring in nature\u201d, 2% float interest.\n* **Market size:** $9 billion domestically, $30 billion globally. Strong pandemic-driven momentum.\n* **Go-to-market:** Direct and indirect via channel partners (most major accounting firms, accounting software providers and financial institutions).\n* **Competition:** Several competing solutions available, new challenger start-ups and competitors entering from adjacent market segments.\n* **M&amp;A:** Bill.com is in the process of acquiring spend management company Divvy for $2.5 billion ($625 million in cash, rest in shares). Divvy has $100 million in annual revenue, growing 100% YoY.\n* **Financials:** Strong financial performance based on high revenue growth, good customer retention and on-target operating efficiency. Company will need to prove ability to maintain growth while turning profitable.\n* **Valuation:** The total enterprise value (TEV) of $16.4 billion implies a TEV / NTM revenue multiple of 59x. Comparable companies are valued at 20x - 25x.\n* **Conclusion:** High-quality company with an excessive price tag. Share price likely to decline to market standard levels. Target PPS: $100 (-54%), in 6 - 12 months\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    Product\n\nInvoicing and payment processes can be messy and physical documents are prone to human error, which can lead to incorrect or delayed payments. This is where Bill.com comes into the picture. Its platform automatically fills out invoices or recognizes information on incoming invoices, including supplier details and payment amounts, reducing the time for data entry and the likelihood of manual errors. \n\nThe platform offers automated field entries, bill approval and payment. Then, it is synced with the accounting software such as QuickBooks for reconciliation of accounting entries and bookkeeping. The integration between Bill.com and the accounting software eliminates double entry and human errors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7la5vq1ko6971.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a6241f9450e679671a41a208182baf8f09db382\n\nIts payment tools enable remote approval and automated payments to suppliers via ACH, wire transfers or PayPal. The company\u2019s bill payment feature enables customers to make electronic payments to suppliers outside the US and, compared to banks, the company\u2019s transaction fees are more competitive. For example, banks usually charge an average of $38 as wire transfers fee whereas Bill.com charges almost 4 times less with its International Payments solution, providing costs savings to its customers. According to the company, it offers payments options to over 130 countries with a supplier network of over 2.5 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ww7n98mo6971.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f2207c351aaf4bda3538bce5e102494b2f12e9e\n\n    Revenue Model\n\nThe company earns revenues through **subscription** and **transaction fees** as well as **interest** on transactions held. \n\nIn the last quarter, which ended in March 2021, 49% of total revenues were recurring based on per user pricing for use of the platform as a fixed monthly or annual payment. Another 49% was transaction revenue, which represents usage-based fees collected for each transaction processed through the platform. The remaining 2% are float revenue, which is interest earned from customer funds while payment transactions are clearing.\n\nWhile 49% recurring revenue is very low compared to other SaaS businesses, it is fair to say that the other 49% transaction revenue are for the most part \u201crecurring in nature\u201d: A customer who only has access to the platform but does not have any transactions (let\u2019s say a payment of accounts payables), will not pay transaction fees. But customers have a certain number of transactions each month for which they will pay. The number of these may fluctuate to some degree, but for the most part, they can be seen as recurring.\n\n    Market Size\n\nIn 2018, there were approximately 30 million SMBs in the US. While 24 million of these SMBs are sole-proprietors, the company focuses on serving the over 6 million employer firms, because SMBs large enough to have employees tend to have a greater need for more advanced accounts payable and accounts receivable processes in their back offices.\n\nBy multiplying the average revenue per customer of $1,500 by the 6 million domestic employer firms and 20 million (sufficiently large) SMBs globally, the total annual addressable market for the company can be estimated at **$9 billion domestically** and **$30 billion worldwide**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dak02nipo6971.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb908e47cb36807e70d4abf6e4bde08574c17847\n\n    Go-To-Market\n\nBill.com acquires customers **directly** through digital marketing and inside sales, and **indirectly** through accounting firms and strategic partners including accounting software companies and financial institutions.\n\nIts partner base includes over 80 of the top 100 accounting firms in the US and several of the largest financial institutions, including **Bank of America, JPMorgan and American Express**. Bill.com\u2019s platform can be integrated with many of the major accounting software providers including companies such as **QuickBooks Online, Xero, Sage Intacct and Oracle NetSuite**, who dominate the accounting software market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mngq1kro6971.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ec0c3351e1711f983e90a735c6b2dcedd8cbdc8\n\nBill.com\u2019s integration with major accounting software and partnerships with financial institutions provides the company with an avenue to expand its market reach. However, the accounting software vendors could quickly turn from partners into  competitors if they decide to provide similar services. Also, there is nothing stopping the partnered banks from collaborating with competitors in the future. On the contrary, it would be in the bank\u2019s and accounting firms\u2019 interests to work with several providers besides Bill.com.\n\n**To summarize,** the company\u2019s partnerships and integrations are valuable assets in its go-to-market approach. However, they are not a competitive moat.\n\n    Competition\n\nA range of other companies are offering good competing solutions. Differentiation can come from the breadth of the product offering or integrations with complementary systems like accounting, banking or ERP software.\n\nWith a user friendly and mature product, the company was well positioned to benefit from the move to digital that accelerated in 2020 and H1-2021 due to the pandemic. But while the company has an early-mover network advantage with various leading financial accounting software providers, financial institutions and accounting firms, competitive pressures are certain to increase in the future as various challenger companies are emerging and players from adjacent markets enter the competition to get a piece of the cake.\n\nFor example, payables automation solution provider **Tipalti**, who is valued at $2 billion. The company has stronger focus on enterprise customers and already counts player like Twitter, Twitch, Roblox, Roku, National Geographic, Business Insider and many other names to its customer base.\n\nAdditionally, cloud-based business spending management platform **Coupa** (COUP) has a TEV of $20 billion and is expected to generate ca. $540 million in revenue this year. Coupa provides companies control and visibility into how they spend money but also offers invoice automation and billing services similar to Bill.com\u2019s.\n\n    Divvy M&amp;A\n\nIn early June, Bill.com announced that it is going to acquired Divvy, a corporate spend management \u201cstartup\u201d. The total purchase price of around $2.5 billion is substantially above the company\u2019s roughly $1.6 billion post-money valuation that Divvy set in its January 2021 financing round. $625 million will be paid in cash, the remainder in shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plhkwgmvo6971.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b98691049600f9944ca9cdfe880b58363ffa919d\n\n**Divvy by the numbers:**\n\n* $100 million annualized revenue\n* \\&gt;100% revenue growth YoY\n* $4 billion annualized total payment volume (TPV)\n\nSo Divvy sold for around 25x its current revenue-run-rate and the growth rate tells us that the company did not sell due to performance weakness.\n\n**Strategic rationale for the acquisition**: Bill.com extends its platform with Divvy\u2019s complementary spend management capabilities and therefore expands its overall market opportunity by serving a larger share of the customer\u2019s spend. Additionally, buying a company with an attractive financial profile and high growth will drive Bill.com\u2019s own growth.\n\nDivvy seems to be a suitable acquisition target that will strengthen Bill.com strategically and financially. The company will be able to provide a more wholistic offering to its customers and capture a larger share of their wallet. As the company expands its market, competition will increase from incumbents like Brex, Ramp, Airbase, Coupa, Expensify and Spendesk. \n\n    Financials\n\nIn the [last available quarter](https://s24.q4cdn.com/404137088/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/BILL-IR-DECK-Q3'21-Final.pdf) (ending March 2021), \n\n* total revenue was $60 million, up 45% YoY,\n* gross margin was 74%, vs 76% in the same quarter previous year (PY),\n* free cash flow was ($6.2) million, vs ($2.1) million PY,\n* implying a FCF margin of (10%), vs (5%) PY,\n* its rule of 40 value was 34%,\n* its dollar based net retention rate was 121%, and\n* its CAC payback period was 10 months\n\nLet\u2019s compare that with the average cloud software company in the SaaS index:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fnqk1b4zo6971.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3749022f6924fa4d21c14ffeb3952ebd59b47772\n\n* **Growth:** Bill.com is growing quite a bit faster than the average. This is important because growth is what investors pay the highest price for\n* **Gross margin:** Pretty much on par with the market\n* **FCF margin:** The free cash flow is notably lower than that of most other SaaS companies, as Bill.com is still burning cash to drive growth\n* **Rule of 40:** As a result of the negative profitability, its rule of 40 value is below average. Nevertheless, 34% is a decent value\n* **Net retention:** With 121%, the company is a little above average and shows a healthy ability of retaining and growing existing customers\n* **CAC Payback period:** The relatively low value of 10 months is good for the company and is likely a bi-product from the market moving from manual to digital, which means that the company is winning customers even without massively increasing sales and marketing spending\n* **Cash:** As of March 2021, Bill.com has almost $800 million in net cash on the balance sheet. $625 million of that will be used to pay for the acquisition of Divvy, leaving $175 million in net cash\n\n**In summary,** financials are very good driven by a strong tailwind from the market bringing customers to its doorstep. At the moment, the company seems to focus on keeping growth as high as possible at the expense of profitability. This is the smart thing to do in order to capture market share in a time when every SMB is looking for an automated bookkeeping solution. With $175 million in available net cash and a quarterly cash burn of $6.2 million, Bill.com has sufficient runway left. Nevertheless, the company will soon need to show investors the ability to turn profitable while maintaining a high growth rate.\n\n    Valuation\n\nAs of Friday\u2019s close, Bill.com has a total enterprise value of **$16.4 billion**. Based on estimated NTM revenues of $279 million (including the quarter that ended this week), this represents an astronomic TEV / NTM revenue multiple of **59x.**\n\nThe charts below show an index of cloud software companies, mapping their performance metrics (e.g. growth) against their valuation (TEV/NTM revenue multiple).

But it's not the end for Microsoft's connected defense ambitions.\n\nThe initiative was expected to drag the DoD\u2019s computing platforms into the 21st century by consolidating them into a single entity. The idea was to ensure everyone from DoD employees in the U.S. to soldiers on the frontline could access and manipulate data and support innovations in artificial intelligence at the speed of modern enterprises.\n\nMicrosoft initially won the contract in 2019, giving its cloud platform, the second largest in the world, a massive win over market leader Amazon. But the deal was fraught with issues including accusations of interference by then-President Donald Trump \u2014 who expresses disdain for Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN?p=AMZN&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and worries about a single company controlling the government\u2019s entire cloud platform.\n\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Microsoft, though. The company now has the option to bid on JEDI\u2019s replacement, the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability initiative, a multi-cloud project that could see Microsoft and Amazon win the contract together.\n\n**A potential win for both Microsoft and Amazon**\n\nIn a statement announcing the end of JEDI, the DoD more or less lays out that Microsoft and Amazon are still its top contenders for the JWCC contract.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC) will be a multi-cloud/multi-vendor Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cThe Department intends to seek proposals from a limited number of sources, namely the Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) and Amazon Web Services (AWS), as available market research indicates that these two vendors are the only Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) capable of meeting the Department\u2019s requirements.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the initiative\u2019s contract is listed for an indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity means that it could stretch beyond the $10 billion of JEDI, which would benefit the two tech giants.\n\nSo while Microsoft would certainly like to know it\u2019s got a $10 billion contract with the DoD under its belt, the knowledge that it\u2019s almost guaranteed to at least share the JWCC contract with Amazon should offer some relief.\n\n**Project JEDI has been controversial for years**\n\nProject JEDI was plagued with controversy since it was announced in 2018 \u2014 with cybersecurity experts like NYU Tandon School of Engineering professor Justin Cappos pointing to the dangers of the DoD relying on a single cloud vendor, a relative rarity even in the enterprise space.\n\nThe reason using a single vendor is so controversial? It\u2019s simply safer to use multiple cloud vendors. Think of it this way: If a single cloud vendor is hit with a cyberattack and can\u2019t provide the services the DoD needs, the Pentagon is out of luck. But its operations can continue if it can rely on a backup provider.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft\u2019s then general manager of national security Leigh Madden said as much during a [2018 interview with TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/23/dod-clarifies-winner-take-all-cloud-contract/), telling the publication, \u201cit\u2019s counter to what we are seeing across the globe where 80% of customers are adopting a multi-cloud solution.\u201d\n\n**Microsoft didn\u2019t even start work on the project**\n\nThe DoD released its final request for proposal (RFP) for JEDI in July 2018, after receiving 1,500 comments and questions on previous RFPs.\n\nWhile Amazon was considered a shoo-in for the project because of its massive cloud business, it was not Microsoft\u2019s only competition. Oracle ([ORCL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ORCL?p=ORCL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) and IBM ([IBM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBM?p=IBM&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), which are also players in the cloud market, were among a number of firms vying for JEDI's $10 billion contract.\n\nIn the end, though, Amazon and Microsoft, which have a slew of data centers stationed throughout the world, and a history of working with the [government, came in as the two finalists](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/technology/amazon-microsoft-jedi-pentagon.html), the Pentagon said in April.\n\nWhen Microsoft won the contract in 2019, Amazon filed suit alleging the Trump administration interfered with the award process. The thinking from Amazon was that Trump had a bone to pick with then-Amazon CEO Bezos, who owns the Washington Post \u2014 a paper that had scrutinized the Trump administration.\n\nAn investigation by the [DoD\u2019s Inspector General](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Apr/15/2002281438/-1/-1/1/REPORT%20ON%20THE%20JOINT%20ENTERPRISE%20DEFENSE%20INFRASTRUCTURE%20(JEDI)%20CLOUD%20PROCUREMENT%20DODIG-2020-079.PDF), however, found the Trump administration had not interfered with the process. Still, Amazon sought to fight the award to Microsoft, and won a restraining order blocking the Windows maker from beginning work on the project.\n\nAmazon\u2019s legal fight picked up steam in April when [Amazon beat out a motion to dismiss its case](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409245/amazon-microsoft-jedi-contract-reject-motion-dismiss-trump-influence). That left the JEDI\u2019s existence up in the air, raising questions about whether the DoD would continue to slog through court fight after court fight to maintain the project.\n\n\"We understand and agree with the DoD\u2019s decision,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the contract award was not based on the merits of the proposals and instead was the result of outside influence that has no place in government procurement.\"",

        "selftext": "SAN FRANCISCO,\u00a0March 17, 2021 --\u00a0Coalition, the leading cyber insurance and security company, today announced it has raised\u00a0$175 million\u00a0to accelerate its rapid growth and global expansion. Index Ventures led the funding with participation from General Atlantic and the company's existing investors, valuing Coalition at\u00a0$1.75 billion.\n\nCoalition has raised\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in equity funding from leading global technology investors, including Index Ventures, General Atlantic, Ribbit Capital, Vy Capital, Hillhouse Capital, and Valor Equity Partners, among others. Founded in 2017 by\u00a0Joshua Motta\u00a0and\u00a0John Hering, Coalition is one of the largest cyber insurance and security providers in\u00a0the United States\u00a0and\u00a0Canada. Today, Coalition serves over 42,000 customers, providing no-cost cybersecurity tools to prevent losses, security and incident response services to contain them, and comprehensive insurance to help organizations recover from failures and breaches. The investment follows long-term capacity commitments from leading global insurers\u00a0Swiss Re\u00a0and\u00a0Arch Insurance.\n\n**Company profile**\n\n**The basic information**\n\nDate of establishment: March 2017 \n\nLocation: Headquartered in San Francisco, the company has offices in New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.\n\n**The company size**\n\nValuation: The Series C round valued the company at $890 million\n\nNumber of customers: More than 25,000 customers when the Series C financing was completed\n\nRevenue: Estimated 2019 revenue of $27 million\n\n**Founded background**\n\nCoalition, an online insurance company co-founded by Joshua Motta and John Hering, two cyber-security experts.\u00a0They also hired Catherine Lyle, head of network claims at Swiss Re, and Shawn Ram, head of Crystal's technology and network business. Coalition combines comprehensive insurance and cyber security tools to help enterprises manage and mitigate cyber risks.\n\nAccording to Joshua Motta, we live in an age where the Internet has changed everything. Problems caused by technical glitches or cyber attacks include disinformation, election rigging, hospital closures and even widespread power outages. And when that happens, how we protect ourselves becomes a problem.\n\nIn fact, while enjoying the convenience brought by technological development, major insurance enterprises are also faced with a variety of network risks such as data leakage and ransomware attacks. Oracle spokesperson Deborah Hellinger has confirmed that BlueKai, the technology giant's data management platform, has leaked the records of billions of people around the world because its servers were not encrypted. In addition, Facebook, Yahoo and other giants in various fields have been suffered a huge blow due to the data leak, and they were\u00a0faced with\u00a0class action lawsuits and huge fines. According to a 2019 study by IBM on the costs of data breaches, the average cost to victims of a data breach is $3.92 million. Therefore, for the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises, data leakage and other network security problems will be devastating.\n\nThe emergence and development of this risk have made the insurance industry see the importance of network security insurance. Motta, one of the founders of Coalition, pointed out that working in Coalition can provide a guarantee for those enterprises that are not large in scale and cannot afford comprehensive security technology.\n\n**Finance course**\n\nCoalition raised $10 million in Series A round in 2018, Its investors include VY Capital, Ribbit Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, and Deep Nishar,\u00a0senior managing director of the SoftBank Vision Fund.\n\nIn 2019, Coalition closed a $40 million Series B funding round. The round was led by Ribbit Capital, with Greenoaks Capital and Hillhouse Capital also participating.\n\nIn May\u00a02020, Coalition raised $90 million in Series C funding round led by Valor Equity Partners, along with Felicis Ventures, Greyhound Capital, and existing investors including\u00a0Vy Capital, Ribbit Capital, Hillhouse Capital and Greenoaks Capital. \n\nOn March 17, 2021, [Coalition](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3099544-1&amp;h=4237564897&amp;u=https://www.coalitioninc.com/&amp;a=Coalition) announced it has raised\u00a0$175 million\u00a0to accelerate its rapid growth and global expansion. Index Ventures led the funding with participation from General Atlantic and the company's existing investors, valuing Coalition at\u00a0$1.75 billion.\n\n**Business model**\n\nAs for the mission of Coalition, Motta defines it as solving cyber risks. To achieve this goal, Coalition combines free cybersecurity tools and services to enable businesses to manage and mitigate cyber risk.\n\n**Product: comprehensive and fast**\n\nCompared with the traditional network security insurance, Coalition lays more emphasis on the protection of network security for enterprises. Joshua Motta mentioned that network security is not a technical problem, but a risk management problem. Traditional network security technologies, such as firewalls, protect the network rather than the enterprise. So instead of providing any hardware or software, Coalition protects the entire enterprise by offering cybersecurity and incident response services and comprehensive insurance up to $15 million.\n\nThe word \"comprehensive\" can be fully reflected in the first network insurance product launched by Coalition. The product will compensate companies for direct financial losses caused by fraud in the use of business services, including SaaS, IaaS, NAAS, and telephone services. It avoids the three risks of unauthorized access and fraudulent use of an organization's business services, long-distance telephone fraud, and encryption and password hijacking.\n\nAs for adding new content to an already comprehensive insurance offering, Joshua Motta says, \"Cyber attacks are no longer just about data breaches and the theft of large amounts of data. They have expanded to the theft of an organization's IT services and infrastructure for criminal proceeds and password theft. The resulting costs may be there for an organization, but they are not included in most insurance policies today.\"\n\nFor enterprises, in addition to getting protection for the specific risks they are facing,\u00a0the whole process of getting insurance is more concise. Coalition mainly sells products through insurance brokers. Through the online platform of Coalition, after brokers input the basic information of customers, they can get the quotes and policies generated for the company within a few minutes. In this process, Coalition used public information to access a large number of data, so as to understand the risks of the company and accurately price it. It is worth noting that Coalition can not only collect a large amount of data related to risks, but also make underwriting decisions in a very short period of time through these data, which greatly simplifies the whole insurance purchasing process and achieves accuracy on the basis of speed.\n\n**Services: supply\u00a0of risk management applications**\n\nFor policyholders, Coalition provides them with a proprietary network security application aimed at detecting, managing and mitigating threats, including automatic security alerts, threat alerts, expert guidance and other services, which can help enterprises when they face cyber attacks without paying extra fees. In the face of the heterogeneity of network risks, Coalition continues to add more functions and applications to help enterprises manage risks in various forms.\n\nIn the claim link, Coalition has improved the speed of processing and resolving claims through a large number of technologies. Coalition's Incident Response Experts are available to assist users when they call Coalition due to a cyber attack. Coalition, together with its partner companies (including public relations, legal and crisis management experts), stands ready to help businesses recover from a cyber security incident.\n\nWith comprehensive products and perfect service, and currently with the support of\u00a0Swiss Re, Lloyd's of London and Argo group, Coalition provides up to 15 million U.S. dollars in network and technology insurance for companies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and 20 million Canadian dollars in insurance for companies in all 10 Canadian provinces. Its clients include technology companies, investment companies, retail merchants, banks, and manufacturers, etc.\n\n**The future development**\n\n\"The future of cybersecurity and insurance is an integrated solution for cyber events across all asset types,\" said Shawn Ram, director of Coalition's insurance practice, in response to Coalition's announcement last\u00a0year that it was expanding its services to companies in Canada. \u201cWe are excited to make this future a reality in the Canadian market.\"\n\nThe expansion of the business also helps Coalition to have a better understanding of network security, and Coalition has not stopped innovating in products. Also last\u00a0year, Coalition announced the acquisition of BinaryEdge, a Swiss-based Internet scanning and cybersecurity company. BinaryEdge has an Internet data collection platform that enables continuous scanning of the global Internet, mapping and providing real-time threat intelligence to more than 5 billion devices of more than 15 million commercial entities.\n\nWith this acquisition, Coalition could\u00a0integrate BinaryEdge's technology with its network insurance and security platform so that policyholders can map their Internet attack surfaces for real-time monitoring and proactive fixes to vulnerabilities.\n\nIn fact, the field of network security keeps changing,\u00a0and\u00a0the development of science and technology gives criminals a chance. Data leakage and other hazards to network security continue to exist, and may occur at any time. Behind this widespread phenomenon, companies will increasingly recognize that having a cybersecurity insurance policy is a protection against potentially catastrophic losses. According to the WEF white paper, the cyber security market, including cyber security insurance, was\u00a0expected to reach $170\u00a0billion\u00a0by 2020 and maintain an annual growth rate of at least 10-15 per cent.\n\nTherefore, network security insurance has become a big opportunity for insurance companies. In this field, Anda Insurance, Zurich Insurance and other foreign insurance companies have been operating\u00a0business for a long time. In China,\u00a0PICC property insurance, Ping An property insurance and other companies have also successively launched corresponding products. The comprehensive product guarantee, rapid response to claims and additional risk detection tools are undoubtedly the trump card for Coalition to surpass many rivals.",
