        "selftext": "Now listen up, this isn't going to be the best DD you've ever seen. I'm busy.\n\nThis company used to be called Uragold Bay Resources but changed its named to HPQ Silicon Resources, after spinning out its gold division.\n\nHere's an excerpt from their website:  \n\n\n&gt;HPQ Silicon Resources INC. is a TSX-V listed (Symbol HPQ) resource company that focuses on becoming a producer of nano silicon materials, and nanowires for use in silicon metal applications in diverse global market sectors.\n\nHPQ is working with Pyrogenesis on a game changing technology. Who's Pyrogenesis? They're an advanced plasma company that has contracts with the US military and many more companies.\n\nNow over a decade ago, there was a company named Timminco who claimed to be able to do what HPQ is seeking out to do.\n\nCheck out this stock's history:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TIMNF/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TIMNF/)\n\nIt went from a penny stock all the way to $30. \n\nThe issue this company had is that they could not scale on an industrial scale.  \n\n\n&gt;This was the place where Timminco Ltd., until recently a little-known producer of low-grade industrial metals, said it had solved the solar industry's supply problem. Here, in B\u00e9cancour, it had developed a proprietary process to produce solar-grade silicon much more cheaply than anyone else. That promise had propelled Timminco shares from less than 30 cents to more than $22 by the end of 2007, earning it plaudits as the top-performing stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange that year. The company's market value would soon surpass $3.5-billion. \n\nTimminco's chart alone made me invest into this company initially because it'd be incredible to be on such a ride.\n\nThe solar and battery industries are continually growing, and HPQ, like Timminco, are saying that they are able to produce solar-grade silicon at a much cheaper cost than current methods.\n\nOn a small scale, HPQ has shown that they are able to produce 2N to 4N silicon from low quality quartz metal which is incredible and will change the game forever... IF they are able to do it on an industrial scale.\n\nThere were many delays but the pilot plant is built. We have yet to hear their latest findings.\n\nIn the mean time, they have 2 NDA's signed with other companies in regards to their product. Many are hoping its Tesla. Could be, but it's not necessary for HPQ's success. Being able to convert low quality quartz into 4N silicon on a large scale will change the solar industry forever, making it much more affordable.\n\nTo finish things off, they have a partnership with a French solar company Apollon. Their latest NR suggests they will also be working on another industry:  \n\n\n&gt;HPQ and Apollon Solar Extend Agreement to Work on Porous Silicon for Batteries and Expand Collaboration to Include Hydrogen Production  \n&gt;  \n&gt; *The addition of manufacturing hydrogen by hydrolysis to our collaboration opens up a new and unique business opportunity that could represent a* [***second multibillion-dollar*** ***addressable market***](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=x7BsefzKh0RM5mLy50SQnfkrPrlAeJux1o3-uQWKZ3_dYuE0j_jnnjcsmUqeiwYn7xTHUf8PFoVtPfr72B95_DxDcpv8V8YCwlaVpphdgHSFXastUVEHmNn_-GfSPUzkAiuXx-mRLGmbnSu0ZjW3hw==)*for the PUREVAPTM\u00a0Nano Silicon (Si) Reactor (\u201cNSiR\u201d) nanopowders.\u201d* \n\nThis isn't going to be the most organized DD because I've got shit to do. I've been holding stock in this company for years now. I'm already in the positive but I figured I'd add something to this subreddit as I keep seeing the same tickers and this one is very different.\n\nIf you want me to post another pennystock that I'm in, please let me know.",

        "selftext": "So a few days ago, I posted shitty DD on a company named HPQ which aims to produce cheaper batteries through its process called PUREVAP in collaboration with PyroGenesis.\n\nSo how are they better than the standard way of making lithium batteries currently? Here's a photo:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t5xy9hg9fwo51.png?width=1613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d640fd577b38a96074652617d2896a4d922a082d\n\nThey've shown on a small scale that they can do this, and they started building their pilot plant in December 2019 I think.\n\nIn addition to their partnerships with PyroGenesis and Apollon (in France), they apparently have 2 NDAs that they cannot mention.\n\nTheir CEO had mentioned that they cannot name the company.\n\nYesterday, if you watched Battery Day, Elon said that silicon is the future of making cheaper batteries. He alluded to a technology just like PUREVAP.\n\nAlso last night, the CEO of PyroGenesis made a comment during an AGM presentation, \"hey isn't it battery day for someone?\".\n\nIf $HPQ.V $URAGF is partnered with Tesla, then damn, this stock is poisted to fucking skyrocket.\n\nIf you look a Timminco's chart, a company who claimed to be able to do what HPQ is doing, before they went bust, you can see the potential:\n\n[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/TIMNF?p=TIMNF&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/TIMNF?p=TIMNF&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)\n\nAt the same time, there's a lot of risk. But even without the partnership, being able to turn 98% silicon into 2N - 4N means a lot of money for HPQ in all industries.\n\nIn addition, the Government of Quebec, where HPQ is stationed, announced a 1.4B plan for battery manufacturing.\n\nHigh risk. High rewards. Good luck.",
