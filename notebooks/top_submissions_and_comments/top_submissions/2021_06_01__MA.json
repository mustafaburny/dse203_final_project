        "selftext": "I'm back fellow retards, back with a juicy new play that should satisfy your summer shart desires.\n\n**From the degenerate behind** [**The $WOOF of Wall Street**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzq2ke/the_woof_of_wall_street_a_shart_play_dd/) and [**$TX - Latin America's Balls of Steel**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx74mo/tx_dd_ternium_it_up_latin_americas_balls_of_steel/)**, I introduce to you $LESL -  A S.H.A.R.T DD.**\n\n# The Poolpercycle:\n\nTo give context behind why I decided to look into Leslies Swimming Pool Supplies, I will first educate you retards on the ongoing Poolpercyle (pool supercycle). Housing prices are at all time highs, lumber prices skyrocketed, and every commodity is rising in price faster than your dicks on Viagra. JPOW continues to suppress inflation as the money printer goes brrrr, with my suspicions being that him and Yellen are making love to the sounds of the money printer going brrrrrr (jk).\n\n**Chlorine** is a prime commodity that has undergone severe shortages recently and **Leslie Swimming Pool Supplies** is about to take full advantage of every penny faster than Krabs can say \u201cmoney money money\u201d. As reopening continues in the United States, many Americans are still at home and in a rush to build pools in their backyards to avoid the local summer crowds. New homeowners who had to deal with inflated housing prices are seeking to get pools built on their own, rather than purchasing a house that already has one. Past the one-time expense of getting a pool built, most companies such as Leslie capitalize on the everlasting **maintenance and servicing** needed to ensure your kid\u2019s pool piss is cleaned in time. Currently, there are approximately 5.2 million residential inground pools and 255,000 commercial pools across the United States. Of these, approximately 65% necessitate the use of **chlorine tablets**. These tablets are used in the filtration and sterilization process to ensure each pool is void of disease and bodily fluids that your 5 year old cousin dumps into the ecosystem.\n\nWithin 2020 and through 2021, **there are an estimated additional 200,000 new residential pools being installed.** Additionally, the sale of permits required to operate certain pools has risen by 32%, nearly **85% more than the previous year.**\n\nCoincidentally, and to the advantage of this DD, the Bio-Lab factory, which produces pool and spa treatment products, experienced a devastating fire last summer after Hurricane Laura. **To this date, the nation is experiencing a chlorine shortage as a result of this fire.**\n\nAs given by chlorine analysts, *\u201cIHS Markit predicts chlorine prices could jump 70% this following summer, after already doubling in some areas in the months following the fire at BioLab. The real effects of that fire haven\u2019t been felt, as it took place right before Labor Day, when many pools close for the end of summer.\u201d* What this shows me is that there is still a large upside and that the worst of the shortage\u2019s impact on pool prices is yet to come.\n\n**My research has led to one conclusion. What we are seeing is an unprecedented intersection between rising commodity prices, shortages, and high pent up demand for summer pool builds. The time has never been more perfect to invest in companies dealing with the Pool Boom aka Poolpercycle.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# So who is Leslie and why the fuck is she selling pool supplies?\n\nLeslie\u2019s Swimming Pool Supplies is the largest direct-to-consumer brand in the U.S. pool and spa industry. Operating since 1963, at the dawn of the age of suburban pools, Leslie has nearly 940 physical locations and an expansive e-commerce platform that rivals most local brands. They specialize in residential pools and spas, as well as commercial pools and even custom builds. The company sells maintenance items, such as chemicals, equipment and parts, and cleaning and maintenance equipment, as well as safety, recreational, and fitness-related products. Their diverse array of expertise caters to clients of all needs and wants, proving their business model to be quite adaptive. 80% of their sales are non-discretionary, which in autist terms means necessary/essential purchases. **By solidifying a model that is almost completely based on necessary purchases, Leslie stands to profit from the Pool Boom for years to come. Finally you can profit off of the Chad poolboy banging your wife.**\n\nLeslie's also benefits year round as pools need to be maintained (even in the winter). Failure to do so results in imminent degradation of the pool\u2019s foundation and ultimately risks collapse or inground flooding. Additionally, without maintaining a clean filtration and treatment system, the overall pool system could be damaged and need further replacement, incurring unnecessary costs. As a result, most residential and commercial customers prefer to buy those sweet, sweet essential chlorine products from Leslie's.\n\n[Cock and Ball torture sponsored by Leslie Chlorine Pellets](https://preview.redd.it/ny2izwzcdn571.png?width=170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebc2c67167d991f52cd9de0a2523b32377985cfe)\n\n# Piss In The Pool:\n\n[\\\\\"Look Ma. I'm Peeing\\\\\" - proceeds to shart-](https://preview.redd.it/0updw12gdn571.png?width=1322&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe65c57695f9be974d73134c8b5ec33fee123c43)\n\nSo how does a company selling overpriced chlorine pellets stand to profit?\n\n2 simple reasons:\n\n* **When little James sharts himself in the pool, you\u2019re not cleaning that up yourself.**\n* **Leslie is vertically integrated and produces its own chlorine pellets.**\n\nBy being its own manufacturer and reseller, Leslie incurs no additional costs that other pool companies have to pay when buying these pellets wholesale. As of now **45%** **of profits** come  directly from the pellet sales. Their main competitors such as Holiday Pools have been severely impacted by the Louisiana chemical plant fire, and face in-store shortages. **Leslie does face chlorine pellet and product shortages as well, which I highlight in the**  **\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b**  **Case, but I believe that by producing their own products, a shortage at Leslie means a shortage at every other pool store.** There would simply be no other place to shop from save for paying high premiums on overseas products.\n\nLeslie's futher offsets costs to its customers with a \u201cfuck you pay me\u201d approach, similar to what $TX has done with steel. Buying stocks that directly deal with chlorine distribution can be more risky if commodity prices suddenly fall or shortages are resolved. **$LESL gives zero fucks as it will profit regardless while one thing remains constant: demand.**\n\n# With Love &amp; Loyalty, From Leslie:\n\nLeslie may be increasing costs on the consumer end but it recognizes the pool demand boom and continues to expand rewards and education programs to help its customers make better purchases and improve their pools\u2019 quality. **Leslie\u2019s Pool Perks** is a new loyalty program that boosts its e-commerce presence by offering **free shipping on all orders, 5% rewards points on every purchase**, and special discounts through its app including many extended warranties.\n\nWith inground pools costing $35,000 and above ground pools near a cost of $3,000, rewards points alone would range from $150 to $2000, all of which would cover future chlorine pellet necessities.\n\nLeslie has also started a joint educational program this summer with the YMCA  to teach safe pool maintenance and usage practices, as well as the risks associated with inground pool play ;).  That\u2019ll teach your wife to not fuck her boyfriend in the water.\n\n**Based on this information, I believe that the investments Leslie is continuously making in its customer base show it is dedicated to provide a quality experience while racking up profits in the process.**\n\n# The H.A.R.T Play:\n\n* **Hype:**\n\n$LESL has been mentioned here before, if minimally. There was also a Pool Gang in the past who got shit on due to bad market timing and suppressed price movement. I will discuss this soon. IV is moderately high ranging from 50% to 80% as of writing this which tells me this is still a good options play if you believe that Leslie is a good buy.\n\n* **Availability:**\n\nAs mentioned in past DDs, when I say availability, it is meant to measure the demand of the goods and services provided by said company. Leslie\u2019s products have extreme demand and not enough supply. In the short term this may seem detrimental as customers won\u2019t always get enough supplies, but in the long-run this is extremely profitable. Plus, who else are they going to buy from? Raj from Pool Support?\n\n* **Really Memeable:**\n\n$LESL is quite memable for 2 reasons:\n\n1. For fucks sake, Leslie sounds like Becky\u2019s side bitch who takes two shots and falls asleep.\n2. $LESL and pools can coin the phrase \u201cDrown the Shorts\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Timing:**\n\nThis may be the best entry point in a long time. With the FOMC meeting today and JPOW shenanigans, $LESL may dip further, bringing its price point down to levels not seen **since December**. Additionally, $LESL put/call ratio continues to grow, giving a golden opportunity to catch price action off guard.\n\n# Financials:\n\n[\u201cMy bathtub the size of swimming pools\u201d \\~ Future ](https://preview.redd.it/ymle9yuldn571.png?width=344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8040f02d502b3fb86a256281b1c4c3fbc1e4a225)\n\n$LESL is smart and went public this past fall, right when chlorine shortages started to impact supply across the nation. **Over the past 57 years, they have had consecutive sales growth at 7.1% CAGR since 2001.**\n\nFor Q1 of 2021, Leslies was expected to have a -$0.1 EPS, but ended with a -$0.02 EPS, indicating a **80% beat.** For Q2 of 2021, the expected EPS is **$0.53, or nearly a 2600% increase over one quarter.** Additionally, just yesterday, Leslie released forward guidance indicating an expected EPS of **$0.75** **which would indicate 3750% EPS growth.**\n\nLeslie\u2019s physical footprint through retail now exceeds **all 20 of its competitors combined**. This is essential to sustained growth because when looking at P/E growth as well, it is clear competitors may be overpriced relative to $LESL. Pool Corporation has a P/E ratio of **40**.**75** and serves as one of the largest competitors to Leslie\u2019s due to its vast network of clients. If we calculate Leslie\u2019s P/E ratio based on the expected EPS of $0.75, the predicted P/E is approximately 36. **However, the stock price does not reflect this value correctly.**\n\nLeslie\u2019s adjusted EBITDA of $9.5 million compared to $(8.1) million in the prior-year quarter showed an improvement of $17.6 million. They also raised their fiscal 2021 sales outlook by $75 million, Adjusted EBITDA by $25 million, and Adjusted net income per share by $0.10.\n\n**Gross profit increased 79.6% to $71.7 million** from $39.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 and gross margin was 37.2% compared to 31.6% in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 567 basis points.\n\n**Following the news of forward guidance that beat analyst estimates by 50%, $LESL dropped 1% and an overall 13% this month, as the massive red dildos annihilated calls. Considering the immense growth $LESL has gained over the past quarter, it\u2019s stock price should be around $32-$35 at fair value.**\n\n# Price Action\n\n**Here\u2019s where things get interesting with the price action:**\n\nThe price point of $LESL continued to grow upwards as shortages began to impact consumer goods early 2021. However, despite increased earnings, higher EBITDA and large scale customer improvements, **$LESL IS AT THE SAME PRICE AS IT WAS IN DECEMBER.**\n\nHOW is it that a company that has a **3600% higher** predicted EPS over the past 6 months due to increasing chlorine prices, is STILL AT THE SAME SHARE PRICE AS IT WAS IN DECEMBER. The day earnings come out, $LESL will blow away everyone with its balance sheet and numbers.\n\n# Analyst ANALysis:\n\nThe consensus between 10 different analysts is that **on average, $LESL has a price target of $34.** On the upper end it is predicted to be **$41** and on the lower end $28. Given the nature of analyst targets, even if the minimum value of $28 is considered, **$LESL is still being suppressed under its fair value.**\n\n**Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley\u2019s** current PT is a minimum of $30 and a maximum of **$38** from my understanding with several firms giving a **Strong Buy** rating. **Although ANALysts can be quite wrong, the general consensus across the industry indicates to me that $LESL is severely undervalued and is one of the best long-term and short-term summer plays in the market.**\n\n# \ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b Case:\n\n[Blackrock buying up America right now](https://preview.redd.it/k5pvm5yudn571.png?width=542&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3650b9158f78fceeda6359569d4c72e5c3712f0)\n\nThe primary bear case for Leslie\u2019s is a sudden drop in demand. As I mentioned earlier, even if chlorine supply chains magically started producing enough for the global market, $LESL would still have thousands of new pool owner customers who will need their product for years to come. If the coronavirus is somehow eradicated within the summer, and public sentiment about public pools grows more positive, this might slow down demand and result in less new pool builds than expected.\n\nAdditionally, other competitors may invest into their own chlorine pellet facilities to become vertically integrated, but not only would this require large initial capital investment, but time. By the time such a facility would be made (1-2 years), the Pool Boom could be over.\n\nFinally, there are always disruptors to consider in the overall macroeconomic environment. The current housing boom is driving the Poolpercycle, and rightfully so. However, this could change at any moment. A housing market crash would most likely cause many new homeowners to rethink their pool purchases, and potentially depress the overall market in the short-term. The main reason I do not think this will happen is because in 2008, the factors of subprime loans and irresponsible lending essentially self-fucked the average citizen and banks. In the 2021 market, we are seeing large investment firms like Blackrock, who manage trillions in assets, buy up hundreds of properties across the nation and rent them out to those who can afford it. The risk here is significantly less, and not dependent on any one individual. However, it is important to consider this aspect of the bear case.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\n# Through these findings, I believe that $LESL is a massively undervalued company. Its strong fundamental financials and continued pool supply consumption, leads me to believe that it\u2019s due for a large run up in the next month fueled by other institutions. I see Leslie hitting a PT of at least $32 within the next month or two.\n\n**My position is 100 contracts for 30C July 16th contracts and I will slowly build this up depending on price action throughout the month. I believe that Leslie\u2019s will be fucked up her butt with massive green dildos.**",

        "selftext": " To start, and As Always, I never give financial advice and this is not different. People ask why there is so much DDs about WISH!! Well, basically it was never a meme stock, there is no need to make memes about it to make it attractive, the approach is purely fundamental, and to explain that , there is no better way than a DD.  \n \n\nNow, I will try to explain why we believe (me and my wife)  that WISH is going to moon and it\u2019s just the beginning, trying not to talk about all the fundamentals and the points we already know.  \n \n\n1- As we can see in chart, for last week WISH was consolidating wating the 18/06 options to expire,   \n The great thing about this consolidation is that it\u2019s done with a verry hight volume (one of the highest on the market). In addition, Friday it closed above the 50 MA line. All these points are a verry strong bullish signs I believe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/wg8sa5yey8671.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dfd3a01671544732f56a9102d587aae75943fdc)\n\n2- I don\u2019t know if you were following what happened Friday, I think it was a war between buyers and sellers, The big boys did all what they could to push it down below 12$ , because they knew it could be a disaster for them if it went above 12.5$ (verry Hight open interest in the 12.5$ call options, that could cause a gamma/short squeeze ). So they succeeded controlling the price, But I think The Sell pressure will go down in the next weeks, because of risk/reward ratio is on the buyers side.\n\n3- The general sentiment on the media is going positive, a lot of positive articles on different online websites. Explaining what we were explaining 4 weeks ago about how the company is under evaluated (PS : I\u2019m the one who did the DD for his Wife \ud83d\ude09 ) \n\n4 \u2013 The fact that even when WISH was at 7.5$, management did not tried to push it up or give any comments, could be a verry bullish sign, that means they are concentrated on the long term and don\u2019t give that much consideration about the short term.\n\n5- The partnership with Prestashop , that gives it access to more than 300 000 merchants who are already using Prestashop. \n\n6- Verry hight volume for the July 16 call options (15$ and 20$ strikes) and even the 45$ strike have a hight volume than usual.\n\n7- With All this points, their will be more and more people noticing the stock (both who are waiting for technical signs and who buy only based on fundamentals). And because of it\u2019s current evaluation, it will be attractive even for the more conservative people, this is will make pressure on the Shorters, so we may see a decrease in the short interest in the next weeks.  \n \n\nFinally, all this points are my believes, I may be right and I may be wrong. But I\u2019m already All IN anyways (On stock and not on options)(and already shared my Yolo 4 weeks ago), I know I'm a half retard, but I came from a poor family, I dont mind if I lose it all, because I already know how it feels to be poor, and it's not that bad down their.",

GREEDY SHORTS ARE JUST TRYING TO STICK IT TO CHAMATH BY TRYING TO PUSH THIS BELOW $9.\n\nThe 200,000 DC members are the number of Medicare Part B patients they have access to through the 1,800 providers using their software.  They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time.  They set forecasts at 70,000 to 100,000 by end of 2021.  They already have 65,000 enrolled in April.  They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward.\n\nTo understand what CLOV should be worth today, look at OSH and AGL.  All three companies are Direct Contracting Entities (DCE) competing for risk-bearing Medicare patients.  They all should be valued based on the number of risk-based patients they have and how fast they're growing that number.  The value of each risk-based patient depends on each company's model, which drives profit rates.\n\n**OSH = $14.3B market cap**\n\nOSH is obviously liked the most by the market, probably because they employ the clinicians so they can keep more of the Medicare premium and could theoretically do more to improve health outcomes and control costs.

They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time.  They set forecasts at 70,000 to 100,000 by end of 2021.  They already have 65,000 enrolled in April.  They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward.\n\nTo understand what CLOV should be worth today, look at OSH and AGL.  All three companies are Direct Contracting Entities (DCE) competing for risk-bearing Medicare patients.  They all should be valued based on the number of risk-based patients they have and how fast they're growing that number.  The value of each risk-based patient depends on each company's model, which drives profit rates.\n\n**OSH = $14.3B market cap**\n\nOSH is obviously liked the most by the market, probably because they employ the clinicians so they can keep more of the Medicare premium and could theoretically do more to improve health outcomes and control costs.  In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% off the top, and the rest goes to OSH.\n\n* **OSH gross margin = 6.7%** ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/osh/financials))\n* **6,500 DC risk-based patients** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))\n* **75,500 total risk-based patients growing to 112,000 this year** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))\n* **That's a valuation of $125,000 per patient**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AGL = $14.3B market cap**\n\nAGL holds the contract with the MA plan and then pays the contracted (not employed) provider practices.  In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% of the premium off the top, and the rest is split between AGL and the provider practices.\n\n* **AGL gross margin = 7%** ([source](https://capital.com/agilon-health-ipo-will-the-stock-soar-in-2021))\n* **50,000 DC risk-based patients** ([source](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001831097/98fb566d-8f47-4a36-bd48-6bef5745cf56.pdf))\n* **165,300 total risk-based patients growing to 210,000 this year** ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-agilon-health-ipo/healthcare-platform-agilon-valued-at-about-11-billion-in-nyse-debut-idUSKBN2C22D7))\n* **That's a valuation of $66,667 per patient**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CLOV = $3.65B market cap**\n\nCLOV has historically been just a MA plan, taking the 15% of the premium off the top and paying the rest to cover the patient's costs.  MA plans have an average profit margin of 4.3% after all their admin and sales expenses are accounted for ([source](https://mhk.com/medicare-advantage-is-the-golden-egg-for-health-plans/)).\n\n* **CLOV historical gross margin (before COVID effect) = 2.5-4.1 %** ([source](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213))\n* **65,000 DC risk-based patients** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))\n* **132,000 total risk-based patients growing to 160,000 this year** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))\n* **That's a valuation of $22,800 per patient**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AGL is a good preview of how the DC model could be valued per patient, except the DC model should be even better.  There is no MA plan taking 15% off the top in between the risk-bearer (Direct Contracting Entity: CLOV, AGL, or OSH) and Medicare.  Direct Contracting patients could be valued as high as $76,667 (15% premium over current AGL patients).**\n\nThe CEO of OSH was recently quoted \"**the per-patient economics of that program will potentially be better than the company had initially estimated\"** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))**.**",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: Turn away if you believe that BABA is going to be broken up because Ma hurt some feelings over Ant.\n\nI personally discredit claims that BABA is in significant danger due to Ma's comments.

Coca Cola, the trusty dividend company, trades at 28 times earnings. Forward PE is even more egregious. BABA has sturdy competition in its retail business from Pinduoduo and JD, but BABA operates a platform with ancillary tools to keep merchants there, giving staying power. BABA is the leader in the transition to cloud (47% in 2019 according to Canalys). BABA is the inversed Amazon in terms of profitability. BABA makes money from their retail platform, doesn't get into the weeds, and is currently sacrificing profitability for market share in cloud.\n\nFurthermore, BABA has stakes in a wide range of logistics and consumer service companies. Even after appropriately discounting ADR and BABA being a Chinese company, to me it's criminally undervalued trading at a lower multiple than companies like KO while having clear future growth. Would love to hear how BABA deserves this low multiple.\n\nTLDR: BABA has growth in cloud, even after writing off their retail growth, with stakes in many companies, acting as a counterweight to the giant Tencent, all while trading at a lower multiple than companies like KO.\n\nEdit: Tomorrow is the biggest online shopping event (618) in China! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Dear fellow investors and apes,\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to highlight that I'm indeed a new account, so apologies to people that only trust \"buy and hodl to the moon\" comments/posts from old legit reddit users.\n\nSecondly, I already made a post where I highlighted several reasons why you should make a WISH and, if you haven't already read it, I suggest you do so as I will not repeat all the points on this post -&gt; [Why you should make a WISH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny69ns/why_you_should_make_a_wish/)\n\n# I hope you will realize that WISH is not a \"meme stock\" but a growth stock priced like a underpriced value one\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Peers selection for comparison**\n\nTo demonstrate that, I selected some peers and compared key metrics. The selected companies are the following:\n\n* Alibaba (BABA): Aliexpress marketplace is probably WISH's most direct competitor and represents 86% of BABA's revenue\n* Ebay (EBAY): Global marketplace but unlike WISH, people can also sell their items.\n* Mercadolibre (MELI): Commonly called the \"Ebay of Latin America\"\n* Poshmark (POSH): Marketplace to buy and sell new and secondhand cloths\n* Jumia (JMIA): e-commerce platform similar to WISH but active in Africa\n* Shopify (SHOP): Provider of commerce platform for merchants\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals comparison**\n\n*Methodology*:\n\n* Comparing 1) \"fundamentals metrics\" such as estimated revenue growth, estimated EBITDA Margin and current Debt-to-EV; 2) \"valuation metrics\" such as estimated price-to-sales EV-to-EBITDA ratios.\n* Estimations for revenues and EBITDAs are based on analysts forecasts from Bloomberg for 2025. (Note that POSH has forecasts until 2024 only).\n\n*Results*:\n\n* WISH has estimated revenue growth and EBITDA margin lower than average but lower debt ratio.\n* Assuming Ebay and Shopify are good proxies for a value and growth stock respectively, from a fundamental point-of-view WISH seems in-between.\n* However strikingly t its valuation ratios are even cheaper than Ebay's ones.\n* I believe that a discount in valuation is normal given its exposure to China and actual negative EBITDA, but the actual discount is just too huge compared to averages and companies in similar positions (JMIA and POSH).\n\n[Valuation metrics based on estimated fundamentals](https://preview.redd.it/w0bsc5re5z571.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b58cee3447c58959f262ccd49920bc885a39074)\n\n* Furthermore, based on the same analyst estimates, WISH profitability is expected to increase more sharply than peers as showed in the following chart. Note that I use expected EBITDA/EV (aka EBITDA yield) instead of EV/expected EBITDA, as the latter would provide meaningless results for negative EBITDAs (similar to a meaningless P/E ratio for negative earnings).\n\n[Evolution of estimated EBITDA yield](https://preview.redd.it/os6wwzlg5z571.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39a4467d140ecfb7391aaea200a5ac71337cd27e)\n\n**Analysts recommendation**\n\nThe gap between fundamentals and current valorization is clearly demonstrated in analysts recommendations. WISH has indeed the largest potential based on the average price target (PT) and even the worst PT is above current price. What is also interesting to note is that analysts are bullish on the industry as highlighted by no sell recommendations at all (expect one for Shopify) and a majority of buys.\n\n[Analysts price targets](https://preview.redd.it/8geoh3xk5z571.png?width=544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef74c03ff39ab4288c8a28db883418a7c19af096)\n\n**Price action**\n\nA key moment took place on the 13th of May when price dropped 30% to $8. That day, WISH published earnings below consensus (loss of $128m VS loss of $115m expected), revenue above ($772m VS $743m expected) and revenue forecast for Q2 below estimates ($715-730m VS consensus of $759m).\n\nI'd expect a drop in the price given the lower guidance compared to forecasts, however that day the company lost roughly a third of its value (though guidance was only 4-6% below). But guess what, the following day was precisely the end of the lock-up period and insiders could start selling their shares (check by yourself: [IPO prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm) page 200 at bottom)... Coincidence? Well I personally don't think so, market makers know very well this kind of information and given the important change in the float following the end of the lock-up (from 60m to 375m shares as shown in the following graph), I wouldn't be surprised if they kept lowering the price in order to buy shares from insiders at a wholesale price (in the end the market maker is indeed a wholesaler...)\n\n[Recent price action VS float \\(green line\\)](https://preview.redd.it/4879pa1n5z571.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b68ac7f96652ec5ec8a715ca1b761d51681d7f6e)\n\nRegarding short-term price action, there was a strong incentive for market makers/option writers to keep prices contained until end of the week due to options expiry. Indeed, 75% of the call contracts expiring in June are tied to strikes above or equal to $12.5 and 44% to options with strikes between $12.5 and $15. In fact, if WISH price closes above $15 today, more than the equivalent of 5.1% of float will be in the money, from which 3.1% for strikes $12.5 to $15 alone.\n\n[Open interests per strike for June Calls and Puts contracts](https://preview.redd.it/tw0qt1n66z571.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9f8ecb724d1586d2479308df4e0d1a123be3ad7)\n\nFrom a chart perspective, two key downtrend lines were broken (red and yellow lines. A key element that I believe would strongly contribute to a sustained upside momentum is a close above the 50-days moving average and the slope of that same moving average turning positive (green line). If that happens and with recent strong increase in volume, I believe that more buyers will join the party (institutional investors, momentum algos, etc).\n\nPS: Note how market makers managed to keep the closing prices below the 50-days MA every single day since Reddit apes' interest on the stock...\n\n[Technical analysis on chart](https://preview.redd.it/b64qoc127z571.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=940175f4bae42f2bab57a396f77f0ef6eaf863d8)\n\n**To conclude, I personally believe that WISH is an attractive opportunity based on his risk/return profil. I do expect some selling pressure from insiders, which is normal as their shares represent an important bulk position in their respective portfolio, but I strongly believe that momentum will soon turn positive, opening the way to a strong upside.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**^(Disclaimer: This is not a financial advice or recommendation, I'm just sharing my own analysis and I highly suggest you do your own as well. I'm invested in WISH.)**\n\n*^(Source for figures and chart: Bloomberg)*",

        "selftext": "So I took positions against SPY today (and against the DOW, A/K/A \"Boomer SPY\") because I noticed what I thought to be a divergence between the movement of the market and the underlying indicators.\n\nFrom April 23 to June 17th/18th we can see the following:\n\nThe price of SPY has increased slightly.\n\nThe MACD has formed two bear crosses. Importantly: the second cross is at a lower point than the first cross, and thus it diverges with the underlying direction of the stock price (which is positive).\n\nThe RSI is also at a lower point on June 17th than it was on Aril 23, despite the underlying price going up.\n\nBelow is everything I've described thus far summed up in a doodle:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vabpwvs9s3671.jpg?width=1108&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bbdc21acb8bf33d5b1245b33d68e7d63cc73040\n\nGenerally, when you see the indicators moving in a bearish direction while the stock is moving in a bullish direction it can be an indication that the stock price may reverse. This is also known as a divergence.\n\nAnother bearish indicator can be when a candle closes below a moving average. Swing traders tend to look at the 9 day and 50 day moving averages for confirmation of whether to enter or exit positions. Here, we can we can see a full candle close below the 9-day MA on 6/17 and a full close below the 50-day on 6/18. I think this is pretty significant because these candle closes formed right after the lower RSI/MACD figures.\n\nFor full disclosure I have positions in SPXS (which is a 3X inverse SPY ETF) and SDOW (which is a 3X inverse DOW ETF). I think we may see a continued reversal into next week based on this information and I'm posting this because I'm curious if other people are taking similar positions, or at least selling positions in anticipation of a reversal?\n\nAlso this is not financial advice. Nothing on this sub is financial advice.\n\nAnd yes, I do have a beard.",

        "selftext": "Hey all, please see below my deep dive analysis on Tencent ($TCEHY). I know Chinese stocks are highly controversial, so it\u2019d be great to hear opinions from both sides.\n\n**What Does Tencent Do?**\n\n* Tencent is the largest company in China and has just way too many businesses and so in this section, I will be focusing on the three you need to know as an investor, which include QQ and WeChat, gaming, and Tencent\u2019s investment portfolio\n* **QQ and WeChat**\n   * Just as a bit of history, Tencent was founded in 1998 by current CEO Pony Ma and 4 other founders who were college friends\n   * Their first product was OICQ which was later renamed to **QQ** and was a messaging application that still exists today and boasts [**more than 606 million monthly active users**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ProductListofTencent.pdf)\n   * But the jewel in the crown is **WeChat** which is known as Weixin in China which was launched in 2011 and now serves over [**1.2 billion users**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ProductListofTencent.pdf)\n   * These two applications are at the core of Tencent\u2019s business model and drive the entire ecosystem by enabling Tencent to launch a suite of other products like such as games, music, payment transactions, and more. Basically, you can think of WeChat as a\u00a0super app that combines Facebook, Shopify, Uber, GoogleMaps,\u00a0WhatsApp, TikTok and a whole lot more.\n   * **It\u2019s really hard to overstate the power of WeChat.** I\u2019ve read in my research that even homeless people in China use WeChat to receive money and when I was doing business with suppliers in China for my old business, I only used WeChat to communicate\n   * Because of this, **there are just an endless number of ways for Tencent to continue building out its ecosystem** because they can always add new functionalities to WeChat like the TikTok feature they added when they saw TikTok dominating or TenPay to take on Alipay\n* **Gaming**\n   * Though WeChat is the engine that drives Tencent\u2019s business, **gaming is actually the** [**real money maker and profit driver**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ResultsPresentation.pdf) **for the company**\n   * Tencent has been involved in the gaming industry since 2004 and since then has become the **second largest player** **in the world** after Sony with $13.9 billion in revenue\n      * The company holds a dominant **43% market share in China** and owns the **top 3 PC games and top 2 mobile games published in 2020**\n      * Another important thing to note is\u00a0that given the PC and console markets have been stalling, **Tencent has been focusing a lot of its attention to mobile gaming,** which now owns\u00a0roughly **70% market share**\u00a0of the gaming market\n   * **Tencent obviously has a natural advantage with WeChat** given\u00a0that it\u2019s a mobile app that can be used to market to 1.2 billion users, but another one of Tencent's advantages is **Yingyong Bao** which is also known as Tencent My App and is China\u2019s leading Android app store with [**26% market share**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1058612/china-android-app-store-market-share/)\n      * So basically, if you\u2019re a game creator, not only do you have to create a game that competes against the resources and teams Tencent has, but whenever Tencent releases a game, it can automatically market it through WeChat users and feature the app on Tencent My App\n      * All of this would result in the game being downloaded more and becoming the number one most downloaded gaming app even though it may not standalone be the best game\n   * As a result, it may come as no surprise that Tencent owns a dominant [**52% of China\u2019s mobile gaming market**](https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mobile-games2-1.jpg)\n   * **Believe it or not, this is not where the dominance ends.** Just take a look at all the [**investments**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent) Tencent has made in some of the world\u2019s top gaming companies including Riot Games, Supercell, Epic Games, and Activision Blizzard\n* **Tencent\u2019s investment portfolio**\n   * First of all, it\u2019s important to note that while Tencent does own a majority stake in many businesses, **the company\u2019s investment philosophy is well known to be hands-off** meaning that after they invest, they just let the company do its thing\n   * Tencent owns a very impressive portfolio of 800+ companies including 20% of Meituan, 100% of Riot Games, 25.6% of Sea, and even 5% of Tesla\n      * Based on the last calculated market value of these companies, Tencent\u2019s ownership from its portfolio is estimated **$331 billion (couldn't provide source link due to subreddit rules)**\n      * A large part of Tencent\u2019s growth strategy is inorganic and the company has shown no signs of slowing down\n\n**The Bull Case**\n\n* **Reason #1 - WeChat which is a nearly impenetrable moat that Tencent will enjoy for at least another decade or two**\n   * WeChat users spent **$115 billion** **through mini programs in 2019** and exact figures weren\u2019t disclosed in Tencent\u2019s 2020 annual report but I did find that in their report that annual transaction volume from Mini programs doubled in 2020\n   * All of this is important because while WeChat is a dominant force, user growth has been slowing given that it already penetrates nearly all of China and so it\u2019ll be important for Tencent to continue monetizing on its users to propel further growth\n* In order to not be too repetitive, I won\u2019t touch upon gaming and Tencent\u2019s investment portfolio\n* **Reason #2 - Livestreaming**\n   * Tencent owns a dominant **37% and 38% stake in China\u2019s largest gaming streaming sites named Huya and Douyu** and has been pushing for the two companies to merge\n   * This would remove a lot of the competition between the two platforms which control **90% of the streaming market** but the deal is uncertain to pass due to the heightened antitrust environment\n   * But either way, Tencent still owns a commanding share of the two companies and live streaming is a fast growing industry that serves as a **great complement to Tencent\u2019s gaming business**\n* **Reason #3 - Tencent's fintech and business services**\n   * This is the **fastest growing segment of Tencent\u2019s business** and it grew by 47% year over year in the first quarter of 2021\n   * Regarding fintech, Tencent has been able to take considerable share away from Alipay through Tenpay which currently accounts for about **39% of transactions,** which is up from about 10% in 2014\n      * **Tenpay is basically like Venmo or Paypal on steroids** and it allows for cashless transactions amongst peers and merchants, while also providing services like loans that are approved within 3 minutes and a whole lot more\n      * **Regarding the cloud, Tencent holds the 3rd place spot** in terms of market share and given that the overall industry grew by 62% in Q4 2020, I\u2019m sure Tencent will be putting a lot of efforts into this business segment\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\n* **Reason #1 - Regulatory risk by the Chinese Communist Party or CCP**\n   * Unlike Jack Ma who notoriously spoke out against the party and caused many issues for Alibaba, **Tencent is known to have a very strong relationship with the government**\n   * Even still, the CCP can at any time change its policies that can hurt Tencent\u2019s business with one such example being in **2018 when the CCP stopped approving gaming licenses for 9 months**\n   * There have also been a lot of **antitrust news** and Tencent is expected to pay a fine of around **$1.5 billion for anticompetitive practices** and the CCP can do things like this out of thin air\n* **Reason #2 - Political unrest between China and the rest of the world**\n   * While President, Trump issued an order to ban WeChat transactions which never actually took effect and was recently **revoked by the Biden administration**\n   * Still, the risk remains especially in the case that China grows way too powerful that **countries will work to limit its power,** such as making Tencent sell off its US holdings if an anti-China US president came to power\n   * What should be noted though is that **Tencent\u2019s business mostly resides in China (97%),** so there would be notable but minimal impact\n* **Reason #3 - WeChat is dominant but slowing in growth**\n   * One of the newest and fiercest competitors is **ByteDance** which is the company behind Douyin / Tiktok\n   * [**TikTok has over 689 million monthly active users while Douyin has over 600 million,**](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/) and as we\u2019ve seen with WeChat, once you have the users, your opportunities to create additional businesses are endless\n   * In a sign of what may be to come, **ByteDance created a hit game** and may be starting to encroach upon Tencent\u2019s gaming dominance\n   * That said, Bytedance has a long way to go, having earned just $42 million with its top game vs. hundreds of millions for Tencent and **previous game launches have been unsuccessful**\n* **Reason #4 - Tencent trades in the US as a Level 1 ADR**\n   * [**Level 1 ADRs trade on OTC markets**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/what-are-differences-between-levels-i-ii-and-iii-american-depository-receipts-adrs.asp) and don\u2019t need to abide by GAAP accounting which result in less reliability and transparency\n   * I don\u2019t think that Tencent would commit accounting fraud given that the company is so large now but they are operating with some looser standards and this is something to keep in mind\n   * There was also some talk about the US delisting Chinese ADRs so again, this is another risk\n\n**Financials &amp; Valuation**\n\n* Starting off with the [financials](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21CorporateOverview.pdf)\u00a0(refer to this link for the datapoints I reference below), Tencent is a highly profitable business with an adjusted EBITDA margin that has hovered around 40% for the past few years which is extremely solid\n   * The company has just about as much cash as debt and normally you might want to see a larger cash position, but Tencent is generating so much in free cash flow that it really doesn\u2019t matter\n   * For instance, the company\u2019s debt to adjusted EBITDA is around 1.3x and for this ratio, about 6.0x is where you would get really worried about being\u00a0over leveraged and so Tencent is way below that\n* Regarding valuation, I\u2019ll be referring to this [table](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4FkTDhVoAAluTO?format=jpg&amp;name=large)\u00a0and comparing Tencent to its peers (trading comps)\n   * Amongst the\u00a0Chinese peers, we can see that **Tencent\u2019s revenue growth is in the\u00a0middle of the pack** but its **profitability numbers** aka its EBITDA margin, profit margin, and free cash flow yield **lead the pack**\n   * This along with Tencent\u2019s competitive moat and impressive investment portfolio is probably why **Tencent is trading at a premium versus its Chinese peers**\n   * **Amongst the U.S. peers,** we see that **Tencent is growing the fastest in revenue while is more in the middle of the pack for profitability**\n   * You can also see that Tencent is in the middle of the pack when it comes to multiples vs. its U.S. peers meaning that **Tencent is not cheap vs. its U.S. peers either**\n* Based on all this I think Tencent is an amazing business with a nearly impenetrable moat in various industries, but there are a lot of risks investing in Chinese companies, so I\u2019d want to invest in companies that are a bit more discounted so I can have a higher margin of safety\n* **Tencent is not the cheapest company vs. its Chinese peers nor its U.S. peers** and so for me, I would want to see Tencent trading at much lower multiples before I invest, probably somewhere around 15x 2022 EBITDA (loosely speaking)\n   * This is because I could simply invest in U.S. companies at a better valuation while not taking on the risks that come with investing in Chinese companies\n   * That said, if you believe that China will vastly outgrow U.S. companies and are not as sensitive to the risks with Chinese stocks, Tencent\u2019s moat may be enough to warrant an investment with a long-term time horizon\n\n**TLDR:** Tencent with WeChat, its gaming business, and investment portfolio has an incredible moat. That said, the company is not trading cheaply and so personally I would wait for the price to come down a bit before investing. That said, I welcome all counter points and it\u2019d be great to hear your thoughts.",

        "selftext": "Hello, I am a 17 yo relatively new investor. I have come across this quote \"diversification is for idiots\" from Mark Cuban, and I know Warren Buffett has said in the past that intelligent investors don't need a diversified portfolio. Now I've also come across advice advocating for diversification, and in the past have found myself investing in companies for the sake of diversification and not necessarily my belief in the company. I have realized that what I'm looking for in a company is found most in the technology and finance sectors, and so that is what most of my portfolio has become.\n\nIf you're wondering, this is my current portfolio:\n\n* MA\n* SOXX \n* MSFT\n* QFIN\n* GOOGL\n* FINV\n* CROX\n* MCO\n* PYPL\n\nI have been reading books on investing, especially on Warren Buffett's strategies--investing in good financials with a wide moat. As said before, mainly financial and tech stocks fit my standard for this, and I see it as unwise to invest in other companies purely for the sake of diversification. I'd rather invest in a few companies that I truly believe in. It's riskier, I know, but such risk is mitigated by my standard for the stock. Obviously I do not have much experience investing, so I cannot for sure know that this method is better (at the end of the year I plan to benchmark my returns against a total market etf like VTI to evaluate the method). Of course I don't know what I don't know, so I don't want to get too confident in my picks. I'm wondering what more experienced investors have to say about it.",

        "selftext": "# What is Corsair?\n\nCorsair is a gaming company which has recently gained a lot of popularity because of Wallstreetbets and rightfully so, in my opinion. They sell computer peripherals, gaming and studio accessories, custom-made PCs, components, services and so on, effectively offering customers a one-stop shop for anything related to computer hardware, gaming software and other computer services. The company believes that they can address a market size of up to $46B or about 24 times larger than their current market share of $1.9B and they are expanding rapidly to make this happen. Over the last 12 months, Corsair acquired 3 new companies and launched 84 new products while showing a 47% growth in revenue in the latest quarter as compared to last year, 104% growth in gross profit and a staggering 197% growth in adjusted EBITDA! So, how are they achieving this massive growth?\u00a0Essentially, Corsair is trying to tap two of the fastest growing markets right now, gaming and eSports, plus digital content creation\u00a0which can be seen in their two main revenue streams: Gaming Component and Systems, and Gamer and Creator Peripherals which were split relatively evenly last quarter in terms of sales.\u00a0\n\nCorsair is using the growth in the eSports market which is estimated to grow 11% annually over the next 5 years to kickstart their own growth. If you think about it, all of those millennials that grew up playing games are now able to afford specialised gaming gear which is what Corsair is offering. We're also seeing a big number of Generation Z entering the labour market and being able to afford more expensive gaming gear. Gaming and esports have already become mainstream with professional gamers earning serious cash and rivalling mainstream sport athletes in earnings so we can tell that this is just the beginning of it.\n\nThe digital content creation market is also growing at an annual rate of 13% across the board. YouTube, Twitch and other video, streaming and podcasting platforms are experiencing a massive surge in both creators and users.\u00a0Corsair wants to use to this to drive their sales using\u00a0their Creator Peripherals products. Working from home has also led a lot of people to improve their home offices and that trend is here to stay, which provides even more opportunities for Corsair to tap into yet another growing market.\n\nFinally, the company wants to convert existing customers into loyal customers that come back to buy again and again and again. To do that, they are driving engagement through social media and they currently have a combined following of over 20mln across 4 different social media websites, plus they are represented by over 800 different influencers with a reach of over 1.3B people! They also offer customisation and personalisation in their products, they are focusing to be the\u00a0best-in-class hardware and on selling solutions, services and software that will cater to the needs of gamers and creators.\u00a0\u00a0Customer retention is always a winning strategy for companies when it comes down to optimising earnings and it is good to see that Corsair is focusing on it although I would also like them to start sharing some KPIs that track this.\u00a0\n\n# Bullish Thesis\n\nBefore I go into my bullish thesis, I want to point out that the current stock price that I am looking at is $36. Alright, so, the company doesn't really have any strong rivals in my opinion which is a strong bullish argument.\u00a0There is Pegatron, but the company has suffered a lot over the last year due to labor violations. Another is Razer, but they haven't shown a lot of promise over the last year either.\u00a0The closest rival is probably Logitech, but their business model and strategy are much different than Corsair's and I think that Corsair has a much better positioning to tap into the growing markets. Still, both Logitech and Corsair have performed amazingly over the last 12 months although I see Corsair as having a much better potential for growth. Right now, it is only a seventh of the size of Logitech with a $3.3B market cap versus Logitech's $21.7B although Corsair's revenue is less than 3 times smaller than Logitech's with a $1.9B vs $5.2B in revenue. Their Price-to-Sales ratio is 1.74 for Corsair and 4.14 for Logitech so we can see that Corsair is actually undervalued in terms of sales. The main reason why Corsair is lagging behind is their net income which is still relatively low, but as I mentioned earlier in this video, their growth is supercharged and off the charts. Plus, this is completely understandable for a company that is in its early growth phase. Another bullish argument is the fact that\u00a0a lot of hedge funds and institutions are betting AGAINST Corsair which gives us the opportunity for a short squeeze! About 18% of Corsair's share float is shorted, which is extremely high and completely unjustified in my opinion! The company is performing extremely well and they are trading at a low price. Their forward PE is only 17.9 which is tiny for a growth company as opposed to Logitech's forward PE of 27! Plus, Corsair absolutely CRUSHED their latest earnings, beating earnings per share by $0.25 or about 75%. They also beat their revenue estimate by $76M or almost 17% AND, to top it all of,\u00a0they raised their guidance, but the price still dropped! Analysts keep revising their earnings estimates up, which is yet another bullish signal. Plus, Corsair has enough current assets to cover their current liabilities and has a low debt so financial health is not really a problem. They have one Venture Capital fund, EagleTree Capital, hold 62% of the company and insiders hold another 4% which gives us a massive, absolutely massive opportunity for price growth especially when we look at their tiny market cap! I honestly think that Corsair can easily double in price and still be a relatively good purchase. The company is that good. Finbox's DCF model currently gives us a 43% upside with a target price of $51.5 and SimplyWallstreet's DCF model gives us a fair value of $80.3, a 123% upside so we can see that there are some decent bullish arguments behind Corsair.\u00a0However you look at it, Corsair is a beast of a company and an absolute bargain.\u00a0\n\nThere is no point in technical analysis right now. WSB boosted the stock and distorted all the signals. The only thing that's worth looking at is the 50D MA which is currently around $32-$33 and whether it will act as support for the current price. We can reasonably expect $40-$42 to serve as a resistance at this point.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nHonestly, out of all the companies that I've been researching recently, this one looks the most promising. Corsair is one of my biggest holdings right now and I will just keep adding to it.",

        "selftext": "I just saw a comment on a post that said that AMZN is currently undervalued. I\u2019ve had AMZN on my watchlist for a while and I\u2019ve been trying to find a decent entry point for some time.\n\nSo, I had a look at AMZN\u2019s valuation and I saw a P/S ratio of 4.03 and a P/E ratio of 63.7, both of which would _usually_ indicate that a stock is very overvalued.\n\nI\u2019m still of the opinion that AMZN might actually still be overvalued, and that we\u2019re still going to have to wait sometime until we see some growth there.\n\nThe situation with AAPL is quite bad too; P/S is 6.49 and P/E is 28.43. GOOGL, V, MA, MSFT and pretty much any kind of large cap tech stock has ridiculously high valuation figures.\n\nSo my question is, why do people continue to think that tech stocks are a great buy with these kinds of figures? To me personally, it appears that a lot of the anticipated growth is already heavily priced in, and that growth in the stock itself will take a long time (that is until the company\u2019s intrinsic value catches up with it\u2019s valuation).",

Yes that causes a dilution, but the few cents it could potentially drop don't compare the the huge value and growth it brings later.So...\n\n**If you are a long term investor who believes in the future of the company:** Offerings will be a good thing.\n\n**If you are swinging the merger:** It literally has no affect on you in anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**==================**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The ex Dividend date is June 24th. You must purchase shares by closing of June 22 and hold until closing of June 24th in order to receive the dividend. WHICH MEANS YOU MUST PURCHASE BY TOMORROW TO GET THESE DIVIDENDS \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WE DO NOT KNOW THE AMOUNT OF THE DIVIDEND, the CEO says it can range anywhere from 1-20 based off the worth of oil assets, with oil assets being worth a lot right now,  that is a good sign for the dividend price **\n\nThere is many estimates about the amount ranging from $1 all the way to $45.00, but we DO NOT know currently what the payout will be, although most bullish estimates have the dividend around 20 dollars per share.\n\nBut, this section won\u2019t be a dividend estimate. It's important that you understand what Meta actually is.\n\nMetamaterial Inc is a company that is developing mass production techniques of something called Meta Materials. So what are meta materials? Well, it's complicated and god knows I wont be able to properly explain it here (I'd recommend watching some youtube videos or something because visualizing it helps), but I can give you at least some surface level understanding. Meta materials are nano structure composites, it's a way of rearranging the sub molecular particles so that waves will interact with the material in ways that are not normally found in nature. For example; We see gold as a gold color, we see it that way because light waves hit the gold and the particles it interacts with and reflect that light at a certain wavelength that our eyes perceive as the gold color we see. Metamaterials could print that gold in a way that it rearranges the orientation of the particles and cause the light waves to refract from it at a completely different wavelength, making that gold appear a different color, effectively creating gold that is now the color green, or blue, or whatever color, all whilst not changing the chemical composition.\n\nAnother example would be the refraction of light through a pair of glasses, normally the more correction you want your lenses to have, the thicker your glasses would need to be, with meta materials you could alter the way that light waves interact with the material, allowing you to have a material that is only a few atoms thick bend that light refraction on a nano scale in the same way as the super thick coke bottle glasses.\n\nNow these are just some poorly explained examples, but the point here is that metamaterials refract wave lengths in a controlled way on a nano scale, and not just light waves, but also sound or magnetic waves. Which can do amazing things, from more accurate ultrasounds, to more efficient solar panels, to AR glasses with super tiny pixel sizes, to laser protection.... the list is truly endless...\n\nThe more important part to all this is not what meta materials can do, because they can do things that are so insane that it's bordering on the realm of alchemy and magic. The important part here is producing them. For the last decade meta materials have existed soley in university labs, produced on an incredibly small scale, Metamaterial Inc is the first company working towards scaled up mass production of this stuff. That is a BIG DEAL. Having the ability to mass produce nano structure composites opens up the door to unimaginable technology of the future, all the scifi nano tech concepts you've heard talked about will actually become a real and viable thing on a consumer level. We are talking about printing materials on a nano scale, any and all technology can benefit from success of Meta. They have already accrued a number of important partnerships, and once it hits nasdaq there is many many more to come. Basically every tech company needs someone to succeed at printing nano structure composites, it's a fundamental part of developing any and all nano tech, and meta is the first to actually work towards the development of scaling up mass production.\n\nThe potential growth of this company is hard to even quantify because nothing like this has ever been attempted. I get it, you want dividends, but know what you have here. This is not AMC or GME \"DESTROY THE HEDGE FUNDS\" sorta meme stock, we aren't here to fight the man, we are here to change the world. This is an investment in the success and growth of a company.\n\nI know a lot of apes don't fully understand investing or why stocks actually exist in the first place, but hopefully the picture I drew can help them grasp why they shouldn't simply pump and dump, and why not everything is a battle against the shorts.\n\nTRCH dividend DD. Why I think it will be more than the current share price $10.6\n\nFor those looking for answers to the special dividend question, I can not give a definite price but can tell you that it's in between the Bears (0.36) prediction and the Apes ($50 TO THE MOON) prediction. Remember, to get the one time special dividend, you must have acquired your shares before the closing bell tomorrow (6-22-2021) and held those shares through the closing bell (6-24-2021).\n\nMMAT technologies are the future and a very exciting long term play in my opinion, hope you read the whole DD. For those that did not read the DD and are just here for dividend confirmation bias, lets look at the numbers (taken from the Torchlight section of the DD).\n\n**TRCH Oil and Gas Assets** (Orogrande Basin \u2013 134,000 acre lease calculated by u/Saint_O_Well)\n\n **Valuation** :  The value oil drilling acreage is a moving target due to changes in crude oil prices. Current (06/21/2021) West Texas Crude price is $71.64 [https://www.up.com/customers/surcharge/wti/prices/index.htm](https://www.up.com/customers/surcharge/wti/prices/index.htm) crude prices have been rising 20 days straight, and up 76% since same time last year. \n\nSaint used 0.50 per barrel in his calculations (I work in oil &amp; gas industry, 0.50 is low, but we'll use this as floor price evaluation). Also worth noting  Drilling rights in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico averaged [about $24,000 an acre](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/11/12/plunging-shale-acreage-values-may-create-new-permian-ma-wave) in recent deals. Thus, lets eliminate some of the smaller calculations that Saint presented in his DD and get to reasonable evaluations that Saint calculated.\n\n**Acreage Valuations:**\n\n**A**. 134,000 acres \\*72.5% interest at $5000 acre=485.75m+12.75m (Hazel/Winkler) =500.25/143.6m shares= **$3.48 per share**\n\n**B.** 134,000 acres \\*72.5% interest at $7500 acre=728.63m+12.75m (Hazel/Winkler) =741.38/143.6m shares= **$5.16 per share**\n\n**Oil Valuations:**\n\n**A.** Medium  Case estimate 3.7 billion recoverable barrels \\* 72.5% interest at 50  cents per barrel= 1.34bn+12.75m (Hazel/Winkler) =1.3527b = **$9.42 per  share**\n\n**B**. High Case estimate  5.0 billion recoverable barrels \\* 72.5% interest at 50 cents per barrel=  3.625+12.75m (Hazel/Winkler) =3.638b =**$25.33 per share**\n\nSo in my opinion, no one is buying this land just to be buying land (unless they plan on opening up a dirt farm), the real price is in the minimum 3 billion barrels of recoverable oil. And while we would all love to see TRCH sell these assets for $24,000 an acre and 0.50 per 3 billion (projected) barrels of oil. The price would be more in line with adding acreage valuation A with Oil valuation A, so like $13 give or take. Keep in mind that these valuations do not include the sale of any other assets already on the land in the form of equipment, so it will be a little higher. I read some bear calculated just the projected equipment sales that came out to $0.36 and was trying to say that is all the divi would be (wrong).\n\nThe Bear case (no one likes bears, not even their own mothers) that the dividend will be lower is that regulations on the oil and gas industry, especially in drilling and fracking will cause a lower than expected sale of TRCH assets, resulting in a lower dividend.\n\nThe Bull case that the dividend will be higher is the Orogrande site  is considered to be the [largest domestic newfield discovery in over 30 years](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2019/06/25/torchlight-drops-a-bombshell-for-shareholders.html) .  The Orogrande site has had several [successful test wells drilled](https://www.canadianinsider.com/torchlight-announces-measured-oil-and-gas-production-from-its-orogrande-basin-project), and has an estimated 3-5 billion barrels of oil ready to be extracted. And as someone who works in flowback (oil production) the demand for the Orogrande site and its existing wells is incredibly high with the current administrations regulations on new drilling and fracking. Basically, whoever purchases these assets TRCH are set to make 10's of billions. \n\nI am not a financial advisor, and this DD is not financial advice, nor is it a confirmation of what the TRCH dividend will be. I am bullish on this stock, the dividend price, and the future of Meta going forward. My best educated guess on what I've seen in the oilfield, rising price of crude, and the interest in acquisition of the Orogrande site, **I wouldn't be shocked to se a dividend in the $13 - $15 range.**\n\n**TL/DR:** No one knows divi price, but I don't think anyone will be disappointed once we find out.  I see it being in the 10-20 dollars a share range, which is an insane return for just holding the stock for a couple days. For those waiting for \"MOASS\" and wondering what to invest in afterwards, take a long look at MMAT. I believe Meta will be a $300- $500 stock in a few years. To get the dividend, you must buy before close tomorrow and hold until Friday. \n\nPositions: 280 shares @8.6",

        "selftext": "Hey all, please see below my deep dive analysis on Tencent ($TCEHY). I know Chinese stocks are highly controversial, so it\u2019d be great to hear opinions from both sides.\n\n**What Does Tencent Do?**\n\n* Tencent is the largest company in China and has just way too many businesses and so in this section, I will be focusing on the three you need to know as an investor, which include QQ and WeChat, gaming, and Tencent\u2019s investment portfolio\n* **QQ and WeChat**\n   * Just as a bit of history, Tencent was founded in 1998 by current CEO Pony Ma and 4 other founders who were college friends\n   * Their first product was OICQ which was later renamed to **QQ** and was a messaging application that still exists today and boasts [**more than 606 million monthly active users**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ProductListofTencent.pdf)\n   * But the jewel in the crown is **WeChat** which is known as Weixin in China which was launched in 2011 and now serves over [**1.2 billion users**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ProductListofTencent.pdf)\n   * These two applications are at the core of Tencent\u2019s business model and drive the entire ecosystem by enabling Tencent to launch a suite of other products like such as games, music, payment transactions, and more. Basically, you can think of WeChat as a\u00a0super app that combines Facebook, Shopify, Uber, GoogleMaps,\u00a0WhatsApp, TikTok and a whole lot more.\n   * **It\u2019s really hard to overstate the power of WeChat.** I\u2019ve read in my research that even homeless people in China use WeChat to receive money and when I was doing business with suppliers in China for my old business, I only used WeChat to communicate\n   * Because of this, **there are just an endless number of ways for Tencent to continue building out its ecosystem** because they can always add new functionalities to WeChat like the TikTok feature they added when they saw TikTok dominating or TenPay to take on Alipay\n* **Gaming**\n   * Though WeChat is the engine that drives Tencent\u2019s business, **gaming is actually the** [**real money maker and profit driver**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ResultsPresentation.pdf) **for the company**\n   * Tencent has been involved in the gaming industry since 2004 and since then has become the **second largest player** **in the world** after Sony with $13.9 billion in revenue\n      * The company holds a dominant **43% market share in China** and owns the **top 3 PC games and top 2 mobile games published in 2020**\n      * Another important thing to note is\u00a0that given the PC and console markets have been stalling, **Tencent has been focusing a lot of its attention to mobile gaming,** which now owns\u00a0roughly **70% market share**\u00a0of the gaming market\n   * **Tencent obviously has a natural advantage with WeChat** given\u00a0that it\u2019s a mobile app that can be used to market to 1.2 billion users, but another one of Tencent's advantages is **Yingyong Bao** which is also known as Tencent My App and is China\u2019s leading Android app store with [**26% market share**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1058612/china-android-app-store-market-share/)\n      * So basically, if you\u2019re a game creator, not only do you have to create a game that competes against the resources and teams Tencent has, but whenever Tencent releases a game, it can automatically market it through WeChat users and feature the app on Tencent My App\n      * All of this would result in the game being downloaded more and becoming the number one most downloaded gaming app even though it may not standalone be the best game\n   * As a result, it may come as no surprise that Tencent owns a dominant [**52% of China\u2019s mobile gaming market**](https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mobile-games2-1.jpg)\n   * **Believe it or not, this is not where the dominance ends.** Just take a look at all the [**investments**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent) Tencent has made in some of the world\u2019s top gaming companies including Riot Games, Supercell, Epic Games, and Activision Blizzard\n* **Tencent\u2019s investment portfolio**\n   * First of all, it\u2019s important to note that while Tencent does own a majority stake in many businesses, **the company\u2019s investment philosophy is well known to be hands-off** meaning that after they invest, they just let the company do its thing\n   * Tencent owns a very impressive portfolio of 800+ companies including 20% of Meituan, 100% of Riot Games, 25.6% of Sea, and even 5% of Tesla\n      * Based on the last calculated market value of these companies, Tencent\u2019s ownership from its portfolio is estimated **$331 billion (couldn't provide source link due to subreddit rules)**\n      * A large part of Tencent\u2019s growth strategy is inorganic and the company has shown no signs of slowing down\n\n**The Bull Case**\n\n* **Reason #1 - WeChat which is a nearly impenetrable moat that Tencent will enjoy for at least another decade or two**\n   * WeChat users spent **$115 billion** **through mini programs in 2019** and exact figures weren\u2019t disclosed in Tencent\u2019s 2020 annual report but I did find that in their report that annual transaction volume from Mini programs doubled in 2020\n   * All of this is important because while WeChat is a dominant force, user growth has been slowing given that it already penetrates nearly all of China and so it\u2019ll be important for Tencent to continue monetizing on its users to propel further growth\n* In order to not be too repetitive, I won\u2019t touch upon gaming and Tencent\u2019s investment portfolio\n* **Reason #2 - Livestreaming**\n   * Tencent owns a dominant **37% and 38% stake in China\u2019s largest gaming streaming sites named Huya and Douyu** and has been pushing for the two companies to merge\n   * This would remove a lot of the competition between the two platforms which control **90% of the streaming market** but the deal is uncertain to pass due to the heightened antitrust environment\n   * But either way, Tencent still owns a commanding share of the two companies and live streaming is a fast growing industry that serves as a **great complement to Tencent\u2019s gaming business**\n* **Reason #3 - Tencent's fintech and business services**\n   * This is the **fastest growing segment of Tencent\u2019s business** and it grew by 47% year over year in the first quarter of 2021\n   * Regarding fintech, Tencent has been able to take considerable share away from Alipay through Tenpay which currently accounts for about **39% of transactions,** which is up from about 10% in 2014\n      * **Tenpay is basically like Venmo or Paypal on steroids** and it allows for cashless transactions amongst peers and merchants, while also providing services like loans that are approved within 3 minutes and a whole lot more\n      * **Regarding the cloud, Tencent holds the 3rd place spot** in terms of market share and given that the overall industry grew by 62% in Q4 2020, I\u2019m sure Tencent will be putting a lot of efforts into this business segment\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\n* **Reason #1 - Regulatory risk by the Chinese Communist Party or CCP**\n   * Unlike Jack Ma who notoriously spoke out against the party and caused many issues for Alibaba, **Tencent is known to have a very strong relationship with the government**\n   * Even still, the CCP can at any time change its policies that can hurt Tencent\u2019s business with one such example being in **2018 when the CCP stopped approving gaming licenses for 9 months**\n   * There have also been a lot of **antitrust news** and Tencent is expected to pay a fine of around **$1.5 billion for anticompetitive practices** and the CCP can do things like this out of thin air\n* **Reason #2 - Political unrest between China and the rest of the world**\n   * While President, Trump issued an order to ban WeChat transactions which never actually took effect and was recently **revoked by the Biden administration**\n   * Still, the risk remains especially in the case that China grows way too powerful that **countries will work to limit its power,** such as making Tencent sell off its US holdings if an anti-China US president came to power\n   * What should be noted though is that **Tencent\u2019s business mostly resides in China (97%),** so there would be notable but minimal impact\n* **Reason #3 - WeChat is dominant but slowing in growth**\n   * One of the newest and fiercest competitors is **ByteDance** which is the company behind Douyin / Tiktok\n   * [**TikTok has over 689 million monthly active users while Douyin has over 600 million,**](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/) and as we\u2019ve seen with WeChat, once you have the users, your opportunities to create additional businesses are endless\n   * In a sign of what may be to come, **ByteDance created a hit game** and may be starting to encroach upon Tencent\u2019s gaming dominance\n   * That said, Bytedance has a long way to go, having earned just $42 million with its top game vs. hundreds of millions for Tencent and **previous game launches have been unsuccessful**\n* **Reason #4 - Tencent trades in the US as a Level 1 ADR**\n   * [**Level 1 ADRs trade on OTC markets**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/what-are-differences-between-levels-i-ii-and-iii-american-depository-receipts-adrs.asp) and don\u2019t need to abide by GAAP accounting which result in less reliability and transparency\n   * I don\u2019t think that Tencent would commit accounting fraud given that the company is so large now but they are operating with some looser standards and this is something to keep in mind\n   * There was also some talk about the US delisting Chinese ADRs so again, this is another risk\n\n**Financials &amp; Valuation**\n\n* Starting off with the [financials](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21CorporateOverview.pdf)\u00a0(refer to this link for the datapoints I reference below), Tencent is a highly profitable business with an adjusted EBITDA margin that has hovered around 40% for the past few years which is extremely solid\n   * The company has just about as much cash as debt and normally you might want to see a larger cash position, but Tencent is generating so much in free cash flow that it really doesn\u2019t matter\n   * For instance, the company\u2019s debt to adjusted EBITDA is around 1.3x and for this ratio, about 6.0x is where you would get really worried about being\u00a0over leveraged and so Tencent is way below that\n* Regarding valuation, I\u2019ll be referring to this [table](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4FkTDhVoAAluTO?format=jpg&amp;name=large)\u00a0and comparing Tencent to its peers (trading comps)\n   * Amongst the\u00a0Chinese peers, we can see that **Tencent\u2019s revenue growth is in the\u00a0middle of the pack** but its **profitability numbers** aka its EBITDA margin, profit margin, and free cash flow yield **lead the pack**\n   * This along with Tencent\u2019s competitive moat and impressive investment portfolio is probably why **Tencent is trading at a premium versus its Chinese peers**\n   * **Amongst the U.S. peers,** we see that **Tencent is growing the fastest in revenue while is more in the middle of the pack for profitability**\n   * You can also see that Tencent is in the middle of the pack when it comes to multiples vs. its U.S. peers meaning that **Tencent is not cheap vs. its U.S. peers either**\n* Based on all this I think Tencent is an amazing business with a nearly impenetrable moat in various industries, but there are a lot of risks investing in Chinese companies, so I\u2019d want to invest in companies that are a bit more discounted so I can have a higher margin of safety\n* **Tencent is not the cheapest company vs. its Chinese peers nor its U.S. peers** and so for me, I would want to see Tencent trading at much lower multiples before I invest, probably somewhere around 15x 2022 EBITDA (loosely speaking)\n   * This is because I could simply invest in U.S. companies at a better valuation while not taking on the risks that come with investing in Chinese companies\n   * That said, if you believe that China will vastly outgrow U.S. companies and are not as sensitive to the risks with Chinese stocks, Tencent\u2019s moat may be enough to warrant an investment with a long-term time horizon\n\n**TLDR:** Tencent with WeChat, its gaming business, and investment portfolio has an incredible moat. That said, the company is not trading cheaply and so personally I would wait for the price to come down a bit before investing. That said, I welcome all counter points and it\u2019d be great to hear your thoughts.",

It has had some fantastic growth over the years, but its share price is currently stagnant.\n\nI am a believer that when a company gets negative press for a sustained period, the market overreacts, and price opportunities occur.\n\nI did the exact same post on FB a few months back before it recovered \ud83d\ude0a \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lj7ig4/fb\\_facebook\\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lj7ig4/fb_facebook_undervalued/) \n\n  \n\n**Company Performance**\n\nRevenue growth has been exceptional\n\nYear\tRevenue\tGrowth\n\n2021\t717,289,000\t40.72%\n\n2020\t509,711,000\t35.26%\n\n2019\t376,844,000\t50.58%\n\n2018\t250,266,000\t \n\n(CCY = CNY &amp; Year End = 31.03.YY)\n\n**Average Revenue growth 3 years** = 42%    (FB: 29%, MSFT:14%, GOOG: 18%, APPL: 6%)\n\n**P.E** = 24.92   (FB: 28.17  AZN: 61.32  TENCENT: 27.08  APPL: 28.01)\n\n**Market Cap** \\- $579bn\n\n**Net Equity** \\- $165bn (55bn of which is cash)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Share Price**\n\nDown 32% from its high point last October\n\nDown 21% since mid-Feb\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Market Consensus**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/analysis?p=BABA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/analysis?p=BABA)\n\nThe overwhelming majority of analysts consider it a buy \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Concerns** \n\n\\- China is a disaster when it comes to controlling its citizens, unfortunately, Jack Ma is no exception. \n\n\\- Alibaba is a massive company and constant government focus/fines will most likely stunt future growth. \n\n  \\- I do not understand the Chinese economy and probably never will. This makes it almost impossible to predict future demand-side headwinds. \n\nFinally, I want to apologise for how short this is, I am lazy. Also, this is not financial advice only my opinion.",

        "selftext": "Banks and fintech companies make money from people opening accounts with them - and so for them to grow, people need to be googling them.

With that in mind I think the best estimate would be to just average these five valuations, which is \\~66B. That would be well over triple the current valuation.\n\n**My Positions**\n\n07/16/21 50C\n\n07/09/21 25C",

        "selftext": " I\u2019m going to try to keep this as unbiased as possible, and we\u2019ll leave the overhyping to the apes. A few disclaimers: I\u2019m a CPA in training with a Master\u2019s in Accounting from Bentley University, so I do thoroughly know how to read and interpret financial statements, and can layer in some technical/ratio analysis to back my opinions.\n\nI am fairly new to trading but am good at picking up chart trends and understanding how the bigger picture affects the daily stock price. With that said I\u2019m still very much a newbie on valuations and the market as a whole. The other disclaimer is that I currently hold 12.5% of my portfolio in RKT and am considering 1.5-2x that position in the coming days.\n\nAllow me to first talk about the market conditions, then the health of the company itself, and then I will move to the stock.\n\nI\u2019ve been very torn about what to write in this part of my DD. A lot of people are wary of rising interest rates and decreasing demand in the future of the US housing market. While these woes are valid, I believe the Fed understands we are still far off from a full recovery. COVID-19 is still very prevalent across the globe, which will continue to put bottlenecks in supply chains and stretch out the full recovery. Investors are also short-sighted, so when RKT reported in their recent earnings that their GOS margin (gain-on-sale) will be lower than it was over the recent year, the stock tumbled.\n\nThis makes logical sense that it will be lower in the future, though, because we are coming out of a period of historical demand for mortgages and refinancing. Rocket even lays this out in their report, stating that their strong earnings over the last year clearly demonstrates how well-positioned they are in the market. With RKT diversifying its offerings (mentioned below), and the Fed unlikely to raise rates until at least late FY21-early FY22, these market woes don\u2019t deter me from my bullishness.\n\nFundamentally RKT is an extremely strong company for a myriad of reasons (strap in). Quicken Loans/Rocket Mortgage is the largest non-bank retail lender in the country by a massive margin, more than 2x larger than the second (United Shore Financial). Non-bank lenders can offer more flexible loans than banks with lower down payment percentages. While bigger is not always better, one should simply look to a company\u2019s customers and employees to determine long-term viability and market share retention/growth. Rocket Mortgage has been named #1 in the U.S. for Client Satisfaction in Mortgage Origination by JD Power for 11 years in a row, boasting a 91% customer retention rate and ranked 194 on the recent Fortune 500 list. Fortune ranks Rocket as #5 in their list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. They also offer employee discounts on mortgages which is an awesome perk.\n\nThe company is quite robust financially. $RKT brings a portfolio of offerings that give it huge competitive advantages, as well as a seemingly healthy balance sheet with increasing operating margins during a time where home ownership is at an all-time high (and average home prices have appreciated 3% YoY). Dan Gilbert, Rocket\u2019s cofounder and chairman, still owns 75%+ of the company, despite starting the company in 1985. He recently became the 36 th richest person in the world after Rocket\u2019s IPO. Together with the CEO Jay Farner, they\u2019ve kept Rocket/Quicken on the cutting edge of new technology: the company is investing heavily in new platforms to streamline the lending process and provide a full- service suite of products to their clients. Notably they reported a 220% increase (to 45,000 agents nationwide) in adoption of their Rocket Pro Insight platform which provides real estate agents with realtime updates on the status of their clients\u2019 mortgages and allows them to assist along the way.\n\nThey offer Rocket Auto \u2013 an automotive retail marketplace that pulled down $360 million in gross merchandise revenue for Q1. Amrock, an insurance services, property valuation, and settlement services company, just had its best quarter in history, with closings up 110% from last year. And RocketHomes.com, a fully integrated home search website, which had a mind-boggling increase of 300% to 1.5 million unique monthly visitors. Needless to say, this is a company that is operationally sound, growing exponentially with massive resources, loved by its customers, and takes care of its employees.\n\nThe company is focusing on growing its other revenue streams, building out its platforms, and grabbing more market share in an industry where it\u2019s already dominating. There are plenty of press releases and news articles out about Rocket which is also a positive in my eyes, as I value transparency. I also like that they are a company that advertises a lot and has key partnerships and sponsorships as this further builds brand reputation. Switching gears to the actual RKT stock itself and valuation.\n\nThere are a myriad of reasons the stock is where it\u2019s at today which I\u2019ll try to touch on, but in the last week I finally \u201cgot\u201d it looking at the price action and putting the pieces together. It\u2019s here that I\u2019ll say I\u2019m torn on the cost/benefit of RKT being a \u201cmeme\u201d stock as it can lead to overselling/shorts piling on which we\u2019ve seen, but during current shifting bullish market conditions back towards small cap growth I do see this as a benefit. Again this is where brand reputation/name recognition helps immensely as it already has huge retail interest.\n\nThe primary reason I believe RKT to be undervalued at $20, other than what I\u2019ve mentioned previously, is the possibility of an addition of RKT to the S&amp;P 500, and the recent addition to the Russell 1000 index. I won\u2019t get into why this is be a massive deal for the stock, but I will discuss what brought RKT to this point. To be in the S&amp;P a company needs to be US-based with market cap of $10B+, post 4 straight profitable quarters, and have 10%+ of public float. Basically RKT has \\~8% of its total company in Class A shares available to the public which has 100% of the economic interest, and the other \\~92% in Class D shares with more voting power but no economic interest, the vast majority of which Dan Gilbert owns and the rest for institutional investors and employees (seeing rumors of Hathaway buying a stake as Gilbert and Buffett are amigos, not confirmed). It\u2019s TOTAL market cap is around $38B, with the publicly traded shares valued around $3B. Unfortunately, I have read that S&amp;P will not allow new companies with more than 1 class of stock. Gilbert could convert all of the class D shares into class A to meet the S&amp;P\u2019s criteria.\n\nIn my opinion, choosing to keep RKT structured as-is has proven beneficial as Gilbert and management have kept \\~70% of the voting rights because they believe they know how to steer the company best. So far this has worked quite well for them, as you don\u2019t become the 36 th richest person in the world with an industry-leading company without steering through some tough waters. TLDR I\u2019m fine with them not going in the S&amp;P, but even being added to the Russell is a very bullish sign.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$RKT Daily](https://preview.redd.it/kon8hv7mcg471.jpg?width=1812&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87736b6042af9551455b9faec2f11d2de5131c9e)\n\nThe stock has struggled to break the 50 MA but is recently coming off a breakout from the 10 MA on volume and \u201crenewed retail interest in meme stocks\u201d. In its short history the stock has traded mostly in this $19-24 channel but has tried and failed to breakout and hold multiple times.\n\nAt the most recent date I could find, RKT had a short interest of about 20 million shares out of 136 million outstanding, a 100% increase from the prior reported date. Also notice that nice cup and handle forming with solid support at $19.50, and a recent breakout in the last 2 days. I will admit I have NO idea what Rocket should be \u201cworth\u201d but based on its multiples it seems grossly undervalued at $20-22.\n\nIf you believe the company can continue even coming close to these growth metrics it\u2019s trading under 10x forward P/E, which seems low for any industry, especially with the recent index rebalance of value/growth stocks. Now more anecdotally\u2026\n\nI have read and heard of MANY bag holders of RKT when it was trading in its higher range and can confirm by looking at the option chain that there is far more open interest in ITM calls vs ITM puts, indicating that options traders are more bullish than bearish.\n\nI believe investors don\u2019t fully understand what a quality company they have on their hands, with retail volatility in full effect and the shorts piling on to scare away the bulls creating heavy selling pressure. Bears clearly are wary of an over-inflated housing market and rising interest rates which will hurt their profitability, but I believe financially RKT will weather any such storm due to their market share and continued push towards revenue diversification.\n\n**\\*This is not financial advice and simply my own opinions.**",

        "selftext": "# GM - Bullish - Neutral - Aug. 4th Earnings Runup \n\n# News Catalyst\n\n***GM To Increase Vehicle Deliveries To Customers In U.S., Canada - PR Newswire***\n\n\"Today, General Motors outlined steps it is taking to increase deliveries to dealers and customers in the United States and Canada to meet strong consumer demand for Chevrolet, Buick , GMC and Cadillac vehicles.\n\nAs announced in May, GM will return full-size pickup production to Oshawa Assembly in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2021. The new accelerated timeline and incremental volume are expected to make an impact in 2022, as production ramps up.\n\nAs a result of GM's ongoing efforts to prioritize semiconductor usage, its success engineering solutions that maximize the utilization of chips as well as the pull-ahead of some projected semiconductor deliveries into the second quarter, the company now expects its first-half financial results to be significantly better than the first-half guidance previously provided.  GM is optimistic about the full year and expects to share additional information during its second-quarter earnings conference call on Aug. 4.  GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra and Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson will also participate in a Virtual Fireside Chat with Credit Suisse  today, beginning at 1 p.m. EDT ...\"  \n\n***GM Lifts Forecast As Chip Shortage Eases, Stock Hits Record - Associated Press***\n\n\"...Made engineering changes, prioritized semiconductor use and pulled some potential deliveries into the second quarter. So now the first-half earnings will be significantly better than forecasts it issued earlier in the year.\n\nGM had predicted a first-half pretax profit of around $5.5 billion when it released first-quarter earnings in May. The company also said it's optimistic about the full year, but gave no further details.\n\nGM previously forecast a full-year pretax profit of $10 billion to $11 billion and said earnings would be at the high end of the range.

        "selftext": "Yes, you heard me, shroom boom is back baby. And it will take you to the moon. Obligatory, I\u2019m not a financial advisor and this is not an advice. In fact, I know very little about shrooms and I can\u2019t do day trading as I\u2019m tied up with work usually.\n\nNow, this might be a long game. I\u2019m in it at least for another several months with 100 stock positions. Options are not for the faint of heart as this may go back down before it hits ATH later in the year.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the company. From the interwebs: \u201cCOMPASS Pathways operates as a mental health care company in the United Kingdom and the United States. It develops COMP360, a psilocybin formulation that is in **Phase IIb clinical trial** to treat patients with treatment-resistant depression.\u201d COMP360 received the highly-valuable **FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation.** It has extensive clinical trial pipeline with 21 sites in 10 countries and partners, including King's College London, Stanford University, and more.\n\nThis is so exciting, innit? But wait for the management and partnerships. You\u2019ll lick your chops. Make no mistake, this is not some back-alley, medicating-mind company where founders are using it as a front to get high CMPS is backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, and arguably the top biotech investor, Joseph Edelman at Perceptive Advisors. They absolutely have some of the most extensive collection of the giants in the pharmaceutical development and regulation domains. And on top of these, it has Shark Tank\u2019s Kevin O\u2019Leary as a spokesman. Mr. Wonderful has been drumming it up for the last couple of months and it you don\u2019t trust him, then you\u2019re dead to me.\n\nThey're making it known that they're not just a company riding on the hype, but that they are a collection of passionate and world-renowned experts that will drive innovation and advances in the realm of mental healthcare.  They have a solid patent implementation strategy. Just the patents worth billions if it all plays out well.\n\nWhat about the financials, you say. There you go: In September 2020, during Compass's IPO, the offering's total gross proceeds were **$146.6 million**. They have a very health cash at hand, and they expect this to continue to fund all operations into 2023. It's interesting to note that Compass has more cash on hand than all other psychedelic companies combined.  Like many other biotech clinical-stage companies, they are generating $0 in revenue.\n\nCurrently, Compass has a market cap of **$1.5B**. Their main market is depression and a side track of ADD. The bulk of depressive episodes (either major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar) are considered MDD, which are experienced by more than 13 million people in the US annually. TRD is broadly represented by patients who have MDD but don't respond satisfactorily to adequate treatment, but there is no exact definition. It is estimated to make up around 70% of the 13 million people suffering from MDD. That\u2019s a huge market. Based on the growth estimates, I saw someone on  made a valuation aver **$700B**, which sounds like absolute cockamamy. But who knows, maybe that\u2019s the way. I\u2019m bullish but not that much. It\u2019ll probably be gobbled up by a big pharma well before it reaches there.\n\n***What do I expect from the stock: It established a baseline around $34 with a resistance around $40. Parabolic rise is definitely a possibility, if it breaks, but more likely will take time to reach it\u2019s ATH of $60.***\n\nIt closed over it\u2019s 200 day MA, so the trend is upwards and it\u2019s likely to continue till a new ATH. That\u2019s what I\u2019m betting on anyways. This is a casino so you do your own DD and bugger-off.",

        "selftext": "I was looking for Chinese stocks that would pay decent dividends (at least 2-3%), however, I cannot find any?\nI am wondering if the VIE structure has anything to do with that. If we buy BABA, NIO, TCEHY or whatever else, we don\u2019t get any actual ownership. \n\nAFAIK VIE works like the following. Chinese laws forbid foreigners from owning Chinese stocks. So the Chinese stock you buy actually only grants you a stake in some Cayman Islands-registered entity. These entities are under contracts to receive some profits from the Chinese assets but not to actually own them. This is how BABA, NIO, XPEV or whatever else Chinese works like. Besides, VIE technically is illegal but China has been silent on that.(more on the VIE structure https://globescancapital.com/chinese-vie-structure-wall-street-continues-to-ignore-the-risks/)\n\nAside from all the political risks, I am wondering - if a Chinese company no longer needs to raise capital in the West, why would it keep the obligation to share profits with the shareholders? If the VIE structure is not enforceable, the shareholders of the Cayman Island companies (again: BABA, XPEV, NIO) could end up with empty bags while the profits would go to CEO/board/Chinese shareholders.\n\nAlso given that shareholders are not entitled to any ACTUAL entity in the Chinese company, the board/CEO can decide to simply transfer ownership of the company\u2019s assets to somewhere else thus leaving shareholders emptyhanded and thus NIO, BABA and whatever else could easily go to 0 while the actual companies may thrive.\n\nAnd this can harm not only retail. There was this dispute between Yahoo and Alibaba when Jack Ma transfered ownership of Alipay from the group to an entity controlled by himself and didn\u2019t even inform other shareholders.(https://www.ft.com/content/40a66dd2-b9ec-11e0-8171-00144feabdc0)\n\nSo if the Chinese companies trading under VIE structure don\u2019t pay out their profits (technically the sole reason for the VIE structure), it looks like they should be bought only for speculation purposes.\n\nAre there any Chinese well established companies that share their profits and pay decent dividends to their VIE shareholders?",

        "selftext": "Video summary of the below: [https://youtu.be/Fuo-CpCo0LQ](https://youtu.be/Fuo-CpCo0LQ)\n\n# What is Corsair?\n\nCorsair is a gaming company which has recently gained a lot of popularity because of Wallstreetbets and rightfully so, in my opinion. They sell computer peripherals, gaming and studio accessories, custom-made PCs, components, services and so on, effectively offering customers a one-stop shop for anything related to computer hardware, gaming software and other computer services. The company believes that they can address a market size of up to $46B or about 24 times larger than their current market share of $1.9B and they are expanding rapidly to make this happen. Over the last 12 months, Corsair acquired 3 new companies and launched 84 new products while showing a 47% growth in revenue in the latest quarter as compared to last year, 104% growth in gross profit and a staggering 197% growth in adjusted EBITDA! So, how are they achieving this massive growth?\u00a0Essentially, Corsair is trying to tap two of the fastest growing markets right now, gaming and eSports, plus digital content creation\u00a0which can be seen in their two main revenue streams: Gaming Component and Systems, and Gamer and Creator Peripherals which were split relatively evenly last quarter in terms of sales.\u00a0\n\nCorsair is using the growth in the eSports market which is estimated to grow 11% annually over the next 5 years to kickstart their own growth. If you think about it, all of those millennials that grew up playing games are now able to afford specialised gaming gear which is what Corsair is offering. We're also seeing a big number of Generation Z entering the labour market and being able to afford more expensive gaming gear. Gaming and esports have already become mainstream with professional gamers earning serious cash and rivalling mainstream sport athletes in earnings so we can tell that this is just the beginning of it.\n\nThe digital content creation market is also growing at an annual rate of 13% across the board. YouTube, Twitch and other video, streaming and podcasting platforms are experiencing a massive surge in both creators and users.\u00a0Corsair wants to use to this to drive their sales using\u00a0their Creator Peripherals products. Working from home has also led a lot of people to improve their home offices and that trend is here to stay, which provides even more opportunities for Corsair to tap into yet another growing market.\n\nFinally, the company wants to convert existing customers into loyal customers that come back to buy again and again and again. To do that, they are driving engagement through social media and they currently have a combined following of over 20mln across 4 different social media websites, plus they are represented by over 800 different influencers with a reach of over 1.3B people! They also offer customisation and personalisation in their products, they are focusing to be the\u00a0best-in-class hardware and on selling solutions, services and software that will cater to the needs of gamers and creators.\u00a0\u00a0Customer retention is always a winning strategy for companies when it comes down to optimising earnings and it is good to see that Corsair is focusing on it although I would also like them to start sharing some KPIs that track this.\u00a0\n\n# Bullish Thesis\n\nBefore I go into my bullish thesis, I want to point out that the current stock price that I am looking at is $36. Alright, so, the company doesn't really have any strong rivals in my opinion which is a strong bullish argument.\u00a0There is Pegatron, but the company has suffered a lot over the last year due to labor violations. Another is Razer, but they haven't shown a lot of promise over the last year either.\u00a0The closest rival is probably Logitech, but their business model and strategy are much different than Corsair's and I think that Corsair has a much better positioning to tap into the growing markets. Still, both Logitech and Corsair have performed amazingly over the last 12 months although I see Corsair as having a much better potential for growth. Right now, it is only a seventh of the size of Logitech with a $3.3B market cap versus Logitech's $21.7B although Corsair's revenue is less than 3 times smaller than Logitech's with a $1.9B vs $5.2B in revenue. Their Price-to-Sales ratio is 1.74 for Corsair and 4.14 for Logitech so we can see that Corsair is actually undervalued in terms of sales. The main reason why Corsair is lagging behind is their net income which is still relatively low, but as I mentioned earlier in this video, their growth is supercharged and off the charts. Plus, this is completely understandable for a company that is in its early growth phase. Another bullish argument is the fact that\u00a0a lot of hedge funds and institutions are betting AGAINST Corsair which gives us the opportunity for a short squeeze! About 18% of Corsair's share float is shorted, which is extremely high and completely unjustified in my opinion! The company is performing extremely well and they are trading at a low price. Their forward PE is only 17.9 which is tiny for a growth company as opposed to Logitech's forward PE of 27! Plus, Corsair absolutely CRUSHED their latest earnings, beating earnings per share by $0.25 or about 75%. They also beat their revenue estimate by $76M or almost 17% AND, to top it all of,\u00a0they raised their guidance, but the price still dropped! Analysts keep revising their earnings estimates up, which is yet another bullish signal. Plus, Corsair has enough current assets to cover their current liabilities and has a low debt so financial health is not really a problem. They have one Venture Capital fund, EagleTree Capital, hold 62% of the company and insiders hold another 4% which gives us a massive, absolutely massive opportunity for price growth especially when we look at their tiny market cap! I honestly think that Corsair can easily double in price and still be a relatively good purchase. The company is that good. Finbox's DCF model currently gives us a 43% upside with a target price of $51.5 and SimplyWallstreet's DCF model gives us a fair value of $80.3, a 123% upside so we can see that there are some decent bullish arguments behind Corsair.\u00a0However you look at it, Corsair is a beast of a company and an absolute bargain.\u00a0\n\nThere is no point in technical analysis right now. WSB boosted the stock and distorted all the signals. The only thing that's worth looking at is the 50D MA which is currently around $32-$33 and whether it will act as support for the current price. We can reasonably expect $40-$42 to serve as a resistance at this point.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nHonestly, out of all the companies that I've been researching recently, this one looks the most promising. Corsair is one of my biggest holdings right now and I will just keep adding to it.",

        "selftext": "Reviewing the Bear Case on Paysafe (PSFE)\n\nJP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently noted that fintechs pose \"enormous competitive threats\" to banks and SF Federal Reserve board member, Jackie Reses, sees them \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d with \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of \u201ca $16 trillion market cap\u201d.\n\nIn this context, fintech Paysafe (PSFE) is newly listed on the NYSE and introduced to the US market. Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCommon bear arguments:\n\n\\#1 Old business\n\n\\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat\n\n\\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult\n\n\\#4 No growth\n\n\\#5 Slow growth\n\n\\#6 Not profitable\n\n\\#7 Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.\n\n\\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell\n\n\\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#1) Old business. \n\nPaysafe\u2019s extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nMuch of Paysafe\u2019s business is in back-end payment processing so most don\u2019t even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)\n\nIn Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.\n\nPaysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They\u2019ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nAside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service.\u00a0\n\nIn preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.\n\nAs Chairman Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab\u2026I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet\u2026 It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. \n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe\u2019s Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,\u201ca fortress. It\u2019s got a moat\u2026 We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion \"unbanked\" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors\n\nFrom SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: \u201cTo be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be a winner in this space, you\u2019re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That\u2019s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we\u2019ve entered.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. \n\nSynergistic inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a key pillar of Paysafe\u2019s forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d (2, 4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#4) No growth. \n\nIt\u2019s true that Paysafe\u2019s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:\n\n2017: $864 million rev\n\n2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)\n\n2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).\n\n2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)\n\nUnlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, \u201cexited low value referral channels\u201d and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.\n\nLooking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:\n\n\u2014Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)\n\n\u2014 Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)\n\nNot claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#5) Slow growth. \n\nGoing forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&amp;A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe\u2019s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d\n\nIn the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:\n\n1 \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n\n2 \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n\n3 New Hampshire: \"Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n\n4 \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n\n5 \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n\n6 \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n\n7 \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n\n8 \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n\n9 \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n\n10 \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n\n11 \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n\n12 \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n\n13 \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n\n14 \"Single-sports betting in Canada wins House vote, nears legalization\"\n\n15 \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n\n16 \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (not far from Paysafe\u2019s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter eliminating outliers with highest multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n\n2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.\n\n3 As noted Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.\n\n4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon\u2019s \"enormous competitive threats\" comment.\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers projects roughly 20% more growth than Paysafe yet trades at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#6) Not profitable. \n\nPaysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, \u201cPaysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company\u2019s projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.\u201d\nThese fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:\n\nRepay: -0.67,\n\nAffirm : -2.18,\n\nNuvei : -1.08,\n\nPaysign : -0.19.\n\nBill : -0.62,\n\nShift4 : -0.43\n\nAverage EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69\nIf you read their transcripts and presentations, you\u2019ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They\u2019ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&amp;A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#7) Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.   \nPaysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d\n\nTheir 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: \u201cDebt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.\u201d \n\nOf the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:\n\nSquare: 77.8X\n\nRepay : 8.7X\n\nFiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X\n\nGPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X\n\nShift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA\n\nAffirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA\n\nPaysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA\n\nBill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA\n\nDepending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe\u2019s share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they\u2019ll be able to fund M&amp;A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. \n\nThe common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it\u2019s more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.\n\nImportantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley\u2019s time-tested M&amp;A playbook.\n\nBlackstone itself says (9), \u201cThe term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.\u201d With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?\n\nBlackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: \u201cWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview Foley said, private equity\u2019s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d\n\nThis trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: \u201cCommitment of Paysafe\u2019s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders\u2019 belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.\u201d\n\nThe PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand both his M&amp;A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the \u201cThe Foley Network\u201d (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity\u2019s massive transactional volume). \nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, \u201cThe thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBesides, just as large funds will often drive price down to accumulate large positions, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and will do so via off-market trades to avoid price slippage. Therefore, we probably wouldn\u2019t even notice profit taking until after quarterly filings. Paysafe\u2019s fundamental value in context indicates such prospects present very little long term risk, especially from current price levels. Given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square\u2019s), once audited numbers are available, many large funds focused on this space will necessarily seek a more balanced exposure through Paysafe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. \n\nAccording to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.\n\nImportantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.\n\nTotal FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 %\u00a0\n\nBlackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 %\u00a0\n\nCVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 %\u00a0\n\nOther Pre-Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53,701,074 7.4 %\u00a0\n\nCannae (excluding amounts included in Founder) 50,000,000 6.9 %\u00a0\n\nPIPE Investors (excluding Cannae) 165,000,000 22.8 %\u00a0\n\n723,734,536 100.0 %\u00a0\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements (25% to 100% upon ticker change without any prior notice), to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays (7+ trading days) in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms, to things in the media that this sub will not allow to be discussed.  In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of \u201cfake sell walls\u201d and HFS \u201cshort ladder attacks\u201d as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. \n\nI think Paysafe is currently undervalued and, as the developments in legalized sports betting come to fruition, it is very likely a 3X from here. M&amp;A plans already in the works will bring additional catalysts. Given Paysafe's healthy fundamentals, large market share in a fintech space known for \u201csticky\u201d customers, and exposure to high growth verticals like iGaming, it seems inevitable that large funds will seek to benefit from these low prices, especially once the first audited quarterly numbers are available on May 11th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Per their analyst presentation, here is Paysafe\u2019s minimum Q1 guidance to meet or beat:\n\n$360 million revenue\n\n$220 million gross profit\n\n$105 million EBITDA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I hold $600K in commons and warrants\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

SBC is highly involved and helping get NSAVs roots in Asia as well as helping NSAV facilitate deals.\n\nPress Releases\n\n**SBCDF**\n\n[NSAV acquires an additional 25% stake (50% total) in SBCDF (SilverBear Capital Decentralized Finance). SBCDF will launch its own crypto currency token; STUX](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/79936)\n\n**VirtuaBroker**\n\n[NSAV acquire a total 30% stake in cryptocurrency trading broker VirtuaBroker.](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/83473)  \nThis platform lets users trade between multiple crypto exchanges. It's said to be one of NSAV's best potential asset.

They also look to add additional features like AI cryptocurrency Trading Platform which will trade and backtest trades 24/7 for you.\n\nExchanges on this platform currently include:\n\n\\- Coinbase  \n\\- Bitfinex  \n\\- Binance  \n\\- KuCoin  \n\\- Bittrex  \n\\- HitBTC  \n\\- Poloniex  \n\\- Kraken\n\nHere is a timeline for the software release dates\n\n\\- 31March 2021: VirtuaBroker launches beta phase for users. - LAUNCHED ON TIME  \n\\- 31March 2021: Price Search &amp; Portfolio Management - LAUNCHED ON TIME -  \n30April 2021: Coin Discovery - LAUNCHED ON TIME  \n\\- 31May 2021: VirtuaBroker platform is available to all - LAUNCHED ON TIME  \n\\- 31May 2021: Manual Trading - LAUNCHED ON TIME  \n\\- 30June 2021: Mobile app platform is available to all  \n\\- 30June 2021: Coin Acquisition  \n\\- Third quarter of 2021: Portfolio Rebalancing, Social Trading  \n\\- Fourth quarter of 2021: Personal AI (Artificial Intelligence) Broker\n\n**RydeHails**\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MFvvnav1rcf5aFMtXF1DZZxq4ojdxcrg/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MFvvnav1rcf5aFMtXF1DZZxq4ojdxcrg/view)\n\nA crypto-based ride sharing start up that NSAV has acquired a 20% stake in. I could explain this one as well but the google drive PDF above should cover the basics of what the company is trying to achieve.\n\n**Virtual Asset Management Company**\n\nLetter of Intent (LOI) to acquire 40% stake in a virtual asset management company.\n\n[https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/86708](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/86708)\n\nCurrently the company is unnamed but this is viewed as a potential long term project and asset. It is a currently operating virtual asset management company and with the rise of crypto, crypto asset management is a field that will rise with it.\n\n\"The management of NSAV believes that given the increased regulation of Virtual Assets, asset management companies will increasingly be called upon to act as custodian of virtual assets, as blockchain technology becomes more and more prevalent in the business world. Virtual Asset clients will soon see the importance of storing their digital assets with regulated entities and licensed institutions for safe keeping. NSAV's cryptocurrency clients would no longer have to worry about losing or forgetting their password, which results in the loss of their entire Bitcoin or other virtual assets. Investors in Bitcoin alone, have lost over $140 billion as a result of lost passwords. The Company believes a \"Virtual Asset\" Asset cCManagement company will solve this problem.\n\nThe second reason the management of NSAV decided to strongly pursue this transaction, is that the Company believes a blockchain enabled Asset Management company can assist in allowing more transparency to the regulators, in order to protect investors against non-regulated activities. NSAV envisions becoming the bridge between the banking world, along with genuine cryptocurrency investors (i.e., introducing proper Crypto ETF products for investors to purchase), so crypto investor's bank accounts will not have to be frozen due to sub-standard crypto investments, which is a common occurrence in the industry at the moment.\"\n\nLastly, The Reason I Decided To Make This Post Now\n\nNSAV has been in negotiations for months over the acquisition of a stake in an existing cryptocurrency exchange. At the height of the recent cryptocurrency bubble, the exchange they were dealing with had a peak daily trading volume of $4 billion. The average daily trading volume then was somewhere within the range of $800 million to $2 billion.\n\nThese numbers are crazy, and considering the fees on buying and selling crypto, the exchange can be making anything from several hundred thousand dollars to even millions EACH DAY.\n\nAfter knowing the investment strategy of a holding company which typically holds minority stakes in other companies, the most recent twitter update from the CEO has confirmed that NSAV will own 100% of a cryptocurrency exchange. There is no confirmation as to which company this can be, or even if it is the same one as was mentioned months ago with the peak daily trading volume of $4 billion. However, Yuen Wong who has been involved with this company and it's projects is a managing partner of BitMart and many believe it could be that, however that is just speculation. However we can infer that SBC helped facilitate this deal as it can potentially be a company multiply NSAV's current market cap.\n\nIf this crypto exchange is the same one as was advertised months ago, one year of trading, plus a possible resurgence of the crypto market can see it pull in revenue exceeding its current market cap.\n\nThoughts on SBCs Involvement\n\nSilverBear Capital seems to have involved itself in NSAV more than most people thought they would. Over the past few months since it was announced they would be the investment banking firm supporting NSAV, they have added many partners and experienced members into top positions in the company. Many including myself think that SBC is trying to do a reverse take over of NSAV and use it as their crypto currency investing company.\n\nI don't think I've seen this level of investment in a OTC ticker from a multi-billion dollar wall street investment bank in a while or even ever. SBC has let them have 50% of a token they are trying to make. Companies that are acquired by NSAV in the future might also use this same token in their blockchain and crypto-ecosystem.\n\nConclusion/Slight TL;DR\n\nI've been following this company for half a year now and the promises they've made and deals they've let us know about are finally coming to fruition. Their whole plan is to hold stakes in many cryptocurrency companies and create their own crypto ecosystem. Obviously I'm very bullish in the long run for this company, but the latest news about acquiring 100% of a cryptocurrency exchange exceeded all expectations I had for this company. They mentioned that they have been in negotiations for this exchange for months so I believe it is pretty safe to say the little snippets of information about their daily trading volume from back in March refer to the already existing exchange they were trying to acquire a 10%-30% stake of.\n\nDo your own DD obviously, but for me, I see a bunch of promises that were made and promises that were kept (although it has taken a while they have come through on a lot of promises). And with the backing of SBC I would be very surprised if they failed. I don't think any multi-billion dollar wall street investment firm invests this much time and resources into a $44mm market cap penny stock for fun.",

        "selftext": "iTub is nearing an explosion.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe volume in the last 45 minutes of the day was HUGE. Like 10 million shares huge. In after-hours, two large-scale orders occurred one for 260,000 shares and one for 316,000 shares. \n\nAdditionally, the BRL just broke resistance against the USD. This is good news for iTub as it is a Brazilian bank and strength in the currency is strength for the bank. A lot of people (including me) are down significantly on 7/16 calls but, those who aren't in yet could get in at a great price. The volume is there, and they could have some news soon with the XP brokerage deal.\n\n**Technicals:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5f0xqvms5w671.jpg?width=1357&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d75137a86cd211f52b8d1abe07ab9722fba17461\n\nIn the long term, iTub is trading in a consistent upwards channel, which is why the short-term movement could be strong if we break that resistance around $6.65-$6.60. Also trading just below 200 MA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9cq1rtya6w671.jpg?width=759&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=358b4d561ec23830243db9c37af16dc31cc4d47c\n\nAdditionally, the 5-day chart shows clear bouncing between the $6.33 and $6.45 levels. iTub closed today at $6.45. \n\niTub is set up for the right move, a break out of the short-term $6.45 level would be great news for bulls. We would look again for a push above the $6.60-$6.65 level which is our long-term resistance. iTub has the attention and volume to achieve that now, especially with the breakout of the BRL. The stock price is still beat down from the crash, and with interest rates moving and Brazil recovering, this is a position I am comfortable in.\n\nPositions:\n\n357 7/16 8c\n\nTLDR: iTub",

        "selftext": "FTOC/Payoneer DD\n\n**Positions: FTOC shares, average price $13.24. Not financial advice.**\n\n**What is FTOC/Payoneer?**\n\nFtac Olympus Acquisition Corp (FTOC) is a SPAC led by Betsy Cohen that has a definitive agreement to merge with Payoneer.\n\nPayoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.\n\nPayoneer also offers:\n\n* Accounting integrations\n* Capital to small businesses\n* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure\n* Physical debit cards\n* Tax solutions\n\n**Management Team**\n\nScott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.\n\nMichael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.\n\nBetsy Cohen - CEO of FTOC. Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.\n\n**Customers**\n\nPayoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:\n\n* Amazon Europe\n* Google\n* eBay\n* Walmart\n* Upwork\n* Fiverr\n\nPayoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.\n\n**Switching Costs**\n\nIntegrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).\n\n**Brand**\n\nPayoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.\n\n**Network Effect**\n\nImagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.\n\n**Geographies**\n\nUNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.\n\nIf this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.\n\nSome evidence:\n\n* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.\n* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.\n\n**Valuation and Financials**\n\nAll numbers are based on original deal multiples (i.e based on when FTOC was $10 a share).\n\nEnterprise Value: $3.27 billion\n\nProjected 2021 revenue: $432 million\n\nEV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x\n\n2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%\n\nThis revenue growth is admittedly lower than one would desire for a FinTech company, and is often a criticism leveled against FTOC. However, considering the low EV/Revenue multiple (7.6x) compared to payment processing industry peers (36.5x), means the valuation more than compensates. Another FinTech going public through a SPAC, PaySafe, actually reported a 0.8% decrease in revenues from 2019-2020, but it recently hit $18 a share. (Nothing against PaySafe at all). Moreover, Payoneer\u2019s payment volume increased by 51% in the same timeframe, which will surely result in higher revenues in time. This should mean they reach their long-term target of yearly 20% revenue growth.\n\n**Institutional Ownership**\n\nPayoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n**Speculative Catalyst**\n\nIn ARK\u2019s Big Ideas 2021, FinTech was mentioned as a big theme that will prevail in 2021. If ARK were to add this cheap, promising FinTech firm to one of their funds, Payoneer will get the respect it deserves and will rocket upwards.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* There are many entrants in the payment processing industry, potentially driving down fees and increasing competition for customers\n* Revenue did not increase very much during 2020, despite a huge e-commerce boom\n* Big clients (which could be a large percentage of revenues) may drop Payoneer for some (hypothetical) reason\n\n**Personal Note**\n\nI use Payoneer as a contractor for Appen. I like it, it always has good customer service, quick payouts and low fees compared to other providers.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nBull Case: $26\n\nMain Case: $21\n\nBear Case: $16\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Just educated guesses.\n\nAs always DYOR, I have linked the investor presentation in the sources, 100% worth a read.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nPosting sources that have been posted before gets this post taken down, so unfortunately I can't add them. If anyone wants them, send me a DM and I will reply with them (but bear in mind I live in the UK regarding time zones).\n\nEdit: Added risks, completely forgot about them (sorry).",

The last thing we want to do is shut down the growth that we've worked fairly hard to have.\"\n\n### The JM Smucker Company\n\nIn JM Smucker's fourth-quarter, 2021 conference call on June 3, there were 10 mentions of inflation, and CEO Mark Smucker said the company would be raising prices to offset rising costs.\n\n\"Broad-based inflation is impacting many of the commodities, packaging materials, and transportation channels that are important to our business. We are mitigating the impacts through a combination of higher pricing inclusive of list price increases, reduced trade and net revenue optimization strategies, as well as continued cost management,\" Smucker said.\n\n### Stanley Black &amp; Decker\n\nIn Stanley Black &amp; Decker's first quarter 2021 earnings presentation on April 28, in a slide entitled \"Commodity Inflation Update,\" the company said steel, resin, base metals, electrical components, and batteries have pushed incremental inflation costs up for 2021 by $160 million vs. January guidance.\n\nThe slide showed Black &amp; Decker's plans to increase prices to offset costs.\n\n### Whirlpool\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance in April, Whirlpool's CFO Jim Peters said the company was seeing price increases and would pass the costs onto consumers.\n\n\"We took price increases in every region of the world, that range from 5% to 12%,\" Peters said. \"Those are driven by commodity cost increases, and it's something we have done historically.\"\n\nThe company said in its first-quarter conference call that the price increase actions \"will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.\"\n\n### Kimberly-Clark\n\nKimberly-Clark said it would be raising prices on products like Scott toilet paper and Huggies diapers by \"mid-to-high single digits\" in late March.\n\nThen, in the company's April 23 first-quarter earnings call, execs said they saw \"sharp rises in input costs.\"\n\nMichael Hsu, Kimberly-Clark's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company was \"moving rapidly, especially with selling price increases to offset commodity headwinds.\"\n\n### Honeywell\n\nHoneywell's CEO Darius Adamczyk announced that \"inflation is taking hold\" and affecting his business' bottom line in the company's first-quarter 2021 conference call on April 23.\n\nThe CEO said, \"there's no doubt about it. We knew it. We see it.\" Honeywell announced it would be \"quickly taking action\" on pricing to stay ahead of the problem.\n\n### The Clorox Company\n\nClorox's VP of Investor relations Lisah Burhan told investors in the company's third-quarter 2021 results on April 30 that the company has seen \"significant resin price inflation.\"\n\nIn order to \"manage those rising costs,\" Clorox announced \"pricing action\" effective in July. \"As we've mentioned, we'll manage inflationary pressures holistically using all the tools in our toolbox,\" Burhan said.\n\n### Procter &amp; Gamble\n\nProcter &amp; Gamble COO Jon Moeller told analysts in an April 20 earnings call that \"this is one of the bigger increases in commodity costs that we've seen over the period of time that I've been involved with this, which is a fairly long period of time.\"\n\nThe company said it will begin \"the process of implementing price increases on its Baby Care, Feminine Care, and Adult Incontinence product categories in the United States to offset a portion of the impact of rising commodity costs,\" noting that the \"exact amount of the price increase will vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid-to-high single-digit percentages and will go into effect in mid-September.\"\n\n### Coca-Cola\n\nIn mid-April, Coca-Cola's CEO James Quincey told CNBC's Sara Eisen on \"Squawk on the Street\" that the company would be increasing prices to offset rising costs.\n\n\"We are well-hedged in '21, but there's pressure built up for '22, and so there will have to be some price increases,\" Quincey said.\n\n\"We intend to manage those intelligently, thinking through the way we use package sizes and really optimize the price points for consumers,\" he added.\n\n### Reynolds Consumer Products\n\nReynolds Consumer Products revealed that a three-step price increase is already underway on some of its most popular products last month.\n\n\"Price increases have been implemented, and a second-round is underway, with plans for a third-round to be implemented in the third quarter,\" Michael Graham, Reynolds chief financial officer, said during the company's first-quarter earnings call on Ma",

        "selftext": "Hey Guys. my first DD on a stock.\n\nMost  of you have heard about JD. It provides online retail, online  marketplace, and marketing services in China and serves as the main  competitor for Alibaba.\n\nMuch like other stocks during tech sell off, JD.Com suffered massive blows. Its current PE ratio is 14 which is unheard in the common e-commerce space.\n\nAlso,  JD stock has come down in anticipation of anti-trust crackdown of  chinese tech companies by chinese government. As we all know, this  started because Jack Ma could not keep his mouth shut and publicly said  that China rules are not every conducive for growth. As a result,  Government decided to make an example of tech companies and imposed them  with fines and maximum was imposed on BABA (4%).  No fines were levied  on JD.\n\nJD got penalized with other  stocks. Also, JD.com\u2019s 618 (June 18th) sales event is going very well   after selling $136 billion worth of goods last year helped fuel the   growth rally. 618 is JD.com\u2019s response to Alibaba\u2019s November Singles Day   event. A strong 618 event should be good for Walmart  which owns 5.39%  of the company and has historically promoted its goods on 618.\n\nIn  the first quarter, the Beijing-based company reported net revenue  of  203.2 billion yuan in the quarter ended March 31, an increase of 39%   year-on-year. Excluding items, JD.com posted a profit of 2.47 yuan per   American depository share (ADS), beating analysts\u2019 expectations of 2.26   yuan by 9.2%.\n\nThis is not new  territory for the company. On Mar. 11, JD.com  reported its  fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings. In that  earnings release,  the company highlighted that it grew its active user  base by nearly  one-third in a single year and increased revenue and EPS  by 31.4% and  187.5%, respectively.\n\nDespite this awesome performance, the company is trading at a steep discount to its 52-week high.\n\nOverall, I am very positive on the stock and its trading at good discount. I am long on the stock.\n\nI am not financial advisor. Please do your own research too. I am just an APE with a dream.",

Disclaimer: I went long yesterday at 12.20.\n\nOn the daily chart, PSFE went into over sold territory on may 13, it looks like it bottomed out at 10 dollars.  That's the first trigger I was looking for to keep an eye on the stock.  It was just rejected on the RED MA, but it needs to clear the blue which is at 13.5 for the real party to start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[5 min chart](https://preview.redd.it/icrtal6ow9871.png?width=1783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6f569c25adaeb9a11289439730f3ad097a86bf9)\n\nOn the 5 min chart, it has cleared the pink and the purple MAs which tell me momentum has shifted to the up side which is what triggered my entry.  Currently, based on the elliot wave principle we are in corrective WAVE 2, which is forming up to be a side ways ABCDE wave.  A close above the 13 dollar price would put us into wave 3 which matches with the daily chart needing to close above 13.5.  For those who are into the elliot wave principle wave 3 tends to be the largest wave.\n\nTL:DR PSFE has been dropping for 6 months now, finally entering oversold territory.  Its best to go long here and hold till it reaches over bought territory then take profit.",

        "selftext": "# Price\n\nFacebook currently trades at around $330. Its latest support is at around $296 to $300 and its latest resistance is actually around $330 so essentially the price that it's trading for right now. This is a crucial moment. If it manages to break $330, then we can see an upward movement going up to $360 which is the high ceiling of this channel that it has started forming. If you haven't invested yet, it could be a good time to wait for a couple of days or a week to see how its price will evolve. I have a feeling that it will start consolidating or it could slowly drop down to $315 or, worst case scenario, $300. It is currently trading above its 50D MA and its Relative Strength Index is near the top, but the volume is relatively low which makes me think that we probably won't see a lot of movement in the next week or two. However, as I said, I think that there is a good chance that we can see Facebook hitting $360 in a few months and maybe even $400 by the end of the year. Why? Well, Facebook has been delivering great results after great results. The fundamental performance of the company has been amazing so far. Absolutely amazing! In fact, out of ALL of its 20 earnings reports since 2016, it has only missed 1 and that was by 1 cent and it has only missed revenue ***twice***! The company outperforms analyst expectations and by a big margin, especially in the last 4 quarters. Last quarter, it beat analyst earnings expectations by 41%! This is massive! Especially for a company of Facebook's size! Essentially, what we are seeing is the pandemic boost in advertising that Facebook received was not as transitory as analysts expected. Also, there has been nothing but upward revisions for Facebook's Full Year 2021 earnings, which is a very good sign. 39 upward revisions in total! There have also been 23 upward earnings revisions for next quarter's earnings, which is almost always a good sign. Also, out of the 51 analyst covering Facebook in May, 45 have had a Buy or a Strong Buy rating!\n\n# The Business\n\nHowever, let's leave analyst opinions aside for the moment. They are good to gauge Wall Street's appetite for the company, but let's look at the business, at the fundamentals. Is Facebook really a good company? Facebook's main source of revenue are the ***advertising revenues that*** come from ads on its products, the Facebook app and website, Instagram, Whatsapp and Messenger. By gathering user data, Facebook is able to offer targeted ads which are obviously more expensive, but are also more attractive to advertisers. Even though regulators have reduced the amount of data that Facebook can gather and therefore reduced its ability to target specific audiences through its ads, the company has still managed to grow its advertising business by a LOT! Another reason why the company has done so well is because it operates the 7th most website in the world, Facebook, which is also the 2nd most visited social media website behind YouTube. Instagram is extremely popular as well, ranking in the 23rd place! As of the latest quarter, the Daily active users of Facebook's family of products are 2.72 BILLION with the number of monthly active users being 3.45 BILLION or more than 10 times the population of the US! This is literally half of the world's population! Facebook is still seeing growth in user numbers with its total user base up 15% year-on-year which is actually faster than last year's increase of 11%. So, we can see that their user base is growing, but is that translating into higher revenues? The answer: yes! In 2020, Facebook reported a 20% year-on-year advertising revenue increase, but in their last quarter alone, the advertising revenue increase was 46% compared to last year! Advertising makes about 98% of Facebook's revenue so we can see that the company is getting a serious boost in overall profits. Their net income also grew by 58% in 2020 year-on-year and an astonishing 94% in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to last year! Essentially, we can see that Facebook is reporting some serious growth for a megacap company and it is largely due to the increase in their advertising business. However, Facebook are also involved in Virtual and Augmented Reality through their Reality Labs. While this side of Facebook is still tiny, it is reporting a serious growth in revenues as well. In the first quarter of 2021, its revenue grew by almost 150% as compared to last year and now makes up 2.7% of Facebook's revenue! VR and AR are still relatively young industries, but they are growing fast as we can see. Market researchers claim that the industry will grow at an annual rate of 42% from $37B in 2019 to an astonishing $1.27T in 2030! Facebook is one of the leaders in this space along with Apple, Microsoft and Samsung so this represents a massive opportunity for the tech giant and yet another solid bullish argument for Facebook. Unlike its competitors, Facebook's business is relatively concentrated so I think this gives the company a competitive advantage when it comes to growing its VR and AR business. The company has also grown its headcount by 30% in 2020 so we can see that it is doubling down on expansion and growth. Despite that, analysts are only expecting a revenue and earnings growth of about 15% annually for the next 3 years. To some extent, that is justified as Facebook did get a big bump in earnings due to COVID. However, I think that their estimates lean towards the conservative side and I think that Facebook can actually achieve a growth of between 20% and 25%, especially when we consider the VR and AR business. This may sound optimistic, but given Facebook's record of beating analyst estimates, I am okay with sounding optimistic. The only hurdle that Facebook may run into is regulation, which is always on the table for big tech companies like it. However, it has has a record of successfully dealing with regulation and continuing to deliver good results despite of it so I'll take my chances.\n\n# The Balance Sheet\n\nNow, you may be thinking,\u00a0great, Facebook is positioned well for the future, but how are the fundamentals looking right now? We can see they are growing, but can they support that growth? Personally, I think so. Facebook has a tremendous balance sheet and a massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents. They currently have just over $64B as of 31th March 2021 which represents a $2-2.5B increase from the end of December 2020 and an increase of almost $10B since December 2019. The huge cash positions means that Facebook has enough capital to expand without being worried about financing, it means that it can buy new companies to help its expansion or to prevent competition, but most importantly, it means that the company is doing well. We can also see that in the company's share repurchase program. Facebook has repurchased $6.3B of shares in 2020 and $4.2B of shares in 2019 and, in January 2021, it authorized an additional $25B of stock repurchases so the total right now is about $34B. This doesn't mean that they will repurchase all $34B, but that they can. Still, the fact that they have authorized that programme is a positive sign. In addition to their massive stockpile of cash, Facebook only has liabilities of $30B or less than half the size of its cash stockpile. What does that mean? It means that Facebook is healthy and it's taking its vitamins. The company is solid and is more than able to tackle any short- or medium-term challenges to its business. It has no long-term debt, meaning that if they do decide to borrow money, they will be able to do so at much better rates than some of its rivals.\n\n# The Ratios\n\nThen, if we look at some the fundamental ratios, we can see that Facebook is. A. Beast! Their Return-on-Assets is 20.3% compared to the industry's average of 10.3% and their Return-on-Equity was 25.3% last year! Lets compare it to its rivals. I think that the companies closest to Facebook in terms of business are Twitter, Google, and Snapchat although Snap is in very early stages of growth. In terms of ROA and ROE, both Snapchat and Twitter are negative so there's not much point in comparing them, but Google has a 15.3% ROA. Their ROE is also lower at 22.3% as opposed to Facebook's 25.3%. Now, Facebook's forward Price-to-earnings ration is only 21.6 whereas Google has 25.5, Twitter's is 52.4 and Snapchat has a Forward PE of 92, so again, Facebook turns out to be the best price for its projected earnings. In terms of current PE, Facebook has 28.2, Google has 32.2 and Snapchat and Twitter don't have one because they are unprofitable. The current S&amp;P average PE is 37.2 so we can see that both Facebook and Google are under the market average although Facebook is again cheaper. What these ratios tell us is that Facebook is not only operating a very efficient business, but it's also at a very good price relative to its peers. Even looking at it historically, Facebook has rarely dropped below a PE of 27-28 so the current price is, again, excellent and cheap. This is my own opinion, feel free to do your own research, but according to my personal EPS growth we can expect a roughly 12% annual return on Facebook over the next 10 years if we buy it at $330. That is assuming a 15% earnings growth next year which will taper off and assuming that we can sell it at a PE ratio of around 30-32. If the earnings grow at around 20% next year, then we can look at a roughly 15% annual return which is higher than the average return of the S&amp;P 500, meaning that Facebook is likely to beat the market, at least in my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think? I'm sure that I've missed something in my analysis, but I think that I've covered the main bits. It can obviously be more detailed so I'll be happy if you can point out any gaps :)",

        "selftext": "Disclosure : long 1500 commons and 1000 warrants\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m no financial advisor, DYOR\n\nFTOC/Payoneer DD\n\n**Positions: FTOC shares, average price $13.24. Not financial advice.**\n\n**What is FTOC/Payoneer?**\n\nFtac Olympus Acquisition Corp (FTOC) is a SPAC led by Betsy Cohen that has a definitive agreement to merge with Payoneer.\n\nPayoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.\n\nPayoneer also offers:\n\n* Accounting integrations\n* Capital to small businesses\n* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure\n* Physical debit cards\n* Tax solutions\n\n**Management Team**\n\nScott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.\n\nMichael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.\n\nBetsy Cohen - CEO of FTOC. Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.\n\n**Customers**\n\nPayoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:\n\n* Amazon Europe\n* Google\n* eBay\n* Walmart\n* Upwork\n* Fiverr\n\nPayoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.\n\n**Switching Costs**\n\nIntegrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).\n\n**Brand**\n\nPayoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.\n\n**Network Effect**\n\nImagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.\n\n**Geographies**\n\nUNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.\n\nIf this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.\n\nSome evidence:\n\n* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.\n* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.\n\n**Valuation and Financials**\n\nAll numbers are based on original deal multiples (i.e based on when FTOC was $10 a share).\n\nEnterprise Value: $3.27 billion\n\nProjected 2021 revenue: $432 million\n\nEV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x\n\n2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%\n\nThis revenue growth is admittedly lower than one would desire for a FinTech company, and is often a criticism leveled against FTOC. However, considering the low EV/Revenue multiple (7.6x) compared to payment processing industry peers (36.5x), means the valuation more than compensates. Another FinTech going public through a SPAC, PaySafe, actually reported a 0.8% decrease in revenues from 2019-2020, but it recently hit $18 a share. (Nothing against PaySafe at all). Moreover, Payoneer\u2019s payment volume increased by 51% in the same timeframe, which will surely result in higher revenues in time. This should mean they reach their long-term target of yearly 20% revenue growth.\n\n**Institutional Ownership**\n\nPayoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n**Speculative Catalyst**\n\nIn ARK\u2019s Big Ideas 2021, FinTech was mentioned as a big theme that will prevail in 2021. If ARK were to add this cheap, promising FinTech firm to one of their funds, Payoneer will get the respect it deserves and will rocket upwards.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* There are many entrants in the payment processing industry, potentially driving down fees and increasing competition for customers\n* Revenue did not increase very much during 2020, despite a huge e-commerce boom\n* Big clients (which could be a large percentage of revenues) may drop Payoneer for some (hypothetical) reason\n\n**Personal Note**\n\nI use Payoneer as a contractor for Appen. I like it, it always has good customer service, quick payouts and low fees compared to other providers.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nBull Case: $26\n\nMain Case: $21\n\nBear Case: $16\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Just educated guesses.\n\nAs always DYOR, I have linked the investor presentation in the sources, 100% worth a read.",

        "selftext": "I was looking for Chinese stocks that would pay decent dividends (at least 2-3%), however, I cannot find any?\nI am wondering if the VIE structure has anything to do with that. If we buy BABA, NIO, TCEHY or whatever else, we don\u2019t get any actual ownership. \n\nAFAIK VIE works like the following. Chinese laws forbid foreigners from owning Chinese stocks. So the Chinese stock you buy actually only grants you a stake in some Cayman Islands-registered entity. These entities are under contracts to receive some profits from the Chinese assets but not to actually own them. This is how BABA, NIO, XPEV or whatever else Chinese works like. Besides, VIE technically is illegal but China has been silent on that.(more on the VIE structure https://globescancapital.com/chinese-vie-structure-wall-street-continues-to-ignore-the-risks/)\n\nAside from all the political risks, I am wondering - if a Chinese company no longer needs to raise capital in the West, why would it keep the obligation to share profits with the shareholders? If the VIE structure is not enforceable, the shareholders of the Cayman Island companies (again: BABA, XPEV, NIO) could end up with empty bags while the profits would go to CEO/board/Chinese shareholders.\n\nAlso given that shareholders are not entitled to any ACTUAL entity in the Chinese company, the board/CEO can decide to simply transfer ownership of the company\u2019s assets to somewhere else thus leaving shareholders emptyhanded and thus NIO, BABA and whatever else could easily go to 0 while the actual companies may thrive.\n\nAnd this can harm not only retail. There was this dispute between Yahoo and Alibaba when Jack Ma transfered ownership of Alipay from the group to an entity controlled by himself and didn\u2019t even inform other shareholders.(https://www.ft.com/content/40a66dd2-b9ec-11e0-8171-00144feabdc0)\n\nSo if the Chinese companies trading under VIE structure don\u2019t pay out their profits (technically the sole reason for the VIE structure), it looks like they should be bought only for speculation purposes.\n\nAre there any Chinese well established companies that share their profits and pay decent dividends to their VIE shareholders?",

I'm here to bring you a stock that I really like (1) have been beaten up UNFAIRLY recently but (2) will MOON - can't say you weren't invited on this ride.**\n\nWith that out of the way, to cater to the level of evolution in this civilisation the post will be split into the following 3 levels. Read them as how you would categorise yourself (don't cheat you bastards):\nL1: You're a primitive ape, probably can't tell what green and red drawings on your trading dashboard\nL2: You're a functioning ape, probably asking what shares and have very strong opinions on the hedgies &gt;:(\n\nAnd if you don't even consider yourself an ape, go to the bottom for the tl;dr.\n\n*So what's BEKE?*\n* Effectively, a real estate transactions platform, matching of demand and supply of residential properties (new, existing) as well as renovations. (MAIN POINT OF BUYING BEKE)\n* Also owns an offline brokerage brand (Lianjia), which drives some % of transaction value by the platform\n* Currently books ~8% of housing market in China\n\n*So what's going for it?*\nRising tide floats all boats: Chinese residential real estate market is expected to continue growing steadily over the short, medium and long-term - structurally favourable growing pie\n* L1: Real estate market will continue to go up steadily = good for BEKE and competitors' revenues\n* L2: Gross transaction value (GTV) of the market addressed by BEKE faces tailwinds in terms of demand and supply drivers \n   GTV increase = \n   Continued urbanisation to drive housing transactions (increased demand) + \n   Consumer demand for housing upgrades (increased demand) + \n   Guaranteed supply of new houses by the Chinese government (increased supply) +\n   Continued dependence on middlemen / brokerages to facilitate transactions in the opaque market (maintained penetration)\n\nUnrivalled proposition: BEKE owns a disruptive (best and sole-in-class / country serving as the broker-of-brokerages) and self-compounding business model, allowing it to snatch market share and become the dominant industry player\n* L1: BEKE = Only Shopify of real estate transactions in China = BEKE revenues &gt; Competitor's revenues\n* L2: BEKE will continually grab market share from a growing pie because of the flywheel effect within its business model, enabled by its 'Housing Dictionary' and best-in-class infrastructure to support the real estate transaction lifecycle. \n    Housing Dictionary = Largest and most accurate listing of properties in China, providing a superior transaction experience for all brokers and housing customers. The company sees this as a prized asset and dedicates resources to ensure the authenticity of listings, and have even offered cash rewards for every listing found to be untrue.\n    Best-in-class infrastructure = Software suite and services provided to external (partner) real estate brokerages and ability to link different participants across the workflow within a real estate brokerage, has not been replicated and have already formed a moat by being the first mover within the industry.\n    Self-compounding business model vs. rest of industry = By using the Housing Dictionary to provide a superior experience for customers and brokers, and the ability to onboard and improve the operating efficiency of brokerages, which then further supplements the Housing Dictionary, and thus providing a much superior experience again for customers and brokers, BEKE effectively outshine competitors who are typically advertising companies who have a transactional relationship with brokerages and customers.\n\nAttractive valuation: Street valuation does not account for BEKE\u2019s growth through network of other brokerage brands + the recent passing of the founder + antitrust rumours\n* L1: BEKE growth &gt; Wall Street estimates growth + Founder have relinquished management duties to co-founder before death + antitrust so? Look at the inconsequential fines given to BABA lol\n* L2: BEKE will outperform in growth in revenues and profits (oh look they are already profitable as a growth company) against the concerns:\n    Partner brokerage network based on Wall Street estimates assume that revenues from that segment will stall by 2023 - what a joke; based on the value proposition of the company, this will continue to grow at an exponential rate as (i) more brokerages are onboarded onto the platform to improve their sales efficiency and (ii) more % of businesses by each onboarded brokerages improve as they realise they can partake in more transactions through the aggregation of transactions by the platform.\n    Founder sits on the board before passing away, shares that he hold in a trust (70+%) is mandated to be held for minimally 1 year. Additionally, this means that institutional holdings of the company is 80+% - just saying there might be some possibilities here :)\n    Antitrust concerns are overblown - seriously guys what are they going to do? Alibaba who did a shit ton of anti-competitive practices and had Jack Ma just straight up shit on the CCP had a 2.8BN CNY fine (4% of revenues, big fucking whoop).\n\ntl;dr BEKE is criminally undervalued. and a growth stock you definitely would want in your holdings :)\n\nMandatory disclaimer, I am Long BEKE and 400 shares and leaps. This is not financial advice I just like the stock!",

The 65,000 DC  members were far below the 200,000 members that the market was expecting.  This has already been priced in with analysts adjusting down to an average price target of $9.33 ([source](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLOV/research-ratings)).  GREEDY SHORTS ARE JUST TRYING TO STICK IT TO CHAMATH BY TRYING TO PUSH THIS BELOW $9.\n\nThe 200,000 DC members are the number of Medicare Part B patients they have access to through the 1,800 providers using their software.  They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time.  They set forecasts at 70,000 to 100,000 by end of 2021.  They already have 65,000 enrolled in April.  They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward.\n\nTo understand what CLOV should be worth today, look at OSH and AGL.  All three companies are Direct Contracting Entities (DCE) competing for risk-bearing Medicare patients.  They all should be valued based on the number of risk-based patients they have and how fast they're growing that number.  The value of each risk-based patient depends on each company's model, which drives profit rates.\n\n**OSH = $14.3B market cap**\n\nOSH is obviously liked the most by the market, probably because they employ the clinicians so they can keep more of the Medicare premium and could theoretically do more to improve health outcomes and control costs.  In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% off the top, and the rest goes to OSH.\n\n* **OSH gross margin = 6.7%** ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/osh/financials))\n* **6,500 DC risk-based patients** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))\n* **75,500 total risk-based patients growing to 112,000 this year** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))\n* **That's a valuation of $125,000 per patient**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AGL = $14.3B market cap**\n\nAGL holds the contract with the MA plan and then pays the contracted (not employed) provider practices.  In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% of the premium off the top, and the rest is split between AGL and the provider practices.\n\n* **AGL gross margin = 7%** ([source](https://capital.com/agilon-health-ipo-will-the-stock-soar-in-2021))\n* **50,000 DC risk-based patients** ([source](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001831097/98fb566d-8f47-4a36-bd48-6bef5745cf56.pdf))\n* **165,300 total risk-based patients growing to 210,000 this year** ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-agilon-health-ipo/healthcare-platform-agilon-valued-at-about-11-billion-in-nyse-debut-idUSKBN2C22D7))\n* **That's a valuation of $66,667 per patient**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CLOV = $3.65B market cap**\n\nCLOV has historically been just a MA plan, taking the 15% of the premium off the top and paying the rest to cover the patient's costs.  MA plans have an average profit margin of 4.3% after all their admin and sales expenses are accounted for ([source](https://mhk.com/medicare-advantage-is-the-golden-egg-for-health-plans/)).\n\n* **CLOV historical gross margin (before COVID effect) = 2.5-4.1 %** ([source](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213))\n* **65,000 DC risk-based patients** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))\n* **132,000 total risk-based patients growing to 160,000 this year** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))\n* **That's a valuation of $22,800 per patient**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AGL is a good preview of how the DC model could be valued per patient, except the DC model should be even better.  There is no MA plan taking 15% off the top in between the risk-bearer (Direct Contracting Entity: CLOV, AGL, or OSH) and Medicare.  Direct Contracting patients could be valued as high as $76,667 (15% premium over current AGL patients).**\n\nThe CEO of OSH was recently quoted \"**the per-patient economics of that program will potentially be better than the company had initially estimated\"** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))**.**\n\nOriginal post by u/livinittt on r/clov",

        "selftext": "BBIG: The Next Gamma Squeeze.\n\nThis DD is a work in progress so bear with me.\n\n**Catalyst**: \n\nBBIG is currently undergoing a merger with Zash (who has a controlling stake in Lomotif). According to the latest update by the company, they anticipate that the Gemini Valuation Services will complete and present to Vinco an independent third party valuation on Zash on or before June 11th.\n\n**What is Zash**: \n\nThe entertainment industry disrupter led by co-founders Ted Farnsworth, financier and former MoviePass Chairman, early Musical.ly (now TikTok) investor Jaeson Ma, and early Triller visionary and board member, Vincent Butta, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a majority controlling interest in Lomotif Private Limited (\u201cLomotif\u201d), the Singapore-based top video-sharing social networking platform and budding rival to TikTok, and Kuaishou\n\nWhy you should care: The valuation of ByteDance (which owns TikTok) came in at close to 250$ billion in the private market. Up from the previously listed 140$ billion: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-30/bytedance-is-said-valued-at-250-billion-in-private-trades#:\\~:text=%2B2.00%2B0.32%25-,Shares%20of%20ByteDance%20Ltd.%2C%20the%20Chinese%20parent%20of%20hit%20video,people%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-30/bytedance-is-said-valued-at-250-billion-in-private-trades#:~:text=%2B2.00%2B0.32%25-,Shares%20of%20ByteDance%20Ltd.%2C%20the%20Chinese%20parent%20of%20hit%20video,people%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter).\n\nBBIG currently trades at close to 120 million in market cap. If the Lomotif valuation comes even at a fraction of the Tik Tok valuation (and these high growth tech start ups tend to come with a bigger valuation) the upside potential has not even been close to realized. Even a billion dollar valuation (a shadow in comparison to TikTok) would be enough to 5-10x the stock price.\n\n**Big Players:** \n\nZack Morris announced close to a $2 million dollar position in this stock according to his Twitter. His twitter followers have flooded to take up shares as well.\n\nInstitutional ownership has been increasing over the course of the past two months with clear buys and limited to no selling: [https://fintel.io/so/us/bbig#:\\~:text=Institutional%20Ownership%20and%20Shareholders,Securities%20Exchange%20Commission%20(SEC).&amp;text=Major%20shareholders%20can%20include%20individual,%2C%20hedge%20funds%2C%20or%20institutions](https://fintel.io/so/us/bbig#:~:text=Institutional%20Ownership%20and%20Shareholders,Securities%20Exchange%20Commission%20(SEC).&amp;text=Major%20shareholders%20can%20include%20individual,%2C%20hedge%20funds%2C%20or%20institutions).\n\n**Gamma Squeeze Potential**: \n\nThere has been a dramatic increase in the amount of short dated contracts expiring around 5$. A recent photo circulated on Twitter of the options activity has 316,000 calls to 7,000 puts. A continued increase of this activity and institutions that underwrite these options will have to buy shares to cover the short positions thus creating a \u2018squeeze\u2019 we saw with AMC.\n\n**To Sum/TL;DR:** \n\n-Valuation news is set to come out at some point next week. While it won\u2019t come close to TikTok, if it even grabs a fraction of the market share there is no saying how high it could go. \n\n-Big players are currently loading the stock in these ranges. From big institutional investors to well-known stock traders. \n\n-If the options activity continues (with more people buying short dated options) this might in turn generate a Gamma Squeeze of epic proportions.\n\nI am currently long at 3.19. \n\n**As always, this is not financial advice and do your own DD.**",

        "selftext": "Disclosure: long 1500 commons and 1000 warrants \n\nFTOC/Payoneer DD\n\n**Positions: FTOC shares, average price $13.24. Not financial advice.**\n\n**What is FTOC/Payoneer?**\n\nFtac Olympus Acquisition Corp (FTOC) is a SPAC led by Betsy Cohen that has a definitive agreement to merge with Payoneer.\n\nPayoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.\n\nPayoneer also offers:\n\n* Accounting integrations\n* Capital to small businesses\n* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure\n* Physical debit cards\n* Tax solutions\n\n**Management Team**\n\nScott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.\n\nMichael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.\n\nBetsy Cohen - CEO of FTOC. Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.\n\n**Customers**\n\nPayoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:\n\n* Amazon Europe\n* Google\n* eBay\n* Walmart\n* Upwork\n* Fiverr\n\nPayoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.\n\n**Switching Costs**\n\nIntegrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).\n\n**Brand**\n\nPayoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.\n\n**Network Effect**\n\nImagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.\n\n**Geographies**\n\nUNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.\n\nIf this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.\n\nSome evidence:\n\n* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.\n* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.\n\n**Valuation and Financials**\n\nAll numbers are based on original deal multiples (i.e based on when FTOC was $10 a share).\n\nEnterprise Value: $3.27 billion\n\nProjected 2021 revenue: $432 million\n\nEV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x\n\n2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%\n\nThis revenue growth is admittedly lower than one would desire for a FinTech company, and is often a criticism leveled against FTOC. However, considering the low EV/Revenue multiple (7.6x) compared to payment processing industry peers (36.5x), means the valuation more than compensates. Another FinTech going public through a SPAC, PaySafe, actually reported a 0.8% decrease in revenues from 2019-2020, but it recently hit $18 a share. (Nothing against PaySafe at all). Moreover, Payoneer\u2019s payment volume increased by 51% in the same timeframe, which will surely result in higher revenues in time. This should mean they reach their long-term target of yearly 20% revenue growth.\n\n**Institutional Ownership**\n\nPayoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n**Speculative Catalyst**\n\nIn ARK\u2019s Big Ideas 2021, FinTech was mentioned as a big theme that will prevail in 2021. If ARK were to add this cheap, promising FinTech firm to one of their funds, Payoneer will get the respect it deserves and will rocket upwards.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* There are many entrants in the payment processing industry, potentially driving down fees and increasing competition for customers\n* Revenue did not increase very much during 2020, despite a huge e-commerce boom\n* Big clients (which could be a large percentage of revenues) may drop Payoneer for some (hypothetical) reason\n\n**Personal Note**\n\nI use Payoneer as a contractor for Appen. I like it, it always has good customer service, quick payouts and low fees compared to other providers.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nBull Case: $26\n\nMain Case: $21\n\nBear Case: $16\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Just educated guesses.\n\nAs always DYOR, I have linked the investor presentation in the sources, 100% worth a read.",

        "selftext": "Unlike the low-growth businesses of video game stores and movie theaters, Clover provides an artificial intelligence-based platform that helps physicians deliver better care at lower costs. So far, it has targeted Medicare-eligible patients. That's a growing population in a country where 10,000 people turn 65 years old every day. The company's secret sauce is something called the Clover Assistant. It's a platform that brings patient data from many sources -- primary care physicians (PCPs), specialists, hospitals, clinics, labs, and pharmacies -- and marries it with socioeconomic factors to apply machine learning. The result is an interface for PCPs that guides them to improve clinical decision making.\n\nSince its founding, Clover Health has been focused on the Medicare Advantage (MA) market. It's a crowded field -- there are more than 3,000 MA plans from private insurance companies -- but the young insurer has steadily gained share. That's produced solid growth in membership and revenue, but it hasn't yet translated to positive cash flow. A good proxy for that is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Even when adjusted for non-recurring costs, it's getting worse as a percent of sales.\n\nManagement claims that its participants have 22% fewer hospital visits and 23% fewer emergency room visits. However, that's compared to an internal baseline so it's hard to say. A better measure might be the medical care ratio (MCR). It's the percent of insurance premiums spent providing care and services, so lower is better. Clover's platform is proving to reduce the cost of care when removing COVID-related expenses that did not exist in 2019.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive measure is the 92% of onboarded PCPs using the platform for eligible visits. After all, you can't produce results with analytics alone. Even the best algorithms in healthcare require behavior change. That's true for both doctors and patients. Here, the value of the platform is evident.\n\nDespite the success, the company isn't standing pat. It recently launched a direct contracting option. That's a risk-sharing agreement for original Medicare where the company is paid per member and assumes the risk of delivering good outcomes at a cost below what they are being paid. If they do, what they save becomes profit. Direct contracting led to lives under management nearly doubling to 130,000 in the most recent quarter. It plans to end the year with between 70,000 and 100,000 members in the program.\n\nThe discrepancy has called some of management's other claims into question. Clover Health has an innovative approach to helping physicians deliver better outcomes for patients at a lower cost. Its first offering in the MA market seems to deliver. That market is a whopping $270 billion and is expected to grow to $590 billion by 2025. It's now throwing its hat in the ring for original Medicare. That market was $800 billion in 2019. Those numbers mean the company has a chance to succeed in a big way.\n\nIt will still have to overcome healthcare giants with their own Medicare plans like UnitedHealth Group, Anthem, and Cigna. The curious thing about MA and the healthcare industry in general is that a better solution doesn't necessarily guarantee success. The complexity of the shopping experience for consumers and stickiness of existing systems can make it difficult for something new to gain traction.\n\nClover Health has been able to do that in its few established markets since being founded in 2013. However, as artificial intelligence plays a more prominent role in patient care, the larger insurers have the advantage of more data. Clover Health's early success could simply be the test case that convinces larger players to roll out their own platforms. With the recent craziness in the stock price, investors might want to wait for proof that the company has a path to profitability before buying shares.",

I committed a full 250 share allotment on Fidelity after I had passed on an opportunity to purchase pre-IPO shares through EquityZen\n\n**First.** The [S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001516513/000162828021011269/doximity-sx1.htm) filing is located here.\n\n**Second,** Their financials. For any company you want to look at:\n\n* Revenue (also called 'top line')\n* Operating Expenses\n* Profit (also called 'bottom line') which is more or less revenue - expenses\n* Cash on hand\n* Debt\n* Why they are going IPO\n\nYou want to see that the company is making money both top line and bottom line, you want to see that their costs are not outstripping their revenue and profit growth. **When you are investing in a stock, you are basically laying an (educated) bet that the company will grow their profits. When they grow, your stock grows.**\n\nFor the last bullet, you want to see that they have money so that they won't go bankrupt. Generally for why IPO, if the prospectus says, \"to pay back debt\" or \"the company will not receive any proceeds\" then stay the hell away. You want the company to use the money they raise to fund new ventures or anything that will help them grow.\n\nSo, under the hood (and very simplified):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||2019|2020|2021|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenues|85.7mm|116.4mm (+30.7%)|206.9mm (+78%)|\n|Expenses|67.9mm|79.3mm (+16.8%)|122.4mm (+54.3%)|\n|Profit|7.8mm|23.5mm (+201%)|57.7mm (+145%)|\n\nWhat do we see:\n\n* Increasing rate of change growth in revenue from 2019 -&gt; 2020, and 2020 -&gt; 2021\n* Increasing expenses but rate of change is not as much as rate of change of revenues\n* Profit every year. Though 2020 - 2021 growth is not as much as 2019 - 2020, it's still more than doubled\n\nDOCS has 142mm in cash on hand, and the only \"debt\" they have is in the form of convertible preferred stock - i.e. no loans taken out.\n\nWhy are they IPOing? They are going to use the funds to support growth and investments in the business, or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets.\n\n**In Summary**.\n\nSolely from a financial perspective, the company grows revenues and profits year over year. Their expenses are growing but not as rapidly - plus if you dive into their S-1 they have a significant portion of those expenses used for research and development, which in my mind is actually not an expense but more of an investment in their future. They have cash on hand and no debt. It's a slam dunk and I am not surprised that the IPO priced 3 dollars above their upper range because everyone with financial know how and the ability to get their hands on the stock wanted it.\n\nCheers and best wishes.\n\n*Obligatory not financial advice, do your own research, I like the stock, etc. etc.*",

        "selftext": "What's poppin' everyone, hope you're all doing well! We've got a couple of pretty appealing tickers to play this week, and I'm excited to share them with the community! I'm constantly refining my charts and trying to improve, so if you see anything wrong with them, or feel like I have a bad read, let me know! That being said, let's get into it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**Mastercard - 1 Day Chart**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/p/pztJjW1Q.png)\n\n\u27a5 Our downside is pinned at a key support level, while our wedge is coiling tighter by the day. At some point, buyers or seller will have to give, and we should get a clean move up or down. This one could honestly go either way as the buyers at the 361.50 level have been extremely consistent while the lows have been getting lower as the week went on. If 361.50 gives we will see 355 rather quickly, though the bleeding will likely stop there. That being said, any upside move we get will be rather explosive due to the lack of any overhead resistances past this point. Look to play the breakout on this one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**Chewy - 4 Hour Chart**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/2/2XEky75e.png)\n\n \u27a5 $CHWY is shaping up to be a solid trade going into this week! Price has been consolidating coming off of a hot earnings, and it looks like we're setting up to make a move upwards. We've got lot's of key historical support levels below, with little resistance above. We may revisit the 76 level before the breakout, which could prove to be a good entry point for those who want the cheapest possible entry before blastoff. If we breakout to the upside, we may encounter some resistance around 80 and 83, though from there it's smooth sailing until 88. If we fail the breakout we'll likely be rangebound between 72 and 76 for a bit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**Sunrun - 4 Hour Chart**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E0RwKVT.png)\n\n\u27a5 My [trading bot](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/) actually caught this play before the huge 10% breakout on Thursday, though this play is still good throughout this week as well. Currently we're pinned up against the 52.70 resistance, but if it breaks, we likely see 58. I don't feel comfortable playing the downside on this one because there's been some insane strength coming out of solar this past week, so I expect to see it run throughout this one as well. That being said, if we start falling, we'll likely take a trip down to 46 quite quickly. Regardless, I'm expecting a break of 52.70 and a run up to 58. From there we could even see mid 60s.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n[**Roku - 4 Hour Chart**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/O4x8qiA8.png)\n\n\u27a5 Although a little cluttered, these Roku levels are very consistent - Nothing too crazy happening this week. Ideally we want to enter a trade once we bounce off of 357/361, and ride it up to 377. Given that we close above 377, we'll see 400 extremely quickly. That being said, Roku moves aggressively, so you'll want to have your alerts set for this one. If we lose both support levels, we'll be making a trip down to 344, so make sure you have stops in place.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[**CLF - 4 Hour Chart**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/lk3fhS1r.png)\n\n\u27a5 To finish this post off, we've got an extremely simple trade. Most steel stocks got absolutely smashed this past week, and CLF is no exception. That being said, CLF's channel has held *extremely* consistently since March, and this week will likely be the same. Those looking to enter a long position should do so at this level, as we likely won't go much lower. If you believe in the fundamental steel thesis as a whole, you can't go wrong grabbing shares at these prices. Option buyers beware, the IV on these contracts is still jacked up from the initial launch we had last week, so those looking for some additional leverage may want to sit on the sidelines while it unwinds.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat more or less wraps up the watchlist. We should have ourselves an exciting week of trading! Let me know if you have any technical setups you personally plan on playing, or if I botched something on mine! If you want to interact with me throughout the week or see any chart updates, feel free to follow me on Twitter, or join my Discord! Links can be found on my profile. Happy trading everyone :\\^)",

        "selftext": "# Price\n\nFacebook currently trades at around $330. Its latest support is at around $296 to $300 and its latest resistance is actually around $330 so essentially the price that it's trading for right now. This is a crucial moment. If it manages to break $330, then we can see an upward movement going up to $360 which is the high ceiling of this channel that it has started forming. If you haven't invested yet, it could be a good time to wait for a couple of days or a week to see how its price will evolve. I have a feeling that it will start consolidating or it could slowly drop down to $315 or, worst case scenario, $300. It is currently trading above its 50D MA and its Relative Strength Index is near the top, but the volume is relatively low which makes me think that we probably won't see a lot of movement in the next week or two. However, as I said, I think that there is a good chance that we can see Facebook hitting $360 in a few months and maybe even $400 by the end of the year. Why? Well, Facebook has been delivering great results after great results. The fundamental performance of the company has been amazing so far. Absolutely amazing! In fact, out of ALL of its 20 earnings reports since 2016, it has only missed 1 and that was by 1 cent and it has only missed revenue ***twice***! The company outperforms analyst expectations and by a big margin, especially in the last 4 quarters. Last quarter, it beat analyst earnings expectations by 41%! This is massive! Especially for a company of Facebook's size! Essentially, what we are seeing is the pandemic boost in advertising that Facebook received was not as transitory as analysts expected. Also, there has been nothing but upward revisions for Facebook's Full Year 2021 earnings, which is a very good sign. 39 upward revisions in total! There have also been 23 upward earnings revisions for next quarter's earnings, which is almost always a good sign. Also, out of the 51 analyst covering Facebook in May, 45 have had a Buy or a Strong Buy rating!\n\n# The Business\n\nHowever, let's leave analyst opinions aside for the moment. They are good to gauge Wall Street's appetite for the company, but let's look at the business, at the fundamentals. Is Facebook really a good company? Facebook's main source of revenue are the ***advertising revenues that*** come from ads on its products, the Facebook app and website, Instagram, Whatsapp and Messenger. By gathering user data, Facebook is able to offer targeted ads which are obviously more expensive, but are also more attractive to advertisers. Even though regulators have reduced the amount of data that Facebook can gather and therefore reduced its ability to target specific audiences through its ads, the company has still managed to grow its advertising business by a LOT! Another reason why the company has done so well is because it operates the 7th most website in the world, Facebook, which is also the 2nd most visited social media website behind YouTube. Instagram is extremely popular as well, ranking in the 23rd place! As of the latest quarter, the Daily active users of Facebook's family of products are 2.72 BILLION with the number of monthly active users being 3.45 BILLION or more than 10 times the population of the US! This is literally half of the world's population! Facebook is still seeing growth in user numbers with its total user base up 15% year-on-year which is actually faster than last year's increase of 11%. So, we can see that their user base is growing, but is that translating into higher revenues? The answer: yes! In 2020, Facebook reported a 20% year-on-year advertising revenue increase, but in their last quarter alone, the advertising revenue increase was 46% compared to last year! Advertising makes about 98% of Facebook's revenue so we can see that the company is getting a serious boost in overall profits. Their net income also grew by 58% in 2020 year-on-year and an astonishing 94% in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to last year! Essentially, we can see that Facebook is reporting some serious growth for a megacap company and it is largely due to the increase in their advertising business. However, Facebook are also involved in Virtual and Augmented Reality through their Reality Labs. While this side of Facebook is still tiny, it is reporting a serious growth in revenues as well. In the first quarter of 2021, its revenue grew by almost 150% as compared to last year and now makes up 2.7% of Facebook's revenue! VR and AR are still relatively young industries, but they are growing fast as we can see. Market researchers claim that the industry will grow at an annual rate of 42% from $37B in 2019 to an astonishing $1.27T in 2030! Facebook is one of the leaders in this space along with Apple, Microsoft and Samsung so this represents a massive opportunity for the tech giant and yet another solid bullish argument for Facebook. Unlike its competitors, Facebook's business is relatively concentrated so I think this gives the company a competitive advantage when it comes to growing its VR and AR business. The company has also grown its headcount by 30% in 2020 so we can see that it is doubling down on expansion and growth. Despite that, analysts are only expecting a revenue and earnings growth of about 15% annually for the next 3 years. To some extent, that is justified as Facebook did get a big bump in earnings due to COVID. However, I think that their estimates lean towards the conservative side and I think that Facebook can actually achieve a growth of between 20% and 25%, especially when we consider the VR and AR business. This may sound optimistic, but given Facebook's record of beating analyst estimates, I am okay with sounding optimistic. The only hurdle that Facebook may run into is regulation, which is always on the table for big tech companies like it. However, it has has a record of successfully dealing with regulation and continuing to deliver good results despite of it so I'll take my chances.\n\n# The Balance Sheet\n\nNow, you may be thinking,\u00a0great, Facebook is positioned well for the future, but how are the fundamentals looking right now? We can see they are growing, but can they support that growth? Personally, I think so. Facebook has a tremendous balance sheet and a massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents. They currently have just over $64B as of 31th March 2021 which represents a $2-2.5B increase from the end of December 2020 and an increase of almost $10B since December 2019. The huge cash positions means that Facebook has enough capital to expand without being worried about financing, it means that it can buy new companies to help its expansion or to prevent competition, but most importantly, it means that the company is doing well. We can also see that in the company's share repurchase program. Facebook has repurchased $6.3B of shares in 2020 and $4.2B of shares in 2019 and, in January 2021, it authorized an additional $25B of stock repurchases so the total right now is about $34B. This doesn't mean that they will repurchase all $34B, but that they can. Still, the fact that they have authorized that programme is a positive sign. In addition to their massive stockpile of cash, Facebook only has liabilities of $30B or less than half the size of its cash stockpile. What does that mean? It means that Facebook is healthy and it's taking its vitamins. The company is solid and is more than able to tackle any short- or medium-term challenges to its business. It has no long-term debt, meaning that if they do decide to borrow money, they will be able to do so at much better rates than some of its rivals.\n\n# The Ratios\n\nThen, if we look at some the fundamental ratios, we can see that Facebook is. A. Beast! Their Return-on-Assets is 20.3% compared to the industry's average of 10.3% and their Return-on-Equity was 25.3% last year! Lets compare it to its rivals. I think that the companies closest to Facebook in terms of business are Twitter, Google, and Snapchat although Snap is in very early stages of growth. In terms of ROA and ROE, both Snapchat and Twitter are negative so there's not much point in comparing them, but Google has a 15.3% ROA. Their ROE is also lower at 22.3% as opposed to Facebook's 25.3%. Now, Facebook's forward Price-to-earnings ration is only 21.6 whereas Google has 25.5, Twitter's is 52.4 and Snapchat has a Forward PE of 92, so again, Facebook turns out to be the best price for its projected earnings. In terms of current PE, Facebook has 28.2, Google has 32.2 and Snapchat and Twitter don't have one because they are unprofitable. The current S&amp;P average PE is 37.2 so we can see that both Facebook and Google are under the market average although Facebook is again cheaper. What these ratios tell us is that Facebook is not only operating a very efficient business, but it's also at a very good price relative to its peers. Even looking at it historically, Facebook has rarely dropped below a PE of 27-28 so the current price is, again, excellent and cheap. This is my own opinion, feel free to do your own research, but according to my personal EPS growth we can expect a roughly 12% annual return on Facebook over the next 10 years if we buy it at $330. That is assuming a 15% earnings growth next year which will taper off and assuming that we can sell it at a PE ratio of around 30-32. If the earnings grow at around 20% next year, then we can look at a roughly 15% annual return which is higher than the average return of the S&amp;P 500, meaning that Facebook is likely to beat the market, at least in my opinion.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I'm sure that I've missed something in my analysis, but I think that I've covered the main bits. It can obviously be more detailed so I'll be happy if you can point out any gaps :)",

A note before diving in that no start-up will have all Lower Risk or all Higher Risk traits - each will bring its own idiosyncracies. Higher Risk traits do not necessarily correlate with a bad business/idea, just as Lower Risk traits do not signify that a business will be a success.\n\n## Addressing Feedback\n\nI will briefly address feedback to Part 1, but please skip to Management Risk if this is not of interest. Comments mostly focused on what the model is suitable for rather than how it worked.\n\nIn summary, this overview is written from the perspective of a retail investor looking to invest in early-stage companies without the networks, access to founders, and sourcing tools of an institutional VC or angel investor. Therefore, I will make reference to the RSF as a \u201cFramework\u201d to aid thinking rather than a valuation methodology. Typically, retail investors without significant capital would invest through crowdsourcing platforms and have zero say in the valuation of the start-up and may not have the chance to meet a founder face-to-face and delve into a company\u2019s IP. As a result, retail investors may use the RSF framework primarily to consider the overall riskiness of a company, rather than a target valuation, though an insight into valuation would still be provided and help inform the final investment decision. However, it\u2019s still useful to understand how the method was intended to work, which is what I covered in Part 1.\n\n**Suitability for evaluating public / post-revenue companies:** this method would not be suitable for valuing more mature companies, both in public and private markets, as many other data points (e.g. earnings) can be used for valuing late-stage or mature companies. However, some of the risks described by the RSF are universal for all companies and so this post may still be helpful to engage with.\n\n**A non-institutional approach:** it was suggested that the way different VC\u2019s value start-ups is subjective, and also that the RSF Valuation Method is less likely to be used by institutional venture capitalists and seed investors. I do not disagree with these points, but will respond that professional investors have the ability to interview founders and gain private access to the company\u2019s IP, which is often not available to retail investors. Retail investors without significant capital will typically invest through crowdsourcing platforms (e.g. StartEngine, Wefunder, Seedrs, Crowdcube) and have less information to make a decision on. Retail investors using these platforms also have to deal with a pre-determined valuation and I hypothesise that most companies would therefore be \u201covervalued\u201d, as the power to set terms (i.e. how much equity to give away and at what price) rests strongly with the company and not the retail investors. Therefore, retail investors cannot use the same approach as institutional VCs and angel investors and a framework for properly evaluating investment opportunities is critical.\n\n**\u201cI am skeptical of any founder and management of start-ups that cannot raise smart money through angel and VC funds.\u201d** This is a great argument in support of developing a robust evaluation method. Although some founders turn to crowdsourcing for honest reasons, I am sure many do so to avoid more stringent due diligence (especially regarding financials) that they would face from an institutional VC. We should be aware that investing in start-ups is high risk, that retail investors likely face more selection risk than institutional VCs due to lack of data/transparency (which is true of most asset classes), and that retail investors need to be careful in allocating capital to start-ups. Target companies should be high conviction, and the resulting portfolio should be well diversified with many small bets. An allocation to seed-stage businesses should also be appropriately sized within a well diversified total portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## 1. Management Risk\n\n*What is the risk imposed by the current business management team?*\n\nVenture Capitalists constantly throw around fun words to describe what they look for in a founding team. Courage... Determination... Grit... Chutzpah... Spunk? Management Risk is often considered the most important risk of those considered in the RSF Valuation Method and thus should be carefully considered.  Through my reading, I've suggested some ideas of what would lower management risk, and what might increase it.\n\n**Lower Risk**\n\n* Founders with *Courage* (not giving up in the face of adversity; determined to succeed; can learn from mistakes) and *Genius* (groundbreaking ideas; a visionary way of thinking). Other important traits: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management, ambition, and entrepreneurialism.\n* Relevant backgrounds and expertise, including diversity of experience and thought.\n* Management with experience founding and successfully exiting start-ups, especially in the target sector/industry.\n* Strong alignment, i.e. working on the business full-time.\n* Access to strong advisors.\n* Willing to partner with investors.\n\n**Higher Risk**\n\n* Founders who are short-sighted, sweat the small stuff excessively, are hot-headed / of ill-temperament, and opposites of the lower risk traits.\n* Co-founders or other leaders leaving in the early stages of the company\u2019s life (caveat: there may be situations where this is healthy for the business, e.g. if causing friction within management).\n* Lack of relevant experience.\n* New to the start-up environment.\n* Team still to be built out.\n* Unclear responsibilities.\n* Lack of alignment, i.e. splitting focus by working on other business projects.\n\nThis is an easier risk factor to understand. While it can be harder as an individual investor to gain insight into management without meeting the founders and/or management team, taking advantage of webinars or fundraise pitch calls to see the leadership in action and using sources like LinkedIn to evaluate prior experience can be invaluable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## 2. Stage of the Business\n\n*How mature is the business and what is the inherent risk of failure?*\n\nIt is an unspoken understanding that a lot of start-ups fail. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp) covers the reasons why quite well, with the statistic that U.S. start-up [failure rates in 2019](https://www.national.biz/2019-small-business-failure-rate-startup-statistics-industry/) were around 90%. 2020 saw the same 90% rate, and this and a lot of other cool statistics were reported by [Review42](https://review42.com/resources/what-percentage-of-startups-fail/) in Feb 2021.\n\nWe accept that the nature of start-ups brings an inherently high failure rate. So how do we apply a score from +2 to -2? There are a couple of ideas below, but Redditors should chip in with further examples here, or suggest whether these traits belong under other factors:\n\n**Lower Risk**\n\n* Prototype developed, tested, and proven to work.\n* Market validation, i.e. first customers acquired and sales made.\n* Employee headcount growing.\n* Strategic relationships developed, e.g. joint ventures, marketing alliances, licensing arrangements, selling/distribution, etc.\n\n**Higher Risk**\n\n* Prototype not developed, i.e. still in the concept phase.\n* No demonstration of product-market fit.\n* Low headcount beyond founders, or limited growth.\n\nWhile it is easy to tar every start-up with a thick brush labeled \"-2\", we should remember that start-ups must be judged relative to one another and to their industry. Therefore, we should be conscious of how companies may be marked up, as well as down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## 3. Legislation / Political Risk\n\n*Will politics or regulation hamper business growth?*\n\nThis can be difficult to judge and I welcome other's views on this. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/politicalrisk.asp) again offers a good overview as to the inherent difficulties in quantifying this risk factor:\n\n&gt;Political risk is the risk an investment's returns could suffer as a result of political changes or instability in a country. Instability affecting investment returns could stem from a change in government, legislative bodies, other foreign policymakers or military control. Political risk is also known as \"geopolitical risk,\" and becomes more of a factor as the time horizon of investment gets longer. They are considered a type of [jurisdiction risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jurisdiction-risk.asp).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Political risks are notoriously hard to quantify because there are limited sample sizes or case studies when discussing an individual nation. Some political risks can be insured against through international agencies or other government bodies. The outcome of political risk could drag down investment returns or even go so far as to remove the ability to withdraw capital from an investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lower Risk**\n\n* Governments aligned with the objectives of the business (e.g. the recent impetus for green energy and reduction for climate impact).\n* Operating in countries with stable political processes and leadership.\n* Government unlikely to interfere with the business or its management team, including in the case of M&amp;A activity.\n\n**Higher Risk**\n\n* Government (positioned to start) implementing legislation making business operations more challenging.\n* Operating in countries with volatile legislative and political frameworks\n* Government can interfere with business operations.\n\nAn example of government being well aligned with business objectives is the recent impetus for green energy and reduction for climate impact, especially in Europe and increasingly in the US, which provides incentives for or decreases the legislative risk to green-focused start-ups. An example of a government interfering with business can be seen in the recent [China-Ant Group / Jack Ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_Group#Backlash_from_regulators) situation which resulted in a highly anticipated $34 billion IPO being halted. I would love to hear more risks and examples for this section, and whether you think I\u2019m hitting the right areas, as it is a more difficult factor to quantify.\n\nRegarding disruptive technology, which is often seen in early-stage companies, it may be the case that a start-up is among the first in the birth of a new industry. In time, this may lead to new and novel regulation. An example is how politicians and central banks are increasingly taking note of blockchain technology and related cryptocurrencies. If disrupted sectors are important to the government or other agents (e.g. the financial industry and national currencies), regulation may be applied harder/more tightly and previously innovative companies may be stifled. Conversely, a new industry showing great opportunity for society may be encouraged to grow.\n\nWhich leads me to something to bear in mind: not all regulation is bad, and not all de-regulation is good. Kate Raworth makes an excellent point in her book Doughnut Economics on how de-regulation is really just \"re-regulation\" anyway. An example once given during a panel on Machine Learning &amp; AI at the Royal Society highlighted that it was only once regulation regarding privacy and restricting the use of cameras on drones in [Sweden](https://uavcoach.com/drone-laws-in-sweden/) did drone innovation really take off in the country. The rules must be known before the game can be properly played. I offer this only as a counter-example to the commonly held belief that de-regulation or an unregulated environment is always the best environment for a business to operate in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## 4. Manufacturing Risk or Service Delivery Risk\n\n*Could the business fail to produce products or deliver a service?*\n\nA brilliant management team and an excellent market environment mean nothing if the supply chain or ability to provide a service is unavailable. In 2020, UK-EU relations made headlines as the ability for the UK and Europe to share supply chains to produce COVID-19 vaccines fell to implicit and explicit threats on each side that access to raw materials could be shut off if vaccines were not shared equitably. There are elements of Political and International risk in this scenario, but the point is that if a company does not have the raw materials required to produce its good, or the channels available through which to deliver its service, then it is going to have a hard time producing any revenues.\n\nManufacturing risk can cover not just the ability to consistently obtain necessary raw materials at an attractive and stable price point but also maintaining the necessary equipment and the relevant expertise within a company to produce an end-product of suitable quality from those materials.\n\nService Delivery Risk I believe has two angles. One is services the business owner requires to run their business. The other is the ability to provide a service to their customers. For the first, an example would be [counterparty risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp), and is the risk that one party will not make good on its end of the agreement. This is more likely to be a problem in times of financial stress as various measures are often put in place to mitigate this risk in more normal economic times. For the second, this is typically people-driven and can include having the right expertise available and the ability to place that expertise in the required location to deliver the service. Quality and upkeep of systems is also important.\n\n**Lower Risk**\n\n* Manufacturing:\n   * Simple, easily trainable, or automated process to produce the good.\n   * Ubiquitous and cheap raw materials.\n   * Stable, short supply chains.\n* Services:\n   * Dealing with well-established and trustworthy counterparties\n   * Suitable, readily available expertise\n   * Robust systems\n   * Flexibility of roll-out\n\n**Higher Risk**\n\n* Manufacturing:\n   * Skilled work required to produce the end-good. Few available trained individuals, and/or high turnover of trained individuals.\n   * Volatile pricing of raw materials.\n   * Complex supply chains, potentially with less-reputable counterparties.\n* Services:\n   * Underdeveloped marketplace of counterparties\n   * Lack of skilled individuals\n   * Complex, inflexible systems\n\nThis is a factor I am less confident on \u2013 feedback and further thoughts welcome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## 5. Sales &amp; Marketing Risk, or \"Go to Market\" Risk\n\n*What is the risk of sales and marketing problems?*\n\nSales and Marketing are key to a successful business. No sales = no revenue. No marketing = potentially limited sales and growth. These terms are often wrapped up in a \u201cgo-to-market strategy\u201d, which encompasses the step-by-step plan a business follows to successfully launch a product into the market. This is summarised nicely in four steps by [Vendasta](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/go-to-market-strategy/) and includes researching target markets, product viability, and product demand, planning the product development roadmap, creating a marketing and pricing strategy, and delivering a positive customer experience. The number of elements at play here can make it difficult for us to distill the key risk factors.\n\nFor Sales Risk, I quote from [Analyst Prep](https://analystprep.com/cfa-level-1-exam/corporate-finance/leverage-business-risk-sales-risk-operating-risk-financial-risk/) with regards to the CFA 2019 Level I Exam curriculum:\n\n&gt;The uncertainty associated with the price and quantity of goods and services is referred to as sales risk. It is affected by demand for a company\u2019s product as well as the price per unit of the product.\n\nSales risk can be associated with certain parts of the sales plan (e.g. regional / international sales) or the whole pipeline. Risks may take the form of poor leads, low customer awareness, high customer churn, shifting customer needs, lack of marketing expertise/people within the business, limited sales channels, better competitors, or negative economic conditions (e.g. recession). Additionally, a business may become dependent on a small number of products, geographies, or clients for revenue (concentration risk) and find it difficult to expand further.\n\nMarketing Risk is the risk that marketing is unsuccessful and ultimately incurs losses. Marketing includes advertising, events branding, partnering with businesses, and other brand-building activity. Inherent in marketing is market research and the need for a business to know its customers. Successful marketing will result in further sales. Unsuccessful marketing will fail to add to or will reduce sales. Failure could entail a lack of demand materialization, but also damage to the company\u2019s brand.\n\nI believe that [Financial Risk](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062415/what-are-major-categories-financial-risk-company.asp), or the risk that the business will be unable to generate suitable revenues, cut costs, or finance itself to breakeven, would also be considered under this factor.\n\n**Lower Risk**\n\n* Management has established links in the market.\n* Large, growing, and accessible addressable market.\n* Strong brand identity / has demonstrated successful marketing.\n* Cheap marketing options.\n* Customers are (likely to be) sticky.\n* Product is not culturally sensitive (can translate to new markets with ease).\n* Costs are controllable (high margin product).\n\n**Higher Risk**\n\n* Me-too brands exist.\n* Lack of sales experience in the team.\n* Cannot demonstrate knowledge of customers.\n* Small addressable and/or difficult to access market.\n* High customer churn / low customer loyalty.\n\nThe Risk Factor Summation Method does not apply a weighting to different factors, and would quickly become very complex if it did. However, the way I interpret this factors means there are many crucial elements that should be carefully considered. Let me know if you think any of these elements should be considered under different factors, or conversely if you think any more should be included here. Note that I have tried to steer clear of competitive edge as that will come in a later factor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nThat concludes the second part of the RSF Method overview. Again, I look forward to constructive discussion and criticism. We will kick off part 3 with the next risk factor, Funding / Capital Raising Risk.",

        "selftext": "[Link to Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ntldw6/lets_discuss_the_risk_factor_summation_valuation/)\n\nFollowing on from Part 1, which was a brief introduction to the RSF Method for valuing seed and early-stage start-up companies, here we will start to dive into the underlying risk factors in the RSF Framework and try to identify examples of Lower Risk or Higher Risk traits.\n\nPlease comment your thoughts on the below. A note before diving in that no start-up will have all Lower Risk or all Higher Risk traits - each will bring its own idiosyncracies. Higher Risk traits do not necessarily correlate with a bad business/idea, just as Lower Risk traits do not signify that a business will be a success.\n\n## Addressing Feedback\n\nI will briefly address feedback to Part 1, but please skip to Management Risk if this is not of interest. Comments mostly focused on what the model is suitable for rather than how it worked.\n\nIn summary, this overview is written from the perspective of a retail investor looking to invest in early-stage companies without the networks, access to founders, and sourcing tools of an institutional VC or angel investor. Therefore, I will make reference to the RSF as a \u201cFramework\u201d to aid thinking rather than a valuation methodology. Typically, retail investors without significant capital would invest through crowdsourcing platforms and have zero say in the valuation of the start-up and may not have the chance to meet a founder face-to-face and delve into a company\u2019s IP. As a result, retail investors may use the RSF framework primarily to consider the overall riskiness of a company, rather than a target valuation, though an insight into valuation would still be provided and help inform the final investment decision. However, it\u2019s still useful to understand how the method was intended to work, which is what I covered in Part 1.\n\n**Suitability for evaluating public / post-revenue companies:** this method would not be suitable for valuing more mature companies, both in public and private markets, as many other data points (e.g. earnings) can be used for valuing late-stage or mature companies. However, some of the risks described by the RSF are universal for all companies and so this post may still be helpful to engage with.\n\n**A non-institutional approach:** it was suggested that the way different VC\u2019s value start-ups is subjective, and also that the RSF Valuation Method is less likely to be used by institutional venture capitalists and seed investors. I do not disagree with these points, but will respond that professional investors have the ability to interview founders and gain private access to the company\u2019s IP, which is often not available to retail investors. Retail investors without significant capital will typically invest through crowdsourcing platforms (e.g. StartEngine, Wefunder, Seedrs, Crowdcube) and have less information to make a decision on. Retail investors using these platforms also have to deal with a pre-determined valuation and I hypothesise that most companies would therefore be \u201covervalued\u201d, as the power to set terms (i.e. how much equity to give away and at what price) rests strongly with the company and not the retail investors. Therefore, retail investors cannot use the same approach as institutional VCs and angel investors and a framework for properly evaluating investment opportunities is critical.\n\n**\u201cI am skeptical of any founder and management of start-ups that cannot raise smart money through angel and VC funds.\u201d** This is a great argument in support of developing a robust evaluation method. Although some founders turn to crowdsourcing for honest reasons, I am sure many do so to avoid more stringent due diligence (especially regarding financials) that they would face from an institutional VC. We should be aware that investing in start-ups is high risk, that retail investors likely face more selection risk than institutional VCs due to lack of data/transparency (which is true of most asset classes), and that retail investors need to be careful in allocating capital to start-ups. Target companies should be high conviction, and the resulting portfolio should be well diversified with many small bets. An allocation to seed-stage businesses should also be appropriately sized within a well diversified total portfolio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## 1. Management Risk\n\n*What is the risk imposed by the current business management team?*\n\nVenture Capitalists constantly throw around fun words to describe what they look for in a founding team. Courage... Determination... Grit... Chutzpah... Spunk? Management Risk is often considered the most important risk of those considered in the RSF Valuation Method and thus should be carefully considered.  Through my reading, I've suggested some ideas of what would lower management risk, and what might increase it.\n\n**Lower Risk**\n\n* Founders with *Courage* (not giving up in the face of adversity; determined to succeed; can learn from mistakes) and *Genius* (groundbreaking ideas; a visionary way of thinking). Other important traits: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management, ambition, and entrepreneurialism.\n* Relevant backgrounds and expertise, including diversity of experience and thought.\n* Management with experience founding and successfully exiting start-ups, especially in the target sector/industry.\n* Strong alignment, i.e. working on the business full-time.\n* Access to strong advisors.\n* Willing to partner with investors.\n\n**Higher Risk**\n\n* Founders who are short-sighted, sweat the small stuff excessively, are hot-headed / of ill-temperament, and opposites of the lower risk traits.\n* Co-founders or other leaders leaving in the early stages of the company\u2019s life (caveat: there may be situations where this is healthy for the business, e.g. if causing friction within management).\n* Lack of relevant experience.\n* New to the start-up environment.\n* Team still to be built out.\n* Unclear responsibilities.\n* Lack of alignment, i.e. splitting focus by working on other business projects.\n\nThis is an easier risk factor to understand. While it can be harder as an individual investor to gain insight into management without meeting the founders and/or management team, taking advantage of webinars or fundraise pitch calls to see the leadership in action and using sources like LinkedIn to evaluate prior experience can be invaluable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## 2. Stage of the Business\n\n*How mature is the business and what is the inherent risk of failure?*\n\nIt is an unspoken understanding that a lot of start-ups fail. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp) covers the reasons why quite well, with the statistic that U.S. start-up [failure rates in 2019](https://www.national.biz/2019-small-business-failure-rate-startup-statistics-industry/) were around 90%. 2020 saw the same 90% rate, and this and a lot of other cool statistics were reported by [Review42](https://review42.com/resources/what-percentage-of-startups-fail/) in Feb 2021.\n\nWe accept that the nature of start-ups brings an inherently high failure rate. So how do we apply a score from +2 to -2? There are a couple of ideas below, but Redditors should chip in with further examples here, or suggest whether these traits belong under other factors:\n\n**Lower Risk**\n\n* Prototype developed, tested, and proven to work.\n* Market validation, i.e. first customers acquired and sales made.\n* Employee headcount growing.\n* Strategic relationships developed, e.g. joint ventures, marketing alliances, licensing arrangements, selling/distribution, etc.\n\n**Higher Risk**\n\n* Prototype not developed, i.e. still in the concept phase.\n* No demonstration of product-market fit.\n* Low headcount beyond founders, or limited growth.\n\nWhile it is easy to tar every start-up with a thick brush labeled \"-2\", we should remember that start-ups must be judged relative to one another and to their industry. Therefore, we should be conscious of how companies may be marked up, as well as down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## 3. Legislation / Political Risk\n\n*Will politics or regulation hamper business growth?*\n\nThis can be difficult to judge and I welcome other's views on this. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/politicalrisk.asp) again offers a good overview as to the inherent difficulties in quantifying this risk factor:\n\n&gt;Political risk is the risk an investment's returns could suffer as a result of political changes or instability in a country. Instability affecting investment returns could stem from a change in government, legislative bodies, other foreign policymakers or military control. Political risk is also known as \"geopolitical risk,\" and becomes more of a factor as the time horizon of investment gets longer. They are considered a type of [jurisdiction risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jurisdiction-risk.asp).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Political risks are notoriously hard to quantify because there are limited sample sizes or case studies when discussing an individual nation. Some political risks can be insured against through international agencies or other government bodies. The outcome of political risk could drag down investment returns or even go so far as to remove the ability to withdraw capital from an investment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lower Risk**\n\n* Governments aligned with the objectives of the business (e.g. the recent impetus for green energy and reduction for climate impact).\n* Operating in countries with stable political processes and leadership.\n* Government unlikely to interfere with the business or its management team, including in the case of M&amp;A activity.\n\n**Higher Risk**\n\n* Government (positioned to start) implementing legislation making business operations more challenging.\n* Operating in countries with volatile legislative and political frameworks\n* Government can interfere with business operations.\n\nAn example of government being well aligned with business objectives is the recent impetus for green energy and reduction for climate impact, especially in Europe and increasingly in the US, which provides incentives for or decreases the legislative risk to green-focused start-ups. An example of a government interfering with business can be seen in the recent [China-Ant Group / Jack Ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_Group#Backlash_from_regulators) situation which resulted in a highly anticipated $34 billion IPO being halted. I would love to hear more risks and examples for this section, and whether you think I\u2019m hitting the right areas, as it is a more difficult factor to quantify.\n\nRegarding disruptive technology, which is often seen in early-stage companies, it may be the case that a start-up is among the first in the birth of a new industry. In time, this may lead to new and novel regulation. An example is how politicians and central banks are increasingly taking note of blockchain technology and related cryptocurrencies. If disrupted sectors are important to the government or other agents (e.g. the financial industry and national currencies), regulation may be applied harder/more tightly and previously innovative companies may be stifled. Conversely, a new industry showing great opportunity for society may be encouraged to grow.\n\nWhich leads me to something to bear in mind: not all regulation is bad, and not all de-regulation is good. Kate Raworth makes an excellent point in her book Doughnut Economics on how de-regulation is really just \"re-regulation\" anyway. An example once given during a panel on Machine Learning &amp; AI at the Royal Society highlighted that it was only once regulation regarding privacy and restricting the use of cameras on drones in [Sweden](https://uavcoach.com/drone-laws-in-sweden/) did drone innovation really take off in the country. The rules must be known before the game can be properly played. I offer this only as a counter-example to the commonly held belief that de-regulation or an unregulated environment is always the best environment for a business to operate in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## 4. Manufacturing Risk or Service Delivery Risk\n\n*Could the business fail to produce products or deliver a service?*\n\nA brilliant management team and an excellent market environment mean nothing if the supply chain or ability to provide a service is unavailable. In 2020, UK-EU relations made headlines as the ability for the UK and Europe to share supply chains to produce COVID-19 vaccines fell to implicit and explicit threats on each side that access to raw materials could be shut off if vaccines were not shared equitably. There are elements of Political and International risk in this scenario, but the point is that if a company does not have the raw materials required to produce its good, or the channels available through which to deliver its service, then it is going to have a hard time producing any revenues.\n\nManufacturing risk can cover not just the ability to consistently obtain necessary raw materials at an attractive and stable price point but also maintaining the necessary equipment and the relevant expertise within a company to produce an end-product of suitable quality from those materials.\n\nService Delivery Risk I believe has two angles. One is services the business owner requires to run their business. The other is the ability to provide a service to their customers. For the first, an example would be [counterparty risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp), and is the risk that one party will not make good on its end of the agreement. This is more likely to be a problem in times of financial stress as various measures are often put in place to mitigate this risk in more normal economic times. For the second, this is typically people-driven and can include having the right expertise available and the ability to place that expertise in the required location to deliver the service. Quality and upkeep of systems is also important.\n\n**Lower Risk**\n\n* Manufacturing:\n   * Simple, easily trainable, or automated process to produce the good.\n   * Ubiquitous and cheap raw materials.\n   * Stable, short supply chains.\n* Services:\n   * Dealing with well-established and trustworthy counterparties\n   * Suitable, readily available expertise\n   * Robust systems\n   * Flexibility of roll-out\n\n**Higher Risk**\n\n* Manufacturing:\n   * Skilled work required to produce the end-good. Few available trained individuals, and/or high turnover of trained individuals.\n   * Volatile pricing of raw materials.\n   * Complex supply chains, potentially with less-reputable counterparties.\n* Services:\n   * Underdeveloped marketplace of counterparties\n   * Lack of skilled individuals\n   * Complex, inflexible systems\n\nThis is a factor I am less confident on \u2013 feedback and further thoughts welcome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## 5. Sales &amp; Marketing Risk, or \"Go to Market\" Risk\n\n*What is the risk of sales and marketing problems?*\n\nSales and Marketing are key to a successful business. No sales = no revenue. No marketing = potentially limited sales and growth. These terms are often wrapped up in a \u201cgo-to-market strategy\u201d, which encompasses the step-by-step plan a business follows to successfully launch a product into the market. This is summarised nicely in four steps by [Vendasta](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/go-to-market-strategy/) and includes researching target markets, product viability, and product demand, planning the product development roadmap, creating a marketing and pricing strategy, and delivering a positive customer experience. The number of elements at play here can make it difficult for us to distill the key risk factors.\n\nFor Sales Risk, I quote from [Analyst Prep](https://analystprep.com/cfa-level-1-exam/corporate-finance/leverage-business-risk-sales-risk-operating-risk-financial-risk/) with regards to the CFA 2019 Level I Exam curriculum:\n\n&gt;The uncertainty associated with the price and quantity of goods and services is referred to as sales risk. It is affected by demand for a company\u2019s product as well as the price per unit of the product.\n\nSales risk can be associated with certain parts of the sales plan (e.g. regional / international sales) or the whole pipeline. Risks may take the form of poor leads, low customer awareness, high customer churn, shifting customer needs, lack of marketing expertise/people within the business, limited sales channels, better competitors, or negative economic conditions (e.g. recession). Additionally, a business may become dependent on a small number of products, geographies, or clients for revenue (concentration risk) and find it difficult to expand further.\n\nMarketing Risk is the risk that marketing is unsuccessful and ultimately incurs losses. Marketing includes advertising, events branding, partnering with businesses, and other brand-building activity. Inherent in marketing is market research and the need for a business to know its customers. Successful marketing will result in further sales. Unsuccessful marketing will fail to add to or will reduce sales. Failure could entail a lack of demand materialization, but also damage to the company\u2019s brand.\n\nI believe that [Financial Risk](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062415/what-are-major-categories-financial-risk-company.asp), or the risk that the business will be unable to generate suitable revenues, cut costs, or finance itself to breakeven, would also be considered under this factor.\n\n**Lower Risk**\n\n* Management has established links in the market.\n* Large, growing, and accessible addressable market.\n* Strong brand identity / has demonstrated successful marketing.\n* Cheap marketing options.\n* Customers are (likely to be) sticky.\n* Product is not culturally sensitive (can translate to new markets with ease).\n* Costs are controllable (high margin product).\n\n**Higher Risk**\n\n* Me-too brands exist.\n* Lack of sales experience in the team.\n* Cannot demonstrate knowledge of customers.\n* Small addressable and/or difficult to access market.\n* High customer churn / low customer loyalty.\n\nThe Risk Factor Summation Method does not apply a weighting to different factors, and would quickly become very complex if it did. However, the way I interpret this factors means there are many crucial elements that should be carefully considered. Let me know if you think any of these elements should be considered under different factors, or conversely if you think any more should be included here. Note that I have tried to steer clear of competitive edge as that will come in a later factor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nThat concludes the second part of the RSF Method overview. Again, I look forward to constructive discussion and criticism. We will kick off part 3 with the next risk factor, Funding / Capital Raising Risk.",

I have no affiliation with any company mentioned in this post.*\n\n(3 minute read)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n//\n\nOn January 16th, 2009, Obama was getting prepared to be sworn in.  His first order of business was to stabilize the American economy that the finance industry almost *destroyed*.  People all over the world had lost much of their life savings because of Wall Street's greed.\n\nAfter stimulus passed, the administration started to work on their first major legislative policy.\n\nIt was healthcare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n//\n\n**On that same day in 2009, UnitedHealth (UNH) was trading at $25.50 with a market cap of $23B.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zkh5gwhks3471.png?width=1342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2aa3a04e6955c634e17b8743935e14faa9ff7ce2\n\nThe Obama administration ended up passing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on March 23rd, 2010.  The ACA has dramatically changed the US healthcare system.  Now that it's survived both Democratic and Republican administrations, it will continue to spark more change long-term.  The ACA gives Medicare the power to change payment models in a way that moves the entire industry away from \"fee-for-service\" (FFS) to \"value-based care\".  It does this by giving the private sector huge financial incentives to improve outcomes.\n\nSince the ACA passed, UnitedHealth (UNH) has grown over 16x to a market cap of over $380B.  The Medicare market is what has primarily driven UNH's growth.  They are the largest Medicare Advantage (MA) insurer in the US, with 26% market share.  Much of that growth has been through the acquisition of MA plans in local markets all over the country.\n\n# \n\n# CLOV ISN'T JUST A SHORT-TERM PLAY.\n\n16x growth is the opportunity Clover Health (CLOV) has *AFTER* a short squeeze.  It's one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market.  With the support of retail investors, they can use their elevated stock price as an asset to go on a series of acquisitions that create real business value.  This growth will support an even higher stock price.  It's a virtuous cycle.  Whenever shorts come in, it will just lead to another step-change in stock price and even faster expansion for CLOV.\n\nHealthcare providers and insurers have stable revenue streams, making it straightforward to [finance their acquisition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition-financing).  UNH has already proven this [playbook](https://www.dukece.com/optumcare-biggest-health-care-system-never-heard/) over the past 10 years.  *It's right in front of us.*  We can replicate it, and with a strong retail backing, CLOV can execute this same playbook in an even shorter time period.  The retail revolution has arrived at the exact same time that there is massive disruption (i.e. opportunity) in the healthcare industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# RETAIL INVESTORS NOW HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE LONG-TERM WINNERS, NOT JUST BEAT SHORT SELLERS.\n\nCLOV is perfectly positioned to replicate the UNH playbook and beat them at their own game.  CLOV has run Medicare Advantage (MA) plans for over seven years.  They've been able to take more and more market share away from UNH and other large competitors each year.  That's made them one of the [fastest-growing](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/about-us/press/clover-health-triples-geographic-footprint) MA plans.  The most amazing part is that it's been entirely organic growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith more retail investors, they can rapidly launch and/or acquire new MA plans in geographies that they're not currently in.  They also have the Clover Assistant, a software platform that providers use to improve health outcomes.  With their [Direct Contracting Entity (DCE)](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/cms-direct-contracting-model---is-it-still-one-of-the-value-based-models-built-on-fee-for-service-chasis-), CLOV can acquire provider organizations around the country and take on full-risk with them.  They could rapidly become one of the largest payvidors in the US.\n\nThe future of US healthcare will be dominated by payvidors.  It's a combination of a payor (i.e. insurance company) and provider (i.e. doctor).  It's [powerful](https://www.dukece.com/optumcare-biggest-health-care-system-never-heard/) because you can take on and manage risk as a payor, and directly control cost and quality on the provider side.  Kaiser Permanente has proven out this model in the US for decades now.  UNH has become the ultimate example of a payvidor, growing from an insurer 10 years ago to the [largest employer of physicians](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/now-what-imminent-dangers-and-emerging-opportunities-physicians) in the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# THIS IS THE NEXT STAGE OF EVOLUTION IN THE RETAIL REVOLUTION.\n\nGME and AMC have been amazing trips so far.  On days that they squeeze, they really are like trips to the moon.  The problem with these companies though, is that they eventually come back to Earth.  I can't see a future where *more* people going to be buying and selling video games at stores, or going to movie theaters.\n\nCLOV is like going to the moon (short squeeze), building a permanent base with a launch site (business growth), and then going to Mars (business growth + future squeezes).\n\nI will continue to support (i.e. hodl) GME and AMC because of what they have meant to us.  They've given us a voice that Wall Street can't ignore.  Nothing changed after 2009.  Now we're making them change.  As the retail investor movement grows, I hope we can also support companies that are positioned for future growth.\n\n*If we could do that, we might just take control of this entire game.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n//\n\nNote:\n\nThis thesis isn't specific to CLOV or healthcare.  I truly believe retail investors can create massive value for all companies and industries positioned for growth.  I just know healthcare, and see a [proven model](https://www.dukece.com/optumcare-biggest-health-care-system-never-heard/) that can be replicated by a great company that also happens to be highly shorted.\n\nCopied from r/CLOV",

        "selftext": "BBIG: The Next Gamma Squeeze\n\nThis DD is a work in progress so bear with me.\n\n**Catalyst**: \n\nBBIG is currently undergoing a merger with Zash (who has a controlling stake in Lomotif). According to the latest update by the company, they anticipate that the Gemini Valuation Services will complete and present to Vinco an independent third party valuation on Zash on or before June 11th.\n\n**What is Zash**: \n\nThe entertainment industry disrupter led by co-founders Ted Farnsworth, financier and former MoviePass Chairman, early Musical.ly (now TikTok) investor Jaeson Ma, and early Triller visionary and board member, Vincent Butta, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a majority controlling interest in Lomotif Private Limited (\u201cLomotif\u201d), the Singapore-based top video-sharing social networking platform and budding rival to TikTok, and Kuaishou\n\nWhy you should care: The valuation of ByteDance (which owns TikTok) came in at close to 250$ billion in the private market. Up from the previously listed 140$ billion: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-30/bytedance-is-said-valued-at-250-billion-in-private-trades#:\\~:text=%2B2.00%2B0.32%25-,Shares%20of%20ByteDance%20Ltd.%2C%20the%20Chinese%20parent%20of%20hit%20video,people%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-30/bytedance-is-said-valued-at-250-billion-in-private-trades#:~:text=%2B2.00%2B0.32%25-,Shares%20of%20ByteDance%20Ltd.%2C%20the%20Chinese%20parent%20of%20hit%20video,people%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter).\n\nBBIG currently trades at close to 120 million in market cap. If the Lomotif valuation comes even at a fraction of the Tik Tok valuation (and these high growth tech start ups tend to come with a bigger valuation) the upside potential has not even been close to realized. Even a billion dollar valuation (a shadow in comparison to TikTok) would be enough to 5-10x the stock price.\n\n**Big Players:** \n\nZack Morris announced close to a $2 million dollar position in this stock according to his Twitter. His twitter followers have flooded to take up shares as well.\n\nInstitutional ownership has been increasing over the course of the past two months with clear buys and limited to no selling: [https://fintel.io/so/us/bbig#:\\~:text=Institutional%20Ownership%20and%20Shareholders,Securities%20Exchange%20Commission%20(SEC).&amp;text=Major%20shareholders%20can%20include%20individual,%2C%20hedge%20funds%2C%20or%20institutions](https://fintel.io/so/us/bbig#:~:text=Institutional%20Ownership%20and%20Shareholders,Securities%20Exchange%20Commission%20(SEC).&amp;text=Major%20shareholders%20can%20include%20individual,%2C%20hedge%20funds%2C%20or%20institutions).\n\n**Gamma Squeeze Potential**: \n\nThere has been a dramatic increase in the amount of short dated contracts expiring around 5$. A recent photo circulated on Twitter of the options activity has 316,000 calls to 7,000 puts. A continued increase of this activity and institutions that underwrite these options will have to buy shares to cover the short positions thus creating a \u2018squeeze\u2019 we saw with AMC.\n\n**To Sum/TL;DR:** \n\nValuation news is set to come out at some point next week. While it won\u2019t come close to TikTok, if it even grabs a fraction of the market share there is no saying how high it could go. -Big players are currently loading the stock in these ranges. From big institutional investors to well-known stock traders. -If the options activity continues (with more people buying short dated options) this might in turn generate a Gamma Squeeze of epic proportions.\n\nI am currently long at 3.19. \n\n**As always, this is not financial advice and do your own DD.**",

I remember when Justin Beiber was \"discovered\" on Youtube when youtube wasnt really a household name.\n\nSo when I read [headlines like this](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lomotif-partners-with-grammy-award-winning-producer-teddy-riley-launches-fan-based-user-generated-ugc-global-talent-search-youve-been-scouted-301293928.html) I know that these apps are going to be a cash cow for ad-revenue and if $BBIG owns Lomotif, they are the ones seeing that kickback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe data speaks for itself:\n\n&gt; with 225+ million installations of the Lomotif app globally in over 200 countries in 300+ languages. Over 300 million videos are watched on the platform per month and over 10 billion atomic clips (User Generated Content (UGC)) have been used to create more than 750 million videos on the platform since its launch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther fun take-aways and confirmation bias:\n\n \n\n&gt;The co-founders of ZASH behind this deal are former **MoviePass** chairman Ted Farnsworth, early Musical.ly, now under the name TikTok, investor Jaeson Ma, and **Triller** Board Member Vincent Butta.\n\n \n\n&gt;The merger between Vinco Ventures and ZASH, as well as ZASH acquiring Lomotif, is set to take place at the same time.\n\n***The most important:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;When the merger between Vinco Ventures and ZASH closes, this will have Lomotif owned by a public company in the U.S.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\n:rocket: :moon: M&amp;A company $BBIG is doing its thing with ZASH and they're competing with TikTok through a Singapore based app called Lomotif, *and doing damn well so far,* with celebrity endorsements and backing.\n\nImportant Dates: Today, (6-11-21), (June 24th, 2021), and (July 15th, 2021)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObligatory: Not your Financial Advisor and this is not financial advice to buy the stock. I like the stock and the companies. I think the revenue growth potential is there (and is already established through current holdings) BUT invest at your own risk, etc. etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFun fact: My wife works at the outside law firm listed on $BBIG's website. I will not say anymore\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee you autists on the moon July 15th",
