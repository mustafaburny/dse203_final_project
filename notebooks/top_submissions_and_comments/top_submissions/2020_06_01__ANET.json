        "selftext": "I'm thinking of signing up for Motley Fool's new 5G recommendation service, and splitting the cost with [u/GRITxGRIND](https://www.reddit.com/user/GRITxGRIND/). We're looking to split the cost with anyone else who is interested in investing in 5G. It's called \"Next-Gen Supercycle\" which was $1,299 for a year , but now they're offering it for $799 for 6 months. So if someone joins us and we split it 3 ways, it's $266 each and we'd all get the recommendations.\n\nThe 5G recommendations are called \"Next-Gen Supercycle\", and it includes recommendations about companies that would get massive growth from 5G phones and other connected devices, as well as semiconductor suppliers in the 5G supply chain, micro-cap companies involved in connected and self-driving cars, and companies that would get a boost from 5G infrastructure to build the networks and cell sites. Apparently Motley Fool reviewed over 900 companies and narrowed it down to 19 stock ideas as well as future recommendations and an example portfolio section designed around 5G.\n\nSo far, I've had great returns from Motley Fool's \"Stock Advisor\" recommendations. In the last 2 months, I'm up +11% on ANET, +13% on CRM, +16% on ETSY, +19% on SHOP, +23% on OKTA, +27% on TEAM, +41% on TTD, and +64% on SFIX. Also +4.85% on ACN after just a week. I realize most of these gains are due to the general market improving, but the companies they recommend are vetted to stay successful for the next 3-5 years. For those not familiar, Motley Fool focuses on growth stocks. Motley Fool gives themselves a bad rep with the free articles that sound like they're written by interns, and the hype-filled ads, but once you actually pay you get decent research and stock recommendations that actually beat the market.\n\nSo if you're interested in investing in 5G companies, and want to get recommendations from Motley Fool, let me know and I'll give you access to all the 5G recommendations and research. I can keep you posted on recommendations from their $199 Stock Advisor service too.\n\nIf you're an investor who doesn't like 5G or the idea of investing in it, please don't reply here and post your thoughts elsewhere. Also, if your opinion on Motley Fool is based only on reading their awful free clickbait articles, don't bother starting an argument here. Thanks!",
