Market expectations are for .5% or more cut.  \n\nI know the last rate cut rally didn't last much longer than a stick of Zebra Stripe gum, but don't underestimate J. Powell's ability to retard the fuck out of this opportunity. They're gonna throw the fucking kitchen sink at this.\n\nAll that to say, it's very possible he disappoints markets again and we make mad tendies, but there's also a fair chance there's another day long bullshit rally to rip the face off your puts. \n\nBefore you go dumb fucking yourself on super short term PUTs just remembe their announcement to be made at 2PM EST Wednesday.\n\n\n[Forecast survey: Expect Fed to slash interest rates near zero in 2020 to battle coronavirus fallout](https://www.bankrate.com/surveys/federal-reserve-forecast-survey-march-2020/amp/)\n\n\nTLDR: Fed Meeting Wednesday, careful on short term puts, especially SPY.",
