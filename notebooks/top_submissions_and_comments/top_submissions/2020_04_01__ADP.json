        "selftext": "First and foremost I am an average investor. Nothing fancy, and around half a year of options experience and I am also very bearish. Technical analysis obviously has some truth to it, it's a tool to allow more accurate decision making but is not an oracle which is why I wanted to question one of the points that continuously get brought up - **volume**. Before the black swan event SPY traded at 50million average, now it's at around 130 million average. Given that there hasn't been extreme bearish news lately, wouldn't it be normal for SPY to be trading at a lower volume? The way I see it SPY shouldn't have increased volume unless there is a reason to, for example - a large GDP decrease, unexpected terrible earnings, a major country going under a 2nd lockdown, mass bankruptcy or extending lockdowns even further. I do believe DOW will decrease in the future but unless a major event happens, I don't see why SPY would gap down a lot within 2-6 weeks since there is also a good chance none of those examples will happen in that timeframe. Insight would be much appreciated.  \n\n\nIWM 7/17 100P, SPY300 5/15",

        "selftext": "01:00 PM EDT, 04/28/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Zoom Video Communications (ZM) picked Oracle's (ORCL) cloud platform to support the surge in demand for its product from both consumers and companies as the COVID-19 pandemic drove people into their homes to stem the spread of the respiratory disease.\n\nThe company said in a statement on Tuesday that it needed immediate additional cloud capacity after seeing daily meeting participants spike to 300 million this month, up 50% from March. Zoom had about 10 million free and paid users by the end of December last year, it said earlier this month.\n\n\"We recently experienced the most significant growth our business has ever seen, requiring massive increases in our service capacity,\" said Eric Yuan, Zoom's chief executive. \"We chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure because of its industry-leading security, outstanding performance, and unmatched level of support.\"\n\nZoom's operations have gained attention during the pandemic as users sheltering in their homes signed up for the video platform to connect with coworkers, family and friends. More than 212,000 people have died and 3.06 million have fallen ill from the respiratory disease.\n\nThe stock has surged 134% this year as the outbreak grew, although the shares were 2.8% lower on Tuesday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite turned lower.\n\nYuan said earlier this month it was shifting engineering resources to trust, safety and privacy issues after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it received reports of video conferences being interrupted by hate images, pornography and threats. Last week, Zoom released an upgrade to its program that included \"robust security enhancements.\"\n\nZoom said it's now enabling \"millions\" of meeting participants on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which will help it meet the changing demands of a growing customer base.\n\n\"Video communications has become an essential part of our professional and personal lives, and Zoom has led this industry's innovation,\" said Safra Catz, Oracle's chief executive.\n\nPrice: 159.30, Change: -5.30, Percent Change: -3.22",
