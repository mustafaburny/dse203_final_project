So I recently bought some large cap growth companies to hopefully smooth things out. Of course, the gods of Wall Street were keenly interested in my orders of 1-2 shares which prompted an immediate sell-off of everything I bought. \n\nI clearly brought my curse with me to these innocent companies. For this reason, I apologize to all the other holders of these companies' shares. My current returns:\n\n* AAPL -3.6%\n* NVDA -4.1%\n* ADBE -3.1%\n* TGT  -2.5%\n* CCI  -5.2%",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 3, 2021**\n\nStocks finished the day mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) falling while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pushed higher, closing 0.31% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.46%. Market participants are digesting the release of the August Jobs Report, which showed a sharp deceleration in employment amid the latest surge by the coronavirus Delta variant. \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year in continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nThis is a little confusing but follow me here. In a weird quirk of the market, the low employment numbers actually benefit equities by staving off the need for tapering, which is why we saw tech stocks in particular popping today. Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d Regardless, as I have said before, I remain unconcerned by taper talks, I think the real test for equities will come when discussion about potential interest rate hikes begins.\n\nSteve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers, said of the report \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the market really trying to wrestle with the idea of what matters to it more: Is it about the economy, or is it about monetary policy? Now, we\u2019ve been in a monetary-driven market for so long it\u2019s hard to say that monetary factors aren\u2019t at the forefront of the market\u2019s mindset right now. But what I think we may be seeing here \u2026 we can\u2019t really figure out whether this delays tapering in a meaningful way. But there\u2019s stuff in here that is not necessarily bad other than the headline number. Wages are good, the unemployment rate is good.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Moderna (MRNA), Workday (WDAY), Nvidia (NVDA) were among the best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq today, driving it higher.\n* US auto safety regulators disclosed they are investigating a July 26 fatal crash involving a Tesla that may or may not have been using the advanced driver assistance system. This is the latest regulatory headache for Tesla and their autonomous driving technology given there is already another investigation currently underway.\n* Dish\u2019s (DISH) Sling TV, which reportedly has 2.7 million subs as of December 2020, has partnered with Penn National Gaming (PENN) to launch a Barstools Sports Channel on its streaming service. \n* Match Group (MTCH), which owns popular dating app Tinder, filed a letter with Dutch competition regulators to public state their decision regarding a complaint filed against Apple for anti-competitive practices for forcing Match to use Apple\u2019s in-app payment system. Ever since Fortnite-maker Epic Games\u2019 original lawsuit against Apple regarding this seems more and more companies are hopping on. A new South Korean law that was recently passed forces Apple and Google to accept third-party payment systems.\n* Amid regulatory crackdown and a falling stock price, Alibaba (BABA) committed to spending the equivalent of roughly $15.5 billion by 2025 towards the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s drive to \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d. \n* Beyond Meats (BYND) COO Sanjay Shah steps down from his role with no public explanation given. He originally joined the company from Tesla in 2019\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Adobe (ADBE) target raised by Argus from $650 to $764 at Buy. Stock currently around $665\n* Broadcom (AVGO) with a host of target raises. Average price target $550 at Buy. Stock currently around $498\n* DocuSign (DOCU) with a host of target raises.

        "selftext": "How are my fellow Palantards not seeing C3.ai?\n\nFor anyone such as myself who likes Palantir, Snowflake and other data/AI companies, C3.ai is in a great position to be bought right now.\n\nThe company is [led by Thomas Siebel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2020/11/19/on-crm-tom-siebel-is-back-and-hes-working-with-microsoft/?sh=5859683d341f), and while he is kind of older and approaching retirement age, you cannot overlook him. He is the man who invented CRM\u2019s, which are the software such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics that drive most major corporations.\n\nWhat he is doing with this company is creating usable AI for companies, which he likes to repeatedly call \u201cturnkey solutions\u201d. Basically this means it\u2019s AI programs that simpleton operators in big companies can use without any serious coding or programming.\n\nBasically, C3.ai is doing what Palantir does, but their focus is making plug and play programs, instead of relying heavily on forward deployed engineers.\n\nOf course, what really matters here is are these empty promises and big dreams, or does the software actually work?\n\nWell the contracts and partnerships they have developed would certainly suggest that their software friggen works.\n\nThey aren\u2019t doing this work alone, they are partnered with many serious players:\n\n# CRM\u2019s:\n\nTo make AI tools that are usable with CRM\u2019s such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics, they have officially partnered with **Microsoft and Adobe**. Microsoft went a step further and purchased some shares during the IPO last summer.\n\nNote, through their partnership with Microsoft, they are not competing with Salesforce, they are working with Salesforce.\n\nAnd this software is not in development, it just became available.\n\n*Partnership source:* [*https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/26/c3-ai-microsoft-and-adobe-combine-forces-to-re-invent-crm-with-ai/*](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/26/c3-ai-microsoft-and-adobe-combine-forces-to-re-invent-crm-with-ai/)  \n*Launch source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-announces-general-availability-of-c3-ai-crm/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-announces-general-availability-of-c3-ai-crm/)\n\n# Energy:\n\nTo make AI tools that are usable in oil and gas, they partnered with **Baker Hughes**, and that software has been adopted by other oil and gas companies such as **Shell** and MEG. And obviously it works, because after their initial trial, Shell went ahead and renewed their commitment with them for 5 years.\n\n*5 year renewal source:* [*https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-and-Shell-Extend-Strategic-Collaboration-to-Reshape-Global-Energy-and-Resource-Industries-with-Enterprise-AI/default.aspx*](https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-and-Shell-Extend-Strategic-Collaboration-to-Reshape-Global-Energy-and-Resource-Industries-with-Enterprise-AI/default.aspx)\n\n# National Defense:\n\nTo make national defense tools, they are working with both the US Air Force, and the Missile Defence Agency, to create AI tools used for diagnostics on aircraft, and ballistics for a missile defence system.\n\nNote, the Missile Defence Agency has the ambitious goal of creating an advanced system that would protect USA from airborne missile attacks. Basically, they are trying to create an iron dome comparable to what Israel is using to defend itself from Palestinian terrorists.\n\n*MDA source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/)\n\n# Autonomous Packaging:\n\nNow today, they just announced that they have expanded into technology that will obviously be useful in ALL retail. They just signed a deal to help develop autonomous packaging with one of the largest aluminum packaging companies in the world, Ball Corporation, who does $12B in annual revenue at 60 international locations.\n\n*Ball Corporation source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-to-enable-ambitious-sustainability-and-energy-efficiency-goals-with-aluminium-beverage-packaging-category-leader/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Cloud Computing:\n\nC3.ai\u2019s products are now being carried by both **Google Cloud and Snowflake**. Both of those companies are offering C3.ai\u2019s products to their customers to work with their platforms, and both of those companies have an incentive to help sell the product. Google Cloud\u2019s CEO has done a TV interview with C3, stating that they intend to use Google Clouds 2000 person sales team to get people using C3 on google servers.\n\n*Google source:* [*https://c3.ai/google-cloud-and-c3-ai-create-industry-first-alliance-to-accelerate-enterprise-ai/*](https://c3.ai/google-cloud-and-c3-ai-create-industry-first-alliance-to-accelerate-enterprise-ai/)\n\n*Snowflake source:* [*https://c3.ai/c3-ai-and-snowflake-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-enterprise-ai-applications-at-scale/*](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-and-snowflake-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-enterprise-ai-applications-at-scale/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the question is this if these companies and organizations see value in C3\u2019s software, why the hell is it valued so much lower than Palantir and Snowflake:\n\n* Microsoft\n* Google\n* Adobe\n* Shell\n* Baker Hughes\n* US Air Force\n* Missile Defence Agency\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some key fundamental facts:**\n\n* The stock is down 75% from it\u2019s meme mania highs, and looks like it has technically bottomed out.\n* They have $1B of cash on hand, with like a $37M burn rate. They have LOTS of runway.\n* They are actually \u201cstructurally profitable\u201d meaning they have a large margin on their cost of goods sold, but their loss is directly attributable to the money being spent on marketing and sales, which the CEO rightly defends as a smart investment.\n* YOY revenue is up 29% in the last quarter.\n* They operate in the large customer space like Palantir, and their enterprise AI customers grew 85% to 98 in the last quarter. With the recent announcements, they are likely over 100 now.\n\nSource: [https://ir.c3.ai/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx](https://ir.c3.ai/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n# TLDR: If you like Palantir, you should probably be interested in C3.ai as well.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 16, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed in a volatile session after getting a boost following the release of new economic data that showed retail sales for the month of August coming in stronger-than-expected, suggesting that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP, held up despite rising coronavirus Delta variant concerns. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) and Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the day with a gain of 0.07% and 0.08% respectively. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 0.17% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.17% and 0.19% down respectively. Jobless claims also came in near a pandemic-era low. \n\nWith the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. \n\nA few days ago, China\u2019s retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.\n\nIn a new weekly report by Factset, consensus analysts are still looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings growth of nearly 28% for the third quarter. While a deceleration from the more than 80% growth rate posted in the second quarter of this year, that would still mark the third-highest year-over-year increase in earnings for the index since 2010. Third-quarter earnings reporting season is set to pick up next month. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* A host of news coming out of Facebook (FB) after journalists reviewed internal documents from the company. Not going to get into it here, but I recommend you check out was is going on surrounding Facebook.\n* Ford Motors (F) said it plans to boost capacity from the F-150 Lightning pickup truck to 80,000 per year thanks to strong demand, adding that the vehicle would be for sale next spring.\n* Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who has built the company into the US\u2019 most valuable chip maker, was named as one of Time Magazine\u2019s 100 Most Influential People. I have said this publicly multiple times, but NVDA is my single favorite stock in the entire market.\n* Lucid\u2019s (LCID) luxury sedan has received a government certification for a range of 520 miles. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it\u2019s the longest range EV rated so far. For comparisons, Tesla\u2019s Model S was rated for a range of 405 miles, though it is a lot cheaper. \n* Match Group (MTCH), which operates popular dating app Tinder, said it was working on its own payment system to circumvent Apple and Google following the recent decision by US authorities to allow companies to offer third-party payment solutions within the Google and Apple app stores. \n* Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) said it aims for net-zero emissions within the next 30 years. \n* Popular chatting platform Discord raised $500 million in a new founding round, bringing the value of the company to an estimated $15 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) originally tried to buy Discord many months ago, but it seems like the company is aiming to go public at some point. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices.\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $310 to $395 at Buy.

        "selftext": "We know software/newer tech sort of follows the Amazon playbook of growth at all costs without showing profits till later, so we can start by valuing it at price to sales.  Salesforce was always sort of a wall street hype stock, when they hit a $100B market cap around 06/2018, they had $11B in annual Rev and $3.6B per quarter for a 8 price to sales.  In fact in all their years public they never really broke through a 11 p/s ratio and to their credit, like ADBE, AMZN and other successful companies they actually grew into their valuations.\n\nSNOW is almost at $100B with $270 mil per quarter.  Price to sales is around 100.  See the problem?\n\nOthers:\n\nBILL - $28B market - 110 p/s\n\nDDOG - $44B market - 55 p/s\n\nZS - $37B - 60 p/s\n\nOKTA - $39B - 33 p/s\n\nCRWD, COUP, SHOP, MDB, DOCU, DOCS, NET, MNDY, TEAM, U, etc\n\nThere are plenty more.. Zoom peaked in Oct of 2020 at a \\~70 p/s and has been on a downslide since then. \n\nI think we\u2019re a quarter of two away from a major crash in software. The pump can\u2019t go on forever.  \n\nBuyer beware, if you\u2019re short, hang in there!",

I am still scared but luckily I found a server in [r/jts\\_trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/jts_trading/) that has helped me out a lot and calmed my nerves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout further ado, my plan so far with this account is daytrades in stocks and advanced options daytrades and swings. I did two daytrades in HLBZ in the beginning of the week which netted me about $250 on Day 1 which was nice.\n\n[Stock daytrades this week](https://preview.redd.it/cexp78nebhp71.jpg?width=320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2bb2150c4ec0168281020b4decfcaedfd65af39)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other trades I entered were advanced options swings in NKE, SPY, and ADBE which gave me the bulk of my gains this week.\n\n[Week one recap](https://preview.redd.it/d7ln6gugbhp71.jpg?width=740&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4053612cba23bf15bf09e28f6e8f4c283fac8225)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am sticking to my rules of only daytrading momentum stocks while also doing advanced options trading in the meantime. Position sizing is based on how much I am willing to lose per trade which is $250. I did this for HLBZ entering at $34 for 100 shares and selling at about $36.",

Salesforce was always sort of a wall street hype stock, when they hit a $100B market cap around 06/2018, they had $11B in annual Rev and $3.6B per quarter for a 8 price to sales.  In fact in all their years public they never really broke through a 11 p/s ratio and to their credit, like ADBE, AMZN and other successful companies they actually grew into their valuations.\n\nSNOW is almost at $100B with $270 mil per quarter.  Price to sales is around 100.  See the problem?\n\nOthers:\n\nBILL - $28B market - 110 p/s\n\nDDOG - $44B market - 55 p/s\n\nZS - $37B - 60 p/s\n\nOKTA - $39B - 33 p/s\n\nCRWD, COUP, SHOP, MDB, DOCU, DOCS, NET, MNDY, TEAM, U, etc\n\nThere are plenty more.. Zoom peaked in Oct of 2020 at a \\~70 p/s and has been on a downslide since then. \n\nI think we\u2019re s quarter of two away from a major crash in software. The pump can\u2019t go on forever.  \n\nBuyer beware, shorts hang in there!",

        "selftext": "This is an unplanned supplement to my prior DD on the eve of Rocket Lab\u2019s de-spac. \n\nI had dozens of comments listing key points/catalysts that I had initially missed, because I was keen on being the first to post a legal DD about rocket lab (SPACs aren\u2019t allowed so when I first posted it months ago, it was taken down). In addition, there has been interesting news regarding the space launch industry as a whole, specifically with respect to satellite constellation launches for providing greater accessibility to affordable high bandwidth internet, all over the world (yay), and real-time global surveillance via satellites with 50cm camera precision (kinda &amp; oh no).\n\nNews\n1. Amazon Project Kuiper \ud83d\udd25 - Amazon had announced its own internet satellite constellation project to launch 3k satellites by 2026-2029. Initial 6 or 9 flights assigned to ULA. RKLB\u2019s constellation supporting rocket, Neutron, is set to be ready to launch in 2024, ready in time to *maybe* capture some business from Amazon IN ADDITION to all of the ISPs that are going to be banging launch providers doors down, to not get left out of the next great revolution in global internet coverage. \n2. RKLB\u2019s space systems business \ud83d\udc40 - RKLB just announced it had signed a deal to supply reaction wheels \u201cfor a number of undisclosed satellite constellations.\u201d AFAIK satellites need 3 reaction wheels to control their orientation on all 3 axes (keeping a 4th as backup). Their production facility at initial capacity will output 2000 a year. 2000 / 4 == 500 satellites a year they are expecting to provision. For reference they\u2019ve only launched 100 satellites themselves so far.\n3. Astra (ASTR) \ud83d\ude2a - had 2 failed launches last weekend in a row, still haven\u2019t made it to orbit, still valued at about 1/2 that of rocket lab (what is wrong with this market). Launch reliability should have a premium, rocket lab has a proven track record of launch reliability.\n4. Firefly (private) \ud83d\ude2a - watching their livestream of launch right now, and it\u2019s not going too well (called an abort). But we\u2019ll see how it goes\u2026\n\nSome Key Upcoming Events\n1. September 8, Earnings \ud83c\udf7f - likely will hear status updates regarding larger neutron rocket, as well as their space systems business (please tell us about the contracts regarding reaction wheels mentioned above).\n2. Lunar Mission 2021 (probably Q4) \ud83c\udf1d - do I even have to say anything? What other space startup is set to fly to the moon this year, for NASA? What doors will this open for them \ud83d\udeaa?\n3. September-October, Back to back to back launches for global surveillance company Black Sky \ud83d\udc40 - this is very interesting as rocket lab has never turned around rockets this fast before. Demonstrating extremely rapid launch cadence will be proving to customer that they can schedule launch on demand essentially. In months, eventually weeks but not years. I expect to also see rocket lab demonstrate reusability of their electron rockets, by catching some with a helicopter (not joking) \ud83d\ude81.\n\nSummary:\n1. Rocket lab is in a much better position than other space startups that are either still in theoretical phase (never launched), and those that are trying to launch but just can\u2019t seem to get their rockets flying straight (Astra).\n2. Entrance of tech giants and ISP heavy weights into satellite constellation business is evidence that we are on the brink of a satellite launching party (from all ISPs to avoid getting amazoned, and want to keep their consistently high cash flow business models: Verizon, AT&amp;T, etc.). From all the launches, the planet might heat up a few degrees \ud83d\ude13.\n3. Their neutron rocket is being developed at the right time to compete with SpaceX for launch contracts for such constellations (I also really doubt any one launch provider has the bandwidth to take all the contracts).\n4. Their space systems business (reaction wheels for one), will be a nice revenue stream, even for the satellites that they don\u2019t launch themselves, yet still develop and produce key parts of.\n\nPositions/Disclosure: I have a lot of shares",

        "selftext": "Alright Apes, this is following on from my DD a few days ago, RKLB price has grown about 40% since then. Results have just been announced and there's some real nice stuff in there, I've tried to condense it a bit below and highlight the best bits.\n\nRevenue is not that high and this is to be expected, they're a growing company furiously investing in their future. Still profitable though which can't be said of SPCE, ASTR and Blue Origin. Backlog has shot up (137%), lots of work to keep them busy and keep the money coming in.\n\nThe most important thing is the amount of diversification. Their Space Systems business has grown significantly. They are quickly becoming a full service launch provider. You could argue they're more diverse than Space X in some regards. This is why I think they're such a safe long term bet. In the short term though, as more people are learning about them, the price is shooting up so there is money to be made. I'm personally targeting $30 a share short term and even that is conservative as that still values them well under SPCE at its' peak, and SPCE is nowhere near as valuable a stock as RKLB\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Revenue of $29.5M, representing 237% Year-on-Year revenue growth, accompanied by an expansion in gross margins from negative 67% to a* ***positive 13%****.*\n\n***Increasing diversity in revenue****, with Space Systems contributing 18% of total revenue in the period, compared to 3% in the prior year, accompanied with gross margins of 65%.*\n\n***Backlog grew 136% Year-on-Year to $141.4 million as of June 30, 2021 as compared to backlog of $59.9 million as of June 30, 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Entered into a contract with Varda Space Industries to manufacture and operate three Photon spacecraft to enable **in-space manufacturing**.\n* Entered into a contract with BlackSky Global for five Electron launches to support their **constellation growth**.\n* Entered into a study contract for a **Mars mission** that will see Rocket Lab develop two Photon spacecraft in support of the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory for a NASA science mission.\n* Successfully **recovered an Electron booster** for the second time, further advancing the program to make Electron a reusable launch vehicle to increase launch cadence and reduce cost per mission.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince June 30, 2021 Rocket Lab also:\n\n* Entered into a contract with Kin\u00e9is for five Electron launches to deploy their entire constellation of 25 satellites.\n* Signed launch services agreements to deploy satellites for Alba Orbital and Aurora Propulsion Technologies.\n* Began construction on a new **high volume production line capable of producing up to 2,000 reaction wheels per year** to support a growing number of contracts with constellation customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\npositions: 500 shares/average $10.50",
