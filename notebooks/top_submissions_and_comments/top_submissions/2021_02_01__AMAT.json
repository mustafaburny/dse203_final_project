        "selftext": "This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or \"counterfeit\" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = '&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split('|');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':\n                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res['volume']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print('{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Friday. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-19-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures bounce after biggest one-day February loss\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their biggest one-day losses in the red-hot month of February. The Dow, which broke a three-day winning streak and fell from a record closing high, remained on track for a positive week, which would be its third straight. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are riding three-day losing streaks and are on pace for their first losing weeks in the past three.\n\n&gt; * B/itcoin \u2014 which topped $52,000 this week \u2014 hit another all-time high early Friday near $53,000 per unit. After Tesla and other companies recently showed support for the world\u2019s biggest c/ryptocurrency, major financial firms also appeared to be warming to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Thursday she believes b/itcoin is a \u201chighly speculative asset.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Treasury Secretary Yellen pushes for major Covid stimulus\n\n&gt; * As the House aims to pass its version of President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief blueprint by the end of next week, Yellen told CNBC that a large stimulus package is necessary to get the economy back to full strength. \u201cThe price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big,\u201d she said.\u201d We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run.\u201d Democrats hope to get their bill through Congress before March 14, when key federal jobless benefit programs expire.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Biden to pledge billions in global Covid vaccination aid\n\n&gt; * Biden is expected to announce Friday that the U.S. will spend $4 billion on international Covid vaccination efforts. He will make the pledge during his first virtual meeting as president with G-7 leaders. Biden will also urge other nations to put more money toward the global fight against the pandemic.\n\n&gt; * Later in the day, Biden travels to Michigan to visit Pfizer\u2019s vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, a trip that was supposed to happen Thursday but was postponed due winter weather. Biden made his first domestic trip as president Tuesday, traveling to Wisconsin for a CNN town hall on the coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Uber dealt a major blow as UK\u2019s top court rules drivers are workers\n\n&gt; * Shares of Uber dropped another 3% in the premarket after the Supreme Court in the U.K. ruled Friday that the company\u2019s drivers there should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. The ruling out of Britain ends an almost five-year legal battle between Uber and a group of former drivers there. Uber insists its drivers are self-employed and that it acts as more of an \u201cagency\u201d that connects them with passengers through an app. The company weathered a challenge in its home market of California in November, when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hailing drivers\u2019 status as independent contractors, not employees.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defends controversial Wall Street practice\n\n&gt; * During Thursday\u2019s GameStop hearing, Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defended a controversial method brokerages use to make money, and said his firm would adapt if new regulations prohibited the practice. Members of Congress spent much of their time prodding about \u201cpayment for order flow,\u201d a practice in which a brokerage receives payment from a market maker like Citadel, known as a dealer, for directing the order to them. This model is how Robinhood and other brokers are able to offer commission-free trading. \u201cI do believe that payment for order flow has been an important source of innovation in the industry,\u201d Griffin added.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nxHmaP5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GIRwl9k.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/VbE1lLY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/gGk8pg5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8AYKTCG.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yYi6DTL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BRv9eiQ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1SY4cN7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/nYlYObU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jBrK42f/divical1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-deere-dropbox-novavax-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Deere (DE)** \u2013 The heavy equipment maker earned $3.87 per share for its fiscal first quarter, compared to a consensus estimate of $2.14 a share.

One is with a leading innovator that is also one of the largest municipal water districts in the United States. The need for PFAS removal is becoming a high priority for many water districts globally and the current need for remediation is estimated at about $60B\n* BioLargo\u2019s first successful product launched in 2016, CupriDyne Clean, for VOC\u2019s and unrivaled odor control, is being adopted by some of the biggest municipal and publicly owned companies in the world\n* FDA registered Clyraguard, has been proven at a leading government National Infectious Disease Lab to completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2. It features unprecedented safety for disinfecting PPE while remaining safe on skin.\n* Clyraguard is [available](https://www.amazon.com/Clyraguard-Personal-Protection-Spray-mineral-based/dp/B08JNFJ38F/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=JZWQMUZGCA0K&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=clyraguard%2Bhospital-grade%2C%2Bfda-registered%2C%2Bppe%2Bdisinfectant%2Bspray&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1608239102&amp;source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWVlSOTdBS1k5QzVTJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNDg4OTE4MUY1REJTVERNVldVNyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODkyNTg4MTZQTTNYSDQ0Qk5TJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&amp;sprefix=clyragu%2Caps%2C286&amp;sr=8-1-spons) on Amazon and other distribution channels and early sales are just beginning (NOTE FROM MODERATOR - PUT ON HOLD WHILE WORKING ON LABEL EXPANSION)\n* BioLargo also developed disruptive solutions for the giant water treatment industry, stormwater, and food processing industries and the company reports it is getting ready to deliver its first AOS Water Treatment System valued at $500,000 and has a major commercial pilot underway with a leading municipality in Montreal\n* BioLargo\u2019s growth and sales trajectory are pointing to positive net cash flow in well under one year\n* Positive net cash flow would immediately reduce or eliminate the need for raising additional operating capital from convertible lenders that has a history of depressing the share price. We believe the supply of shares that have been sold into the market from convertible note sellers has created a remarkable buying opportunity today\n* With Pros heavily outweighing the Cons, BioResearchAlert finds BioLargo shares highly attractive and undervalued. Perhaps most importantly we find that investment timing couldn\u2019t be better than now because the company\u2019s sales are growing at a pace that is very close to achieving positive net cash flow that will work to reduce the supply of shares and increase buying. All factors are converging and pointing to substantially higher prices in the near term and for the long haul\n\nSavvy investors know from experience that one of the biggest investment challenges is timing. Almost every publicly traded company has a story so good that it entices many investors, but the two most obvious questions that always seem to pop up are; First, will they succeed? And second, WHEN? Experienced investors know only too well the importance of timing. After all, the amount of time spent in any investment is directly related to the real Return On Investment or \u201cROI\u201d. And ROI is always measured in units of time - typically one year.\n\nA deep dive into BioLargo, Inc. (BLGO: OTCQB) demonstrates a company that has spent several long and challenging years, and approximately $25 million building the company while developing technologies that are finally now ready for prime-time commercialization.\n\nFast forward to today. Their first successful commercial product is called CupriDyne Clean that in 2016 was introduced to the Waste Handling and Cannabis industries. Competing odor control products work by masking problematic odors with an overpowering scent of lemon or cherry or some other acceptable smell. Odor masking does not eliminate the source of the problem, but CupriDyne Clean actually breaks down the odor causing compounds for complete elimination. When witnessed in person it\u2019s simply amazing.\n\nThis recent short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link&amp;v=ReI9CB0eluE) presentation at the most recent LD Micro Investor Conference is a definite must for serious investors. It highlights BioLargo\u2019s impressive progress and how close they are to busting out on their way to becoming a unicorn with their first $1 billion market capitalization.\n\nThe following illustrations, charts, and product descriptions were presented at this conference:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26wk9mqo7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b90e432766d37997da8635874e00423bdf89f94\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g91peiur7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a2a1a541720370772c9dbad8b922d2ae1bb333f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d4zvz0w7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eff6d1eb3ba645385a309a16deaa2673557ebe72\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b68g5bxx7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b45a5f96f9a91c25e6263efca30f2b163314cec\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41wynjpz7qj61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46feb8259eae0b7417f5b91771a3914c8506dbb4\n\n**Investment Pros**\n\nManagement has proven they are committed and has navigated an incredible journey to develop unrivaled proprietary products for very large markets. Their financials are improving and their timing to market ranges from now to the very short-term horizon.\n\n**Investment Cons**\n\nThe company will have to pick partners very carefully, uplist to the larger NASDAQ market, and once they generate positive cash flow, they will require additional capital to accelerate their growth trajectory.\n\nESG or Green Tech Investments\n\nBioLarge is an outstanding ESG company and #ESG or #GreenTech Investments are becoming an integral part of a preponderance of institutional and individual investors. Following is a partial list of ESG tickers: \u00a0EW, EQIX, POD, EME, CDNS, NRC, NED, MSFT, HAS, OC, HD, MLHR, ORA, TXN, BFAM, CRM, AMAT, KEYS, WST, DECK, IDXX, CPB, CBRE, PWR, ES, PG, RMD, A, AXTA, GOOG, MKC, VRTX, TNDM, KSU, SRE, GIS, AMGN, TNET, GWW, TROW, ADBE, BWXT, MMC, PEAK, ACM, PEP, INTU, CMI, WAT, MEI, AMPE, GAXY, INO, SRNE, MRNA, HTBX, IBIO, VXRT, VBIV, ONTX, TNXP, CODX, NVAX, VIR, APT\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe believe BioLargo\u2019s share price of $.14 per share and market cap of $30 million represents an exceptionally well-timed investment opportunity. With the company decisively shifting gears from R&amp;D to launching disruptive products to fill large market needs and convertible debt financing coming to a close, we foresee rising share prices beginning very shortly and continuing for years to come. BioLargo is a very impressive company that after a long and challenging development cycle is now poised to see shares trading at strikingly higher prices beginning in the near future.\n\nDennis Calvert, BioLargo\u2019s CEO says, *\u201cIf you want the prize, you have to do the hard work. BioLargo is a company that has done the hard work and is about to get the prize.\u201d*",

So obviously it has grown significantly, but not more than the market as a whole, with a beta(5y) of 0.99 showing it has actually followed the market incredibly closely.-  In terms of volatility it is rather stable with an avg volume of 1.2 million (2.47%) meaning it's not a great play for day traders generally but promising for long-term investors that are risk-averse.-  Additionally it's not a shortsqueeze play as only 4.77% of the shares are shorted (2.4mil).-  Their P/E ratio ttm is at 98,6 which is rather high, but more a result of the current market than the individual company as their competitors has an average P/E ratio ttm of 106 which is also dragged down significantly by  **Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)**  which has a ha P/E ratio ttm of 17.6. Moreover, SEDG's forward P/E ratio is at 72.4-  Their PEG ratio (5y) however is only at 3.71 with their competitors much higher at 5.396 which goes to show that their expected growth is much higher than their competitors. And personally i prefer PEG when considering growth companies, so i put more faith in this number than P/E ratio.\n\nIn general I feel the ticker is not comparatively overvalued when you look at the clean energy sector as well as their direct rivals such as Enphase. and it doesn't have the same risky factors that often come with many ticker DD's such as BB, AMC or GME.\n\n# 'The Company\n\nAs for the company itself, they have a revenue stream of 1.52B with a  GAAP gross margin of 32% which is both a really strong margin as well as much more stable than their main competitor Enphase which has only very recently turned profitable. They also only have 615M in debt while have over 1.1B in total cash. Those two factors combined, leave a lot of room to keep growing in the future, while indicating that they already know how to stay profitable.\n\nAdditionally the company has the majority market share in the US as well as a very large market share in europe. They are much more geographically diversified compared to other competitors such as Enphase or SolarCity which are primarily operate in the US.   \nMoreover, the growth expectation for the global solar energy market is 20.5% CAGR from 52.5 Billion to 222.3 Billion from 2018 to 2026. \n\nThey are headquartered in Israel which is the main hub for technology outside of silicon valley, and their management is comprised of Zvi Lando (CEO), Ronen Faier (CFO), Uri Bechor (COO), Meir Adest (CPO &amp; CIO), Amir Fishelov (CSA), Ilan Yoscovich (CTO) and Yogev Barak (CMO). In general the management team is a competent team. While none of them are eccentric figures such as Ryan Cohen , Elon Musk or Steve Jobs, they all have a lengthy resume within their respective fields and have stayed consistent with their plan and are very systematic and aggressive with their expansion strategy. As a highlight, the CEO, Zvi Lando has been CEO since September 2019 and before that he was the excetutive VP of sales for SolarEdge Technologies. His education is as an engineer from a prominent techonological university in Israel and before he joined SEDG he was an engineer, process diagnostic manager, and general manager at Applied Materials Inc, where he worked for 15 years. Applied Materials Inc is also a technological company that focusses on chip production, Semiconductors, flat panel displays for computers, smartphones and tv's as well as photovoltaic systems (Solar panels).\n\nAs for partnerships they are partnered with Flextronics International Ltd. which is the third largest global electronics manufactorer, located in Singapore which allows them to operate at a cheaper price, while providing excellent products due to their highly educated populace and great infrastructure.They are also partnered with Tesla(SolarCity) in development of Photovoltaic systems and energy storage (batteries) which is a huge boost as Tesla has a ton of techonological advantages when it comes to Lithium batteries.They also accuired a majority stake in Kokam, a South korean Battery producer with the expressed purpose of increasing their production capabilities for batteries as well as furthering their battery techonlogy.Lastly, they also partnered up with  Schneider Electric to capture markets further in Europe and and NA.\n\nThe company is also backed by prominent institutional investors and venture capital such as GE, JP morgan, Norwest, Lightspeed, Genesis Opus Capital.\n\n# The Product(s)\n\nSEDG has 5 main products, all of them interconnected to a certain degree.\n\nThe products are their Power Optimizers, Inverters, Monitoring Portal, Installer Tools and Batteries (energy storage)\n\nStarting from the ground up, we can start with the Power Optimizers.Normal PV systems (Solar panels) function by adjusting a solar installation as a group (multiple panels) to ensure that none of them \"overproduce\" energy that the collective system cannot contain and or produce, essentially meaning that the panels adjust to the lowest common denominator. SEDG power optimizers are embedded into each individual panel, and combined with the inverters, allow for  Maximum Power Point Tracking for each panel, meaning that they all produce the maximum amount they are able to. Normal PV systems are hindered by multiple factors such as partial shade, uneven soiling, or conversely if they exceed standard inverters permissible  voltage range. Additionally, the Power Optimizers also transmit concurrent measurements and data of each panel. (this will be important later)\n\nThis leads nicely into the inverters, which in conjunction with the power optimizers also functions by the same principle of maximizing each panels performance allowing conversion from DC to AC at various levels for each panel. This allows for a maximum performance of 97% efficiency compared to 68.7%-86.8% efficiency.\n\nThe Installer Tools is a software tool that helps with the installation, that automatically recommends string layout, inverter and power optimizer selection in accordance with the given projects size, location, and specific circumstances. Moreover, it also provides a configuration tool that allows for remote and on site verification of correct installation in real-time and provides a virtual map of the PV system on site.\n\nAfter installation they also offer a Monitoring Portal that allows for easy tracking through either smartphone or computer. The product alerts the user when issues occur ranging from site-wide issues all the way down to each module. The portal, like the installer tool, creates a virtual map of the site allowing for easy problem identification remotely, making it much easier to deal with commercially as they'll know exactly what, who and how much/many to dispatch to solve the issue. Additionally, the service is entirely free for the user and cost little to nothing for SEDG. This has proven hugely beneficial compared to Enphase which had a subscription service that performed poorly, they then made it free, but almost immediately had to change it to an upfront cost, to stay profitable. This has not been an issue for SEDG as mentioned earlier.\n\nLastly, their battery technology is almost at a point where they can use it commercially to store energy when peak supply is reached doing the day, and then sell it doing bottom supply, meaning they avoid the fluctuations of solar energy that plagues the industry. Now, obviously they already have the technology for this, that is not revolutionary. However, what is consequential is that they've almost hit a point where it is profitable. The cost of providing the grid with energy at bottom supply from peaker plants is much more expensive than normal power plant production, and the cost of battery storage for SolarEdge is at the turningpoint of being more cheap than those peaker plants, which will revolutionize clean energy as a whole, and being one of the first companies to achieve it will result in absurd growth.\n\n# The Market &amp; Politics\n\nFinally, the major concern I personally have about SEDG is a general concern for an upcomming bear market/recession. However, as their products are primarily utility providers they are not as exposed to a recession and will not see their revenue drop. Moreover, in the event of a recession I believe that Clean Energy will be one of the sectors that Biden and Europe will attempt to pump money into similarly to the massive road and infrastructure spending that generally occurs doing recessions.And outside of a bear market/recession we know that Biden is huge on clean energy and aims to transform the US into a zero-emission country sooner rather than later. Similarly many European countries are adopting or have already adopted the same goals.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion/TLDR\n\nThe ticker is not overvalued compared to the sector or the market, and generally looks better than it's direct competitors. The company has strong fundamentals, a competent management team,  with a lead  in market share and technology compared to rivals. They have strong partnerships with leading copmanies in their respective fields and has a large geographical diversification.  Their products are cutting edge, and user friendly, and the company would be somewhat shielded from a recession/bear market and is in a sector that is expected to grow massively, both organically as well as with support from governements aiming to go green. I personally expect a growth of around 25-40% CAGR in the stock price on a 6-8 year time frame.\n\n\\*Position I have 300$ (2%) of my portfolio currently in SEDG, and will buy 2500$ (will then be 18.6%) on tuesday.  \n\\* Tuesday at 4:30 PM EST SEDG releases their 4qtr earnings report, and it's largely expected to great with 7% increase in revenue compared to last qtr.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/stimulus-prospects-could-boost-the-stock-market-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.\n*****\n&gt; Walmart\u2019s earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government\u2019s retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank\u2019s view on inflation.\n*****\n&gt; # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects\n&gt; Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It\u2019s going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.\n*****\n&gt; Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is less pushback to President Biden\u2019s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,\u201d noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.\n*****\n&gt; They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.\n*****\n&gt; Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.\n*****\n&gt; It has also increased concerns about inflation.\n*****\n&gt; # Inflation and rising yields\nIn the past week, the 10-year yield \u2014 a key benchmark \u2014 touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you think about the big drivers, they\u2019re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. \u201cIf there\u2019s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBecause there\u2019s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we\u2019ll see if that has eased,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cObviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.\n*****\n&gt; # Housing statistics\nHousing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.\n*****\n&gt; The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes\nStocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.\n*****\n&gt; There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.\n*****\n&gt; Robinhood\u2019s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.\n*****\n&gt; The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market\u2019s advance is intact.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, it\u2019s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,\u201d Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there\u2019s cyclical leadership.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,\u201d said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.\n*****\n&gt; The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/L9zmpOB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cZgpsNC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/BvmjknF.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/wWv2RIG.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AfQYO3V.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GNiq0fE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/v4lTpw4.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/83YL2qB.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0AZF7RF.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/MUQx3xY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/60KQa22.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LBj1NDa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidents' Day Seasonality\n\n&gt; The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&amp;P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&amp;P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&amp;P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&amp;P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&amp;P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&amp;P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Trading After Presidents\u2019 Day Weekend Continues to be Weak\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents\u2019 Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents\u2019 Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of \u20130.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of \u20130.49% and a median loss of \u20130.11%.\n\n&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents\u2019 Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of \u20130.07% and a median decline of \u20130.10%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 31, average \u20130.02%, median \u20130.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average \u20130.01%, median \u20130.09%.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox\n\n&gt; \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n&gt; The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs\u2014it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!\n\n&gt; Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&amp;P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn\u2019t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThe year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here\u2019s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Short Interest Update\n\n&gt; Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.\n\n&gt; On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, which now has over 30% of shares short, has risen 91.01%. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**\n\n&gt; Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three\u2014nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)\u2014now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**\n\n&gt; Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**\n\n&gt; Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Agg-Industry.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX2qSnPh7aQ))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PLTR** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$FSLY** \n&gt; * **$FVRR** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$TWLO** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$TTD** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$DBX** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$YNDX** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$LPX** \n&gt; * **$ZTS** \n&gt; * **$TRU** \n&gt; * **$SPWR** \n&gt; * **$ECL** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$BIGC** \n&gt; * **$SEDG** \n&gt; * **$EXPD** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$MRO** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$STMP** \n&gt; * **$USFD** \n&gt; * **$TRMN** \n&gt; * **$ET** \n&gt; * **$BKI** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$TRTN** \n&gt; * **$VMC** \n&gt; * **$TSEM** \n&gt; * **$SNBR** \n&gt; * **$HLT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QgDa3h7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE TUESDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/JRy8Aaj.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

        "selftext": "Hi! I've been getting into investing a lot recently, and I'm doing this mainly for my own experience. I'll take any feedback or comments y'all have. Let me know what you think of my first list!\n\nTo start off, I want to disclose how I picked this list. I used Morgan Stanley's stock screener to find tickers with their \"overweight\" rating and a price below their given price target (if applicable). Next, I would cross-reference that with RH and Zack's stock analysis. Finally, I would search for each ticker on Reddit in order to see what the sentiment towards the stock was. After compiling the list, I went through each stock individually again and assigned it a ranking of 1-5 (1 being safe, 5 being more speculative/risky), as well as providing a hypothetical dollar amount that I would invest in at the current price.\n\nThe goal of this list was to pick a balanced portfolio between aggressive growth and long term consistency. I have a huge bias towards semiconductors, biomedical, tech, and industrial/material.\n\nI'll start with the stocks I gave a 1 rating\n\n1. MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB, AAPL ($8k in each)\n\nI believe these will be here for a loooong time as well as continue to grow. These seem pretty safe to me and make up the foundation of this portfolio\n\nNow we get to stocks with a 2 rating. These are my favorites, as I see them having high growth potential and staying power (still riskier than 1s, however)\n\n2. NVDA, AMD, TXG, AMAT, MT, VALE, RTX, TDG, QRVO, NIO, TSLA ($5k in each)\n\n Now we get on to the 3s! These will follow a similar pattern of higher risk, less amount invested.\n\n3. TER, LRCX, ON, MCHP, FSLY, CRSR, RDSB, DOCU ($3k in each)\n\nNow we get to the 4s. These are mostly speculative\n\n4. SPCE, ANTM, NET, ACAD, ABCL ($2k in each)\n\nThat list was pretty short. The 5s will be the most risky/most speculative. They will have the lowest amount invested in them.\n\n5. TGH, SEDG, HUM, AMKR.\n\nOh and positions: 20 VOO, 62 QQQ, 28 LIT, and 54 PLTR. If you made it to the end of this post, thank you!",

        "selftext": "I am trying to identify overlooked stocks in semiconductor sector.\n\n=========\n\nUMC: United Microelectronics Corp\n\nUMC is a semiconductor foundry based in Hsinchu, Taiwan. It started as a spinoff of Taiwan\u2019s national semiconductor research arm and was the first Taiwanese semiconductor to be listed in NYSE. During its early days of foundation, many key figures who later built the TSM success, including Morris Chang, worked at UMC. Late January UMC announced its 2020 Q4 result. Its net profit exceeds NT$10 billion (US$357.1 million) in that quarter, with profits for 2020 reaching a 14-year high of NT$29.19 billion. On Feb.8 UMC also announced its January 2021 net sales grew more than 10% YoY.\n\nPersonal pros:\n\n\\-UMC is like a miniature TSM, with a lot of support from the Taiwanese gov and a strong footing in global semiconductor foundry business. With most of the money chasing TSM, UMC has the potential to catch up as a lagger.\n\n\\-The world is experiencing a severe shortage of automobile chips and even TSM is burdened with a heavy load of rush orders. UMC\u2019s products are heavily demanded by automobile industry. Recently UMC\u2019s executives met with Taiwan gov to discuss speeding up car chips production.\n\n\\-Price of UMC stocks now fluctuates between $10-$11. It is already a 400% hike from a year ago but is still cheap enough to buy a large lot.\n\nMy personal cons:\n\n\\-The majority of UMC\u2019s production facilities (9) are in Taiwan, with three others in Singapore, mainland China and Japan respectively. Strained politics could cause issue for UMC\u2019s product delivery.\n\n\\- UMC acquired Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor in 2019 to enhance its indigenous capabilities, but they are still much weaker than TSM and other big names. It is, to its core, a foundry focused on production rather than development. UMC\u2019s most advanced node of production stands at 14nm, while TSM and others have mature 7nm node lines and are advancing to 5nm and 3nm nodes.\n\n==========\n\nAMAT?\n\nI am trying to identify companies similar to UMC but haven\u2019t had much success. The majority of UMC's counterparts are listed in Taiwan, China and HK. I am not quite familiar with the European side, so I looked back at the US and had some thoughts about AMAT.\n\nAMAT is like an infrastructure stock for semiconductor industry. It is the largest global producer of equipment essential to every semiconductor manufacturer and designer, competing against the likes of ASML and Lam Research. Buying AMAT sounds like a sure-win strategy: every winner and loser in the semiconductor business needs its products.\n\nBut AMAT is hardly \u201coverlooked\u201d. There are a lot of talks about the company and big money is already chasing the stock after its announcement of better-than-expected results this week. I am thinking about buying some AMAT as a short-term gamble.\n\nYour thoughts are welcome!",

        "selftext": "I am currently looking at investment plays to take advantage of the semiconductor shortage occurring right now in the US.\nWhat I know:\nThe real issue here is the lack of US located foundries as most semiconductor companies outsource this process to China and other cheaper countries overseas.\nWhat I'm Trying to Figure Out:\nI know Applied Materials designs and sells semiconductors, but I'm not sure of their foundry situation.\nMy Current Thoughts:\nI feel like due to the supply and demand of the current semiconductor situation means that prices for semiconductors should be going up due to this supply shrinkage. As AMAT (known as a one-stop-shop for a vast variety of semiconductor product types) sells such a diversified product line, I feel like they have protection from the choke in supply but will benefit from the rising chip prices.\nSince I'm obviously not incredibly knowledgable in this industry, I am taking the above assumptions as true to fuel my trading thesis below:\nI believe that AMAT (trading at $117.90 as of writing this) will have a great week this week, and then an even more successful 3 months.\n1 Week Outlook: As AMAT plans to post Q4 earnings on Feb 18th, the company will post healthy earnings as the world continues to work from home, school from home, and the semiconductor shortage grows further boosting prices of chips. The outlook could include speculation about receiving government funding for the aid and research into improving supply chain chokepoints in semiconductor production. I believe the week of 2/16 - 2/19 will see an increase of about 10-15% due to continuing upward momentum of semiconductor stocks and impressive earnings.\nMy suggested play is to buy 2/19 $120c at open on Tuesday. If the stock opens at what it's currently trading at after hours, these calls would price at about $2.10 each. If the stock price were to increase by 10%, (ending 2/19 at $129.69), these calls would be worth $9.69 each - a 361.4% increase in a week.\n3 Month Outlook: Due to a continuing effort to improve chip production volumes and improve relationships with overseas foundries, AMAT as an industry leader will continue its supremacy over other semiconductor companies and have more sway over government funding programs. Increased funding, high semiconductor prices and massive and constantly growing demand volume will combine to continue to pull AMAT upward. If AMAT were to receive some of the government funding expected to be included in the executive orders assumed to be signed by Biden in the coming 3 (or so) weeks, AMAT will get an artificial bump, along with increased exposure and a subsequent boost to the stock price.\nMy suggested play is to buy shares on margin to increase leverage on a longterm hold with no time expiration.\n\nWhat I think I'm wrong about:\nI know the shortage is mainly appearing in the auto industry. AMAT produces semiconductors for the auto industry, but they also provide so many other types of products that diversify their exposure. This may also mean that any positive effects from rising chip prices may be diluted by being such a small part of the revenue makeup of the company. I think I may also be wrong about assuming AMAT can even benefit from a semiconductor shortage as they may get caught in the strangling of foundry contracting. I also know the government funding is mainly going to be for funding US located foundries which may not even affect AMAT as I do not believe they operate any foundries at all.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts and help me better understand the situation. I almost made a couple trades today on this thesis but figured I should get a better understanding before risking money in a strategy that wasn't fully vetted or understood. Thank you all!",

        "selftext": " \n\nAll options are weekly options expiring Feb19, 2021\n\n**IMPORTANT**: My options trading strategy is based on pricing and the odds I think are for an event to occur. For example, Let\u2019s say APPL is trading at 140 into earnings, and the 147/148 call spread trades at $0.30 giving a payoff of 233% or 2.33 to one. Now, if I think (not what the options market thinks) the likelihood AAPL will be above 148 is 20%, then I will sell the spread. If I think it is 50% then I will buy the spread, so that\u2019s basically my methodology. The pricing must be favorable to what I think the odds should be versus what the market prices them at.\n\nTuesday trades:\n\n**RNG** (1-2 contract limit depending on strike price)  \nHigh RSI, BB Expanded, leaning towards a five-point wing butterfly for 0.05-0.09 debit. It is thinly traded, so it will have to be a miracle fill, and I will be frugal on my limit order. I won\u2019t pay up.  \n\n\n**SHOP** (1-2 contract limit depending on strike price)  \nHigh RSI, BB Expanded, but stock is 45 points below the 1499.75 high it made on Wed. Leaning towards picking a direction depending on the pricing. May sell a credit to pay for a debit. Example sell 1400/1380 Put spread, buy 1500/1520 call spread for a net credit of 0.35  \n \n\n**ADI** (1-2 contract limit depending on strike price)  \nLeaning for a breakout here. I expect pricing to be tight, and may not give me the payoff I am looking for. The spreads are priced exactly where I think the odds are, so no edge. A coin flip.\n\nWednesday trades:  \nwill be updated on Tuesday\n\n**FSLY** (3-5 contract limit depending on strike price)  \n**TLRY** (seeing conflicting earnings dates on this one will have to confirm. Liquidity isn\u2019t an issue)  \n**TWLO** (1-2 contract limit depending on strike price)  \n**BIDU** (5-15 contract limit depending on strike price)  \n**SPWR** (1-3 contract limit depending on strike price)  \n**WMT** (10-50 contract limit depending on strike price)  \n\n\nThursday trades  \n**ROKU** (2-5 contract limit depending on strike price)  \n**AMAT** (5-15 contract limit depending on strike price)  \n**DROP** (5-15 contract limit depending on strike price)\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am not a financial adviser. The above is for entertainment/educational purpose only. I may or may not enter these trades or other trades in the above listed securities which may be in a bullish or bearish direction depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to pricing, liquidity, market direction, and the pricing of the underlying asset.\n\n**Additional Disclaimer**: The above strategies are not suitable for most trades due to various reasons including but not limited to the financial ability to take delivery or deliver the underlying stock at expiration. These risks were not considered when looking at these trade setups since I have a portfolio margin account, which enables me for example to make adjustments by buying or selling short the underlying at the close or afterhours. For example, XYZ closes at 151, and I am long a 145/155 call spread, I can short the stock before the close or afterhours and cover it with the auto exercise at 145.\u00a0",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, February 19, 2021**\n\nAfter opening the day higher, stocks pulled back throughout the session to finish in the red, closing out a very volatile week in the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.17% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed 0.44% down, and the Dow (DIA) closed 0.03% down. Even though the major indexes pulled back this week, they continue to hover near record levels as optimism over additional stimulus continues to fuel higher levels of risk tolerance among market participants. \n\nThere are many encouraging developments surrounding the coronavirus. This week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago, according to data analyzed by the New York Times. Furthermore, [analysis from Bloomberg on Thursday ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/how-many-vaccine-doses-are-available-u-s-should-see-a-surge?srnd=premium)showed that the U.S. vaccine supply is poised to double from the current rate of 10 million to 15 million doses per week within the next few weeks, allowing more shots to be given in the near-term.\n\nThursday night, in an interview with CNBC, Treasury Secretary Yellen said a large stimulus package is still necessary to build up sufficient momentum for economic recovery to take off on its own. She said, \u201cWe think it\u2019s very important to have a big package \\[that\\] addresses the pain this has caused \u2013 15 million Americans behind on their rent, 24 million adults and 12 million children who don\u2019t have enough to eat, small businesses failing. I think the price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big. We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run,\u201d she added.\u201d \n\nDespite a record low supply and a temporary pullback in December, the housing market remains very strong. According to a report by the National Association of Realtors, sales ended the month of January at a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 6.69 million units. That figure is 0.6 higher than December and 23.7% higher when compared with January 2020 and the second-highest sales pace since April 2006.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed on Friday to press ahead with laws to force Facebook (FB) to pay news outlets for content, saying he had received support from world leaders after the social media giant blacked out all news media in the country. The US State Department said it sees the dispute as a business matter between a company and a country and is unlikely to get involved.\n* A SPAC called Forest Road Acquisition Corp recently announced a merger with Beachbody and Myx Fitness. The company\u2019s first SPAC raised $300 million and included one third of a warrant with units. Shaquille O\u2019Neal is a strategic advisor for this merger. \n* Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) impressive rally vaulted the cryptocurrency to a market cap larger than $1 trillion for the first time and well above $50,000 per coin\n* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by Argus from $155 to $180 at Buy. Stock currently around $158\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target is $140 at Overweight. Stock currently around $113\n* Arista Networks (ANET) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target around $350 at Outperform. Stock currently around $308\n* Baidu (BIDU) target raised by UBS Group from $315 to $400 at Buy. Stock currently around $298\n* Crocs (CROX) target raised by Pivotal Research from $87 to $92 at Buy. Stock currently around $80\n* Intuit (INTU) target raised by Barclays from \n* 4455 to $480 at Overweight. Stock currently around $415\n* Sunnova Energy (NOVA) target raised by B. Riley from $55 to $60 at Buy. Stock currently around $47\n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $425 to $515. Stock currently around $390\n* After positive earnings report, (ROKU) with a host of target raises. Conensus price target $575 at Buy. Stock currently around $450\n* The Trade Desk (TTD) with two target raises. Stock currently around $846\n   * Pivotal Research from $950 to $1010 Buy\n   * Oppenheimer from $900 to $950 at Outperform\n* WorkDay (WDAY) target raised by Evercore ISI from $290 to $320 at Outperform.

Dow futures bounce after biggest one-day February loss\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their biggest one-day losses in the red-hot month of February. The Dow, which broke a three-day winning streak and fell from a record closing high, remained on track for a positive week, which would be its third straight. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are riding three-day losing streaks and are on pace for their first losing weeks in the past three.\n\n&gt; * Bitcoin \u2014 which topped $52,000 this week \u2014 hit another all-time high early Friday near $53,000 per unit. After Tesla and other companies recently showed support for the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency, major financial firms also appeared to be warming to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Thursday she believes bitcoin is a \u201chighly speculative asset.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Treasury Secretary Yellen pushes for major Covid stimulus\n\n&gt; * As the House aims to pass its version of President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief blueprint by the end of next week, Yellen told CNBC that a large stimulus package is necessary to get the economy back to full strength. \u201cThe price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big,\u201d she said.\u201d We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run.\u201d Democrats hope to get their bill through Congress before March 14, when key federal jobless benefit programs expire.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Biden to pledge billions in global Covid vaccination aid\n\n&gt; * Biden is expected to announce Friday that the U.S. will spend $4 billion on international Covid vaccination efforts. He will make the pledge during his first virtual meeting as president with G-7 leaders. Biden will also urge other nations to put more money toward the global fight against the pandemic.\n\n&gt; * Later in the day, Biden travels to Michigan to visit Pfizer\u2019s vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, a trip that was supposed to happen Thursday but was postponed due winter weather. Biden made his first domestic trip as president Tuesday, traveling to Wisconsin for a CNN town hall on the coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Uber dealt a major blow as UK\u2019s top court rules drivers are workers\n\n&gt; * Shares of Uber dropped another 3% in the premarket after the Supreme Court in the U.K. ruled Friday that the company\u2019s drivers there should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. The ruling out of Britain ends an almost five-year legal battle between Uber and a group of former drivers there. Uber insists its drivers are self-employed and that it acts as more of an \u201cagency\u201d that connects them with passengers through an app. The company weathered a challenge in its home market of California in November, when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hailing drivers\u2019 status as independent contractors, not employees.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defends controversial Wall Street practice\n\n&gt; * During Thursday\u2019s GameStop hearing, Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defended a controversial method brokerages use to make money, and said his firm would adapt if new regulations prohibited the practice. Members of Congress spent much of their time prodding about \u201cpayment for order flow,\u201d a practice in which a brokerage receives payment from a market maker like Citadel, known as a dealer, for directing the order to them. This model is how Robinhood and other brokers are able to offer commission-free trading. \u201cI do believe that payment for order flow has been an important source of innovation in the industry,\u201d Griffin added.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nxHmaP5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GIRwl9k.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/VbE1lLY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/gGk8pg5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8AYKTCG.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yYi6DTL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BRv9eiQ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1SY4cN7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/nYlYObU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jBrK42f/divical1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* UAVS\n* FRX\n* BFARF\n* PLTR\n* ROKU\n* GSAH\n* UBER\n* EBON\n* BNB.X\n* TDAC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-deere-dropbox-novavax-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Deere (DE)** \u2013 The heavy equipment maker earned $3.87 per share for its fiscal first quarter, compared to a consensus estimate of $2.14 a share.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/stimulus-prospects-could-boost-the-stock-market-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.\n*****\n&gt; Walmart\u2019s earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government\u2019s retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank\u2019s view on inflation.\n*****\n&gt; # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects\n&gt; Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It\u2019s going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.\n*****\n&gt; Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is less pushback to President Biden\u2019s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,\u201d noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.\n*****\n&gt; They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.\n*****\n&gt; Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.\n*****\n&gt; It has also increased concerns about inflation.\n*****\n&gt; # Inflation and rising yields\nIn the past week, the 10-year yield \u2014 a key benchmark \u2014 touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you think about the big drivers, they\u2019re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. \u201cIf there\u2019s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBecause there\u2019s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we\u2019ll see if that has eased,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cObviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n&gt; Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.\n*****\n&gt; # Housing statistics\nHousing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.\n*****\n&gt; The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.\n*****\n&gt; On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes\nStocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.\n*****\n&gt; There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.\n*****\n&gt; Robinhood\u2019s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.\n*****\n&gt; The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market\u2019s advance is intact.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, it\u2019s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,\u201d Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there\u2019s cyclical leadership.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,\u201d said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.\n*****\n&gt; The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/L9zmpOB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cZgpsNC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/BvmjknF.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/wWv2RIG.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AfQYO3V.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GNiq0fE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/v4lTpw4.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/83YL2qB.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0AZF7RF.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/MUQx3xY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/60KQa22.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LBj1NDa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Presidents' Day Seasonality\n\n&gt; The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&amp;P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&amp;P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&amp;P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&amp;P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&amp;P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&amp;P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Trading After Presidents\u2019 Day Weekend Continues to be Weak\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents\u2019 Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents\u2019 Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of \u20130.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of \u20130.49% and a median loss of \u20130.11%.\n\n&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents\u2019 Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of \u20130.07% and a median decline of \u20130.10%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 31, average \u20130.02%, median \u20130.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average \u20130.01%, median \u20130.09%.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox\n\n&gt; \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n&gt; The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs\u2014it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!\n\n&gt; Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&amp;P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn\u2019t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThe year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here\u2019s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Short Interest Update\n\n&gt; Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.\n\n&gt; On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, which now has over 30% of shares short, has risen 91.01%. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**\n\n&gt; Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three\u2014nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)\u2014now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**\n\n&gt; Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**\n\n&gt; Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Agg-Industry.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX2qSnPh7aQ))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$PLTR** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$ROKU** \n&gt; * **$FSLY** \n&gt; * **$FVRR** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$TWLO** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$TTD** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$DBX** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$YNDX** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$LPX** \n&gt; * **$ZTS** \n&gt; * **$TRU** \n&gt; * **$SPWR** \n&gt; * **$ECL** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$BIGC** \n&gt; * **$SEDG** \n&gt; * **$EXPD** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$MRO** \n&gt; * **$RNG** \n&gt; * **$STMP** \n&gt; * **$USFD** \n&gt; * **$TRMN** \n&gt; * **$ET** \n&gt; * **$BKI** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$TRTN** \n&gt; * **$VMC** \n&gt; * **$TSEM** \n&gt; * **$SNBR** \n&gt; * **$HLT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QgDa3h7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE TUESDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/JRy8Aaj.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

        "selftext": "For anyone interested in learning about being an effective long term investor and doesn't want to be a victim of Mr. Market and your own emotions, I recommend reading the intelligent investor by Ben Graham. Graham is considered by many as the father of valuing investing and was Warren Buffett's professor at Columbia School Business and personal hero. Buffett, the GOAT of investing credits Graham as the reason for his success and continues to reread this classic book on investing psychology at the ripe old age of 90.\n\nGraham elegantly outlines the difference between the price of a stock and the intrinsic value of the company the stock represents. Many people continue to invest on pure speculation alone hoping to cash in on the next big trend or fad. They do this by completely ignoring cost and value and focusing instead on future products and services. For those unfamiliar with price and value discrepancies and the impact of ignoring these concepts, I recommend reading up on the dot com crash and great depression. Most intelligent people believe things such as EV and autonomous self driving cars are the future as is carbon free power grids and infrastructure. No business savvy person denies the potential of a company like Tesla and its disruptive impact on a number of companies and industries.\n\nHowever there is a major difference between speculation and potential and inherent value. The price of Tesla stock and the growth of its service lines, cash flow, and revenue streams seem very stretched considering it is worth more than Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, and Volkswagen combined but only sells a fraction of the vehicles of one of these competitors. In fact, the company commands a market cap greater than Berkshire Hathaway which the GOAT of investing (Buffett) spent decades to build and includes over 60 wholly owned companies including the largest rail road in the country (BNSF), a huge insurance business (Gieco), an energy enterprise (Berkshire Hathaway energy), a real estate empire, a consumer juggernaut (Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom), and a giant investment portfolio with house hold names like Coke, American Express, Apple, and Bank of America.\n\nInvesting in next gen companies at todays prices like Tesla today is foolhardy to say the least. Please do your homework if you plan to invest in things other than bread and butter market index funds. Even index funds are only as good as the indexes they track so please read up on the indexes your sector ETFs may be tracking to understand your risks. Also read up on your mutual funds and ask yourself if the expense ratios are worth the investment and if you are paying a team of investors to do more than track an index.\n\nIf you do choose to invest in individual stocks please invest in companies you believe have strong economic and competitive advantages or moats. Warren Buffett loves the term moat and statistics such as free cash flow, price to free cash flow, cash flow and revenue growth rates, price to book ratios, debt to equity ratios, and return on investment can help you decide if a company is worth the stock price. You will also need to spend alot of time reading about the companies you do choose to invest in as well as their competitors in order to maximize your returns and minimize your losses. Buying great companies today at fair prices will provide you superior returns as opposed to buying great companies at high prices its simple math. But to do this you will need to understand the psychology of investing and practice your investment convictions and patience. Anytime you buy a stock pretend you bought the whole company you invested in. You are unlikely to unload an entire company in 10 days after buying it and you should use the same approach with your investments.\n\nAll being said my advice is do your home work and dont listen to people who play on your emotions or fears. For those interested in some advice and dont wish to do any leg work invest in a simple low cost S and P 500 index fund or total market index fund. For those looking at ETFs that offer good returns and attempt to protect against market down turns I recommend investing in the SPDR Dow Jones ETF or Invesco Equal Weighted S and P 100 fund.\n\nFor those looking at actively managed funds that invest in companies with moats, engage in ESG practices, and engage in price and value discovery I recommend the parnassus core equity fund (expense ratio of 0.86%) and parnassus endeavor fund (expense ratio of 0.95%)\n\nFor those looking at individual stocks that are priced fairly, have moats, and are proven winners I recommend CMI DE, CAT, ETN, WM, RSG, MSFT, GOOGL, AMAT, TSM, KO, PEP, PG, COST, WMT, TGT, WMT, MCK, PFE, MRCK, JNJ, CERN, APD, BRK, ALL, PGR, BAC, TD, AXP to name a few. You can always buy Van Ecks MOAT ETF as well.\n\nGood luck investing and be smart with your money. Every investor needs to have a margin of safety please do your own self reflections and come to your own educated decisions about how to grow your wealth and achieve your long term goals.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, February 19, 2021**\n\nAfter opening the day higher, stocks pulled back throughout the session to finish in the red, closing out a very volatile week in the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.17% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed 0.44% down, and the Dow (DIA) closed 0.03% down. Even though the major indexes pulled back this week, they continue to hover near record levels as optimism over additional stimulus continues to fuel higher levels of risk tolerance among market participants. \n\nThere are many encouraging developments surrounding the coronavirus. This week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago, according to data analyzed by the New York Times. Furthermore, [analysis from Bloomberg on Thursday ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/how-many-vaccine-doses-are-available-u-s-should-see-a-surge?srnd=premium)showed that the U.S. vaccine supply is poised to double from the current rate of 10 million to 15 million doses per week within the next few weeks, allowing more shots to be given in the near-term.\n\nThursday night, in an interview with CNBC, Treasury Secretary Yellen said a large stimulus package is still necessary to build up sufficient momentum for economic recovery to take off on its own. She said, \u201cWe think it\u2019s very important to have a big package \\[that\\] addresses the pain this has caused \u2013 15 million Americans behind on their rent, 24 million adults and 12 million children who don\u2019t have enough to eat, small businesses failing. I think the price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big. We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run,\u201d she added.\u201d \n\nDespite a record low supply and a temporary pullback in December, the housing market remains very strong. According to a report by the National Association of Realtors, sales ended the month of January at a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 6.69 million units. That figure is 0.6 higher than December and 23.7% higher when compared with January 2020 and the second-highest sales pace since April 2006.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed on Friday to press ahead with laws to force Facebook (FB) to pay news outlets for content, saying he had received support from world leaders after the social media giant blacked out all news media in the country. The US State Department said it sees the dispute as a business matter between a company and a country and is unlikely to get involved.\n* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by Argus from $155 to $180 at Buy. Stock currently around $158\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target is $140 at Overweight. Stock currently around $113\n* Arista Networks (ANET) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target around $350 at Outperform.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, February 12, 2021**\n\nAfter pulling back for four consecutive days, stocks rose Friday to fresh record levels, closing out back-to-back weeks of gains. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.49% higher, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.56% higher, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.11. Despite bouts of volatility and speculative excess in recent weeks, the market has continued to hover around record levels, buoyed by favorable fiscal and monetary policy, a push for more fiscal stimulus, strong corporate earnings, and progress in the pace of vaccinations. \n\nWith results in from around 75% of companies in the S&amp;P 500, more than 80% of the companies beat earnings estimate by an average of 15.2%, according to a study by FactSet. Profits from companies in the stock index are now expected to have grown 2.8% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, a sharp improvement from the decline of more than 9% that was projected at the end of December. . Strangely, companies that beat earnings estimates have not been rewarded and instead lagged the broader market by an average of 0.5%. John Butter, the author of the analysis said, \u201cTo date, the market is not rewarding positive earnings surprises and punishing negative earnings surprises less than average. Companies that have reported positive earnings surprises for Q4 2020 have seen an average price decrease of -0.5% two days before the earnings release.\u201dTo date, the market is not rewarding positive earnings surprises and punishing negative earnings surprises less than average. Companies that have reported positive earnings surprises for Q4 2020 have seen an average price decrease of -0.5% two days before the earnings release through two days after the earnings release. This percentage decrease is well below the 5-year average price increase of +0.9% during this same window for companies reporting positive earnings surprises.\u201d\n\nMore positive developments coming out of Washington regarding stimulus. Multiple House committees have approved parts of Democrats\u2019 $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief, such as the $1,400 direct payment to Americans and the extension of key federal unemployment programs. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters she thinks the House will approve the bill \u201cbefore the end of the month \\[February\\].\u201d While Republicans have raised concerns about passing another massive spending bill, the Democrats used a process called reconciliation that would allow them to advance the bill without any Republican support. Reconciliation is a way for Congress to enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with only a majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires 60 votes to overcome. Because Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate\u2014plus a Democratic vice president\u2014reconciliation is a way to get a tax-and-spending bill to the president\u2019s desk even if all 50 Republicans oppose it. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Bumble (BMBL) continued the momentum from its strong first trading day by rising more than 7% on Friday. \n* The White House said it was in \"active conversation\" with car companies, semiconductor companies, and foreign diplomats to try and solve the shortage of semiconductors that has forced the closure of several US car plants. \n* Amazon (AMZN) is suing New York's attorney general to prevent the state from potentially taking legal action against the company over its handling of worker safety during the Covid-19 pandemic and firing of one of its warehouse workers last year. The state \"lacks the legal authority it purports to wield against Amazon, \" the Seattle-based company said in the complaint, arguing that its operations are \"governed by federal law and enforced by federal regulators.\"\n* After the wild rise of Dogecoin (DOGE) in recent weeks, Billy Markus co-founder and co-creator said, \u201cPeople are talking about Dogecoin going to $1 \u2013 that would make the \u2018market cap\u2019 larger than actual companies that provide services to millions, such as Boeing, Starbucks, American Express, IBM. Does Dogecoin deserve that? That is not something I can comprehend, let alone answer. It went from a silly joke to something worth something to people very quickly, and a community was developing fast, with lots of shady people and lots of new people, quickly putting up services and infrastructure around it,\u201d Markus wrote.\n* Aurora Cannabis (ACB) target raised by Cantor Fitzgerald from $17 to $18. Stock currently around $14.\n* Applied Materials (AMAT) target raised by Wells Fargo from $125 to $135 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to Friday. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-19-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow futures bounce after biggest one-day February loss\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their biggest one-day losses in the red-hot month of February. The Dow, which broke a three-day winning streak and fell from a record closing high, remained on track for a positive week, which would be its third straight. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are riding three-day losing streaks and are on pace for their first losing weeks in the past three.\n\n&gt; * Bitcoin \u2014 which topped $52,000 this week \u2014 hit another all-time high early Friday near $53,000 per unit. After Tesla and other companies recently showed support for the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency, major financial firms also appeared to be warming to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Thursday she believes bitcoin is a \u201chighly speculative asset.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Treasury Secretary Yellen pushes for major Covid stimulus\n\n&gt; * As the House aims to pass its version of President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief blueprint by the end of next week, Yellen told CNBC that a large stimulus package is necessary to get the economy back to full strength. \u201cThe price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big,\u201d she said.\u201d We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run.\u201d Democrats hope to get their bill through Congress before March 14, when key federal jobless benefit programs expire.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Biden to pledge billions in global Covid vaccination aid\n\n&gt; * Biden is expected to announce Friday that the U.S. will spend $4 billion on international Covid vaccination efforts. He will make the pledge during his first virtual meeting as president with G-7 leaders. Biden will also urge other nations to put more money toward the global fight against the pandemic.\n\n&gt; * Later in the day, Biden travels to Michigan to visit Pfizer\u2019s vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, a trip that was supposed to happen Thursday but was postponed due winter weather. Biden made his first domestic trip as president Tuesday, traveling to Wisconsin for a CNN town hall on the coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Uber dealt a major blow as UK\u2019s top court rules drivers are workers\n\n&gt; * Shares of Uber dropped another 3% in the premarket after the Supreme Court in the U.K. ruled Friday that the company\u2019s drivers there should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. The ruling out of Britain ends an almost five-year legal battle between Uber and a group of former drivers there. Uber insists its drivers are self-employed and that it acts as more of an \u201cagency\u201d that connects them with passengers through an app. The company weathered a challenge in its home market of California in November, when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hailing drivers\u2019 status as independent contractors, not employees.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defends controversial Wall Street practice\n\n&gt; * During Thursday\u2019s GameStop hearing, Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defended a controversial method brokerages use to make money, and said his firm would adapt if new regulations prohibited the practice. Members of Congress spent much of their time prodding about \u201cpayment for order flow,\u201d a practice in which a brokerage receives payment from a market maker like Citadel, known as a dealer, for directing the order to them. This model is how Robinhood and other brokers are able to offer commission-free trading. \u201cI do believe that payment for order flow has been an important source of innovation in the industry,\u201d Griffin added.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nxHmaP5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GIRwl9k.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/VbE1lLY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/gGk8pg5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8AYKTCG.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yYi6DTL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BRv9eiQ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1SY4cN7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/nYlYObU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/2jBrK42f/divical1.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* UAVS\n* FRX\n* BFARF\n* PLTR\n* ROKU\n* GSAH\n* UBER\n* EBON\n* BNB.X\n* TDAC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-deere-dropbox-novavax-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Deere (DE)** \u2013 The heavy equipment maker earned $3.87 per share for its fiscal first quarter, compared to a consensus estimate of $2.14 a share.

        "selftext": "Do you want a stock that can give you more ROI than an ETF, without taking on the inherent risk that AMC, NOK or BB has? Do you believe in the clean energy sector in general, but want a solid company that is well positioned to outperform the sector as a whole? ***SolarEdge Technologies*** is the answer to your prayers, and here's why.  \n\n\n# The Stock\n\n\\-  The stock currently trades at 330.89$ with a 50-day moving average of 317$ and up from 140$\\~ same time last year. So obviously it has grown significantly, but not more than the market as a whole, with a beta(5y) of 0.99 showing it has actually followed the market incredibly closely.    \n\\-  In terms of volatility it is rather stable with an avg volume of 1.2 million (2.47%) meaning it's not a great play for day traders generally but promising for long-term investors that are risk-averse.  \n\\-  Additionally it's not a shortsqueeze play as only 4.77% of the shares are shorted (2.4mil).   \n\\-  Their P/E ratio ttm is at 98,6 which is rather high, but more a result of the current market than the individual company as their competitors has an average P/E ratio ttm of 106 which is also dragged down significantly by  **Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)**  which has a ha P/E ratio ttm of 17.6. Moreover, SEDG's forward P/E ratio is at 72.4  \n\\-  Their PEG ratio (5y) however is only at 3.71 with their competitors much higher at 5.396 which goes to show that their expected growth is much higher than their competitors. And personally i prefer PEG when considering growth companies, so i put more faith in this number than P/E ratio.\n\nIn general I feel the ticker is not comparatively overvalued when you look at the clean energy sector as well as their direct rivals such as Enphase. and it doesn't have the same risky factors that often come with many ticker DD's such as BB, AMC or GME.\n\n# 'The Company\n\nAs for the company itself, they have a revenue stream of 1.52B with a  GAAP gross margin of 32% which is both a really strong margin as well as much more stable than their main competitor Enphase which has only very recently turned profitable. They also only have 615M in debt while have over 1.1B in total cash. Those two factors combined, leave a lot of room to keep growing in the future, while indicating that they already know how to stay profitable. \n\nAdditionally the company has the majority market share in the US as well as a very large market share in europe. They are much more geographically diversified compared to other competitors such as Enphase or SolarCity which are primarily operate in the US.\n\nThey are headquartered in Israel which is the main hub for technology outside of silicon valley, and their management is comprised of Zvi Lando (CEO), Ronen Faier (CFO), Uri Bechor (COO), Meir Adest (CPO &amp; CIO), Amir Fishelov (CSA), Ilan Yoscovich (CTO) and Yogev Barak (CMO). In general the management team is a competent team. While none of them are eccentric figures such as Ryan Cohen , Elon Musk or Steve Jobs, they all have a lengthy resume within their respective fields and have stayed consistent with their plan and are very systematic and aggressive with their expansion strategy. As a highlight, the CEO, Zvi Lando has been CEO since September 2019 and before that he was the excetutive VP of sales for SolarEdge Technologies. His education is as an engineer from a prominent techonological university in Israel and before he joined SEDG he was an engineer, process diagnostic manager, and general manager at Applied Materials Inc, where he worked for 15 years. Applied Materials Inc is also a technological company that focusses on chip production, Semiconductors, flat panel displays for computers, smartphones and tv's as well as photovoltaic systems (Solar panels). \n\nAs for partnerships they are partnered with Flextronics International Ltd. which is the third largest global electronics manufactorer, located in Singapore which allows them to operate at a cheaper price, while providing excellent products due to their highly educated populace and great infrastructure.  \nThey are also partnered with Tesla(SolarCity) in development of Photovoltaic systems and energy storage (batteries) which is a huge boost as Tesla has a ton of techonological advantages when it comes to Lithium batteries.   \nThey also accuired a majority stake in Kokam, a South korean Battery producer with the expressed purpose of increasing their production capabilities for batteries as well as furthering their battery techonlogy.   \nLastly, they also partnered up with  Schneider Electric to capture markets further in Europe and and NA.\n\nThe company is also backed by prominent institutional investors and venture capital such as GE, JP morgan, Norwest, Lightspeed, Genesis Opus Capital.\n\n# The Product(s)\n\nSEDG has 5 main products, all of them interconnected to a certain degree.\n\nThe products are their Power Optimizers, Inverters, Monitoring Portal, Installer Tools and Batteries (energy storage)\n\nStarting from the ground up, we can start with the Power Optimizers.   \nNormal PV systems (Solar panels) function by adjusting a solar installation as a group (multiple panels) to ensure that none of them \"overproduce\" energy that the collective system cannot contain and or produce, essentially meaning that the panels adjust to the lowest common denominator. SEDG power optimizers are embedded into each individual panel, and combined with the inverters, allow for  Maximum Power Point Tracking for each panel, meaning that they all produce the maximum amount they are able to. Normal PV systems are hindered by multiple factors such as partial shade, uneven soiling, or conversely if they exceed standard inverters permissible  voltage range. Additionally, the Power Optimizers also transmit concurrent measurements and data of each panel. (this will be important later)\n\nThis leads nicely into the inverters, which in conjunction with the power optimizers also functions by the same principle of maximizing each panels performance allowing conversion from DC to AC at various levels for each panel. This allows for a maximum performance of 97% efficiency compared to 68.7%-86.8% efficiency. \n\nThe Installer Tools is a software tool that helps with the installation, that automatically recommends string layout, inverter and power optimizer selection in accordance with the given projects size, location, and specific circumstances. Moreover, it also provides a configuration tool that allows for remote and on site verification of correct installation in real-time and provides a virtual map of the PV system on site.\n\nAfter installation they also offer a Monitoring Portal that allows for easy tracking through either smartphone or computer. The product alerts the user when issues occur ranging from site-wide issues all the way down to each module. The portal, like the installer tool, creates a virtual map of the site allowing for easy problem identification remotely, making it much easier to deal with commercially as they'll know exactly what, who and how much/many to dispatch to solve the issue. Additionally, the service is entirely free for the user and cost little to nothing for SEDG. This has proven hugely beneficial compared to Enphase which had a subscription service that performed poorly, they then made it free, but almost immediately had to change it to an upfront cost, to stay profitable. This has not been an issue for SEDG as mentioned earlier. \n\nLastly, their battery technology is almost at a point where they can use it commercially to store energy when peak supply is reached doing the day, and then sell it doing bottom supply, meaning they avoid the fluctuations of solar energy that plagues the industry. Now, obviously they already have the technology for this, that is not revolutionary. However, what is consequential is that they've almost hit a point where it is profitable. The cost of providing the grid with energy at bottom supply from peaker plants is much more expensive than normal power plant production, and the cost of battery storage for SolarEdge is at the turningpoint of being more cheap than those peaker plants, which will revolutionize clean energy as a whole, and being one of the first companies to achieve it will result in absurd growth.\n\n# The Market &amp; Politics\n\nFinally, the major concern I personally have about SEDG is a general concern for an upcomming bear market/recession. However, as their products are primarily utility providers they are not as exposed to a recession and will not see their revenue drop. Moreover, in the event of a recession I believe that Clean Energy will be one of the sectors that Biden and Europe will attempt to pump money into similarly to the massive road and infrastructure spending that generally occurs doing recessions.   \nAnd outside of a bear market/recession we know that Biden is huge on clean energy and aims to transform the US into a zero-emission country sooner rather than later. Similarly many European countries are adopting or have already adopted the same goals.  \n\n\n\\*Position I have 300$ (2%) of my portfolio currently in SEDG, and will buy 2500$ (will then be 18.6%) on tuesday.   \n\\* Tuesday at 4:30 PM EST SEDG releases their 4qtr earnings report, and it's largely expected to great with 7% increase in revenue compared to last qtr.",

        "selftext": "$TSM - I am in with a cost average at $102. I first invested in it at  $50 but since sold that position was able to re-enter and stayed with my positions at $76 and $103. With 36 shares total I am excited and hopeful this TSM with continue to rally. It even pays a 1.59% Annual Dividend but comes with a small foreign tax fee, my latest tax fee was $.19.\n\nThey have purchased land in Arizona for $89 million to manufacture 5nm chips and they expect production can start in 2024 and the project will continue to 2029 with an estimated cost at $12 billion dollars. With expectations of 4nm and 3nm being manufactured by 2022. The P/E is slightly higher than the average with earnings just shy of the average. So your paying a premium but for the largest semiconductor manufacture with a market cap at $715B you also get an advantage in the market with a respectable stock price history, market exposure and a positive future with increasing ability to manufacture more chips in the upcoming years.\n\nI don't think TSM is far away from hitting the $150 and beyond. [Stockinvest.us](https://Stockinvest.us) has price projections near $200 in the next 3 months. I am not too concerned with the timeline but honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it hit $150 next week.

        "selftext": " \n\n$TSM - I am in with a cost average at $102. I first invested in it at $50 but since sold that position was able to re-enter and stayed with my positions at $76 and $103. With 36 shares total I am excited and hopeful this TSM with continue to rally. It even pays a 1.59% Annual Dividend but comes with a small foreign tax fee, my latest tax fee was $.19.\n\nThey have purchased land in Arizona for $89 million to manufacture 5nm chips and they expect production can start in 2024 and the project will continue to 2029 with an estimated cost at $12 billion dollars. With expectations of 4nm and 3nm being manufactured by 2022. The P/E is slightly higher than the average with earnings just shy of the average. So your paying a premium but for the largest semiconductor manufacture with a market cap at $715B you also get an advantage in the market with a respectable stock price history, market exposure and a positive future with increasing ability to manufacture more chips in the upcoming years.\n\nI don't think TSM is far away from hitting the $150 and beyond. [Stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us/) has price projections near $200 in the next 3 months. I am not too concerned with the timeline but honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it hit $150 next week.

Until we stop using phones, computers, anything with a PCB in it, that industry will grow.\n\nAnyone have good long plays in there? I think the top companies would be chip makers, chemical companies, and then the real secret area, all the companies that make automation for the semiconductor process (Applied Materials, TEL, LAM Research, etc). I'm also interested in analytical chemistry related companies. That science will be critical in developing better chips. The chip makers are really limited by chemical cleanliness. Last I will also mention laser ablation.\n\nWho's got anything?",

        "selftext": "Hi! I've been getting into investing a lot recently, and I'm doing this mainly for my own experience. I'll take any feedback or comments y'all have. Let me know what you think of my first list!\n\nTo start off, I want to disclose how I picked this list. I used Morgan Stanley's stock screener to find tickers with their \"overweight\" rating and a price below their given price target (if applicable). Next, I would cross-reference that with RH and Zack's stock analysis. Finally, I would search for each ticker on Reddit in order to see what the sentiment towards the stock was. After compiling the list, I went through each stock individually again and assigned it a ranking of 1-5 (1 being safe, 5 being more speculative/risky), as well as providing a hypothetical dollar amount that I would invest in at the current price.\n\nThe goal of this list was to pick a balanced portfolio between aggressive growth and long term consistency. I have a huge bias towards semiconductors, biomedical, tech, and industrial/material.\n\nI'll start with the stocks I gave a 1 rating\n\n1. MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, FB, AAPL ($8k in each)\n\nI believe these will be here for a loooong time as well as continue to grow. These seem pretty safe to me and make up the foundation of this portfolio\n\nNow we get to stocks with a 2 rating. These are my favorites, as I see them having high growth potential and staying power (still riskier than 1s, however)\n\n2. NVDA, AMD, TXG, AMAT, MT, VALE, RTX, TDG, QRVO, NIO, TSLA ($5k in each)\n\n Now we get on to the 3s! These will follow a similar pattern of higher risk, less amount invested.\n\n3. TER, LRCX, ON, MCHP, FSLY, CRSR, RDSB, DOCU ($3k in each)\n\nNow we get to the 4s. These are mostly speculative\n\n4. SPCE, ANTM, NET, ACAD, ABCL ($2k in each)\n\nThat list was pretty short. The 5s will be the most risky/most speculative. They will have the lowest amount invested in them.\n\n5. TGH, SEDG, HUM, AMKR.\n\nOh and positions: 20 VOO, 62 QQQ, 28 LIT, and 54 PLTR. If you made it to the end of this post, thank you!",

It is incredibly difficult to find long entries at current price levels, not to mention social media is trying to get EVERY  stock below a buck over one dollar. Tread lightly out there, as I still feel a correction coming on. My first three pics are small cap companies, BUT they are between $8-$12 which is above r/pennystocks definition of a penny stock. I would rather give you a setup I believe in then shove a cheap stock down your throat. Hoping my OTC plays recently (VEPR and ENZC) have benefitted you greatly.   \n\n\n***$COTY:***\n\nShares of  Coty Inc.  (COTY) rose 2.9% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the beauty products company reported fiscal second-quarter adjusted profit that declined less than expected, while sales fell a bit shy. The net loss for the quarter to  Dec. 31  widened to  $275.4 million , or  36 cents  a share, from from  $21.1 million , or  3 cents  a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share fell to  17 cents  from  27 cents , but was above the FactSet consensus of  7 cents . Revenue declined 15.9% to  $1.415 billion , just below the FactSet consensus of  $1.433 billion , as sales in the  Americas  and EMEA ( Europe ,  Middle East  and  Africa ) regions missed expectations while  Asia Pacific  beat. The company said despite continued disruptions to sales and short-term orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it will start raising commercial investments ahead of fiscal 2022, while the company raised its full-year cost cutting target to  $300 million . The stock has soared 78.4% over the past three months through Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 10.3%.\n\nLackluster earnings BUT the chart speaks for itself. Will be looking for an entry after the stock falls back down to previous resistance turned support, which tends to happen on a lot of these flags. Stock is still trading well under pre-pandemic levels.\n\n*Processing img lf6y7m3p6gg61...*\n\n***$LLIT: (Update)***\n\nLLIT merging with Newegg, presented us with a dip into the 20ma for an entry in the 6.20's, and has since been silently chugging in the background.
