        "selftext": "\u201c\u201cWe think Intel is benefiting from an improving macroeconomic climate versus company-specific improvements at this time,\u201d wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves, who rates Intel\u2019s stock at underperform but took his price target up to $56 from $48. If his thesis is correct, Steves said Intel would simply be riding a \u201crising tide\u201d that\u2019s lifting all data-center competitors, and he expects rivals Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.12%  and AMD to keep outperforming Intel by picking up share.\u201d\n\nWhen Micron reported earnings in December they announced the bottom of the semiconductor market. And, they believe with their recent expansion in sales that the market it finally turning up due to 5G. With 5G more things are going to go into the cloud than we have now and new businesses will be born from this. You need data centers to power this. Micron makes the drives to hold the data for the data centers. AMD and Intel make the CPUs to process the data. \n\nIntel reported 1 billion in growth from the cycle turning out. Analysts are shrugging their shoulders because the conference call said they will experience a down turn in the second half, which is strange for a company that just beat by 1 billion. The banks grilled Intel about this and they answered that it is due to competition and they made their numbers \u201cconservative.\u201d\n\nAMD has released beefy 64 core processors so much cheaper than Intel and on 7nm technology, which Intel said won\u2019t have until 2021. This is why AWS and Azure and even Google Cloud are buying so many of these processors. They get better margins for their investors and they get better efficiency. If the whole market is going up AMD has the most to gain because of this. \n\nWhat do y\u2019all think?",
