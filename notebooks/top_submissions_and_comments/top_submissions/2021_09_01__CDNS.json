        "selftext": "This is an unplanned supplement to my prior DD on the eve of Rocket Lab\u2019s de-spac. \n\nI had dozens of comments listing key points/catalysts that I had initially missed, because I was keen on being the first to post a legal DD about rocket lab (SPACs aren\u2019t allowed so when I first posted it months ago, it was taken down). In addition, there has been interesting news regarding the space launch industry as a whole, specifically with respect to satellite constellation launches for providing greater accessibility to affordable high bandwidth internet, all over the world (yay), and real-time global surveillance via satellites with 50cm camera precision (kinda &amp; oh no).\n\nNews\n1. Amazon Project Kuiper \ud83d\udd25 - Amazon had announced its own internet satellite constellation project to launch 3k satellites by 2026-2029. Initial 6 or 9 flights assigned to ULA. RKLB\u2019s constellation supporting rocket, Neutron, is set to be ready to launch in 2024, ready in time to *maybe* capture some business from Amazon IN ADDITION to all of the ISPs that are going to be banging launch providers doors down, to not get left out of the next great revolution in global internet coverage. \n2. RKLB\u2019s space systems business \ud83d\udc40 - RKLB just announced it had signed a deal to supply reaction wheels \u201cfor a number of undisclosed satellite constellations.\u201d AFAIK satellites need 3 reaction wheels to control their orientation on all 3 axes (keeping a 4th as backup). Their production facility at initial capacity will output 2000 a year. 2000 / 4 == 500 satellites a year they are expecting to provision. For reference they\u2019ve only launched 100 satellites themselves so far.\n3. Astra (ASTR) \ud83d\ude2a - had 2 failed launches last weekend in a row, still haven\u2019t made it to orbit, still valued at about 1/2 that of rocket lab (what is wrong with this market). Launch reliability should have a premium, rocket lab has a proven track record of launch reliability.\n4. Firefly (private) \ud83d\ude2a - watching their livestream of launch right now, and it\u2019s not going too well (called an abort). But we\u2019ll see how it goes\u2026\n\nSome Key Upcoming Events\n1. September 8, Earnings \ud83c\udf7f - likely will hear status updates regarding larger neutron rocket, as well as their space systems business (please tell us about the contracts regarding reaction wheels mentioned above).\n2. Lunar Mission 2021 (probably Q4) \ud83c\udf1d - do I even have to say anything? What other space startup is set to fly to the moon this year, for NASA? What doors will this open for them \ud83d\udeaa?\n3. September-October, Back to back to back launches for global surveillance company Black Sky \ud83d\udc40 - this is very interesting as rocket lab has never turned around rockets this fast before. Demonstrating extremely rapid launch cadence will be proving to customer that they can schedule launch on demand essentially. In months, eventually weeks but not years. I expect to also see rocket lab demonstrate reusability of their electron rockets, by catching some with a helicopter (not joking) \ud83d\ude81.\n\nSummary:\n1. Rocket lab is in a much better position than other space startups that are either still in theoretical phase (never launched), and those that are trying to launch but just can\u2019t seem to get their rockets flying straight (Astra).\n2. Entrance of tech giants and ISP heavy weights into satellite constellation business is evidence that we are on the brink of a satellite launching party (from all ISPs to avoid getting amazoned, and want to keep their consistently high cash flow business models: Verizon, AT&amp;T, etc.). From all the launches, the planet might heat up a few degrees \ud83d\ude13.\n3. Their neutron rocket is being developed at the right time to compete with SpaceX for launch contracts for such constellations (I also really doubt any one launch provider has the bandwidth to take all the contracts).\n4. Their space systems business (reaction wheels for one), will be a nice revenue stream, even for the satellites that they don\u2019t launch themselves, yet still develop and produce key parts of.\n\nPositions/Disclosure: I have a lot of shares",

        "selftext": "Alright Apes, this is following on from my DD a few days ago, RKLB price has grown about 40% since then. Results have just been announced and there's some real nice stuff in there, I've tried to condense it a bit below and highlight the best bits.\n\nRevenue is not that high and this is to be expected, they're a growing company furiously investing in their future. Still profitable though which can't be said of SPCE, ASTR and Blue Origin. Backlog has shot up (137%), lots of work to keep them busy and keep the money coming in.\n\nThe most important thing is the amount of diversification. Their Space Systems business has grown significantly. They are quickly becoming a full service launch provider. You could argue they're more diverse than Space X in some regards. This is why I think they're such a safe long term bet. In the short term though, as more people are learning about them, the price is shooting up so there is money to be made. I'm personally targeting $30 a share short term and even that is conservative as that still values them well under SPCE at its' peak, and SPCE is nowhere near as valuable a stock as RKLB\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Revenue of $29.5M, representing 237% Year-on-Year revenue growth, accompanied by an expansion in gross margins from negative 67% to a* ***positive 13%****.*\n\n***Increasing diversity in revenue****, with Space Systems contributing 18% of total revenue in the period, compared to 3% in the prior year, accompanied with gross margins of 65%.*\n\n***Backlog grew 136% Year-on-Year to $141.4 million as of June 30, 2021 as compared to backlog of $59.9 million as of June 30, 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Entered into a contract with Varda Space Industries to manufacture and operate three Photon spacecraft to enable **in-space manufacturing**.\n* Entered into a contract with BlackSky Global for five Electron launches to support their **constellation growth**.\n* Entered into a study contract for a **Mars mission** that will see Rocket Lab develop two Photon spacecraft in support of the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory for a NASA science mission.\n* Successfully **recovered an Electron booster** for the second time, further advancing the program to make Electron a reusable launch vehicle to increase launch cadence and reduce cost per mission.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince June 30, 2021 Rocket Lab also:\n\n* Entered into a contract with Kin\u00e9is for five Electron launches to deploy their entire constellation of 25 satellites.\n* Signed launch services agreements to deploy satellites for Alba Orbital and Aurora Propulsion Technologies.\n* Began construction on a new **high volume production line capable of producing up to 2,000 reaction wheels per year** to support a growing number of contracts with constellation customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\npositions: 500 shares/average $10.50",
