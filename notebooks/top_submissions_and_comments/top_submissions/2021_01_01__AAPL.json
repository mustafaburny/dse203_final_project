        "selftext": "I get it, it\u2019s not the play. I\u2019m not saying sell your GME. I\u2019m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I\u2019m a regular guy who\u2019s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don\u2019t agree with me, just say so. \n\nI\u2019m also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks. \n\nBut, BUT, yesterday we did something they\u2019ve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That\u2019s what that big spike was, and that\u2019s why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it\u2019s too late. \n\nImpossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That\u2019s never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world. \n\n3516.16% of average trading volume. \n\nDo you get it? They\u2019ll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won\u2019t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. \n\nWhy do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don\u2019t want \u201cartificial\u201d spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That\u2019s why that spike went down right after the freeze.\n\nBut then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn\u2019t go down. The assholes who\u2019d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who\u2019d convinced them. \n\nEveryone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.\n\nWhat did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we\u2019re retards (they are correct). \n\nBut how come the price didn\u2019t go down? It\u2019s got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?\n\nBecause the retard brigade was buying it. There\u2019s 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that\u2019s 300m shares. \n\nNow imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets. \n\nAnd normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bubble that\u2019s going to crash on them. \n\nSo why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I\u2019m not saying sell GME). \n\nBecause GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who\u2019s just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.\n\nNot so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let\u2019s not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.\n\nYou know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why? \n\nWhat else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I\u2019m not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that\u2019s going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade \u2013 Do you think we\u2019re going to need more data this year than last year? \n\nRemember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn\u2019t handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?\n\nBut why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?   \n\n\nUS and Europe can\u2019t buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren\u2019t afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn\u2019t really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.\n\nWant proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to send them there.\n\nBut hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it\u2019s so great?\n\nAnswer: because Microsoft fucked them. That\u2019s right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who\u2019d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now. \n\nWorked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered. \n\nThe asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up. \n\nSo they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don\u2019t they have? Money. That\u2019s why they\u2019re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works. \n\nBut if we drive the share price up, do you think that\u2019s going to change? \n\nSo FUCK IT. I\u2019m in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I\u2019ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I\u2019ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.   \n\n\nTL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon. Go there with them.",

        "selftext": "# Ok retards listen up. Been seeing lots of cucks writing small DD pieces of bullish or bearish shit. You cucks need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.\n\nthis is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by Suck Elons Cock somehow.\n\nim also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates.\n\nTLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin doesnt affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **\ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**\n\nCompulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBasically been seeing posts about \"blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah\". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree cuck so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something\n\n# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.\n\nSo basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit idk im a virgin so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing mitosis on agar jelly \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nTHEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having \"Digital game exchanging\" or something, image below.\n\n*Processing img 2ba9j5d2zvb61...*\n\nHe also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\\_dd\\_buildapc\\_kiosks\\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)\n\nBUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?\n\n**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**\n\nThe expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.\n\nIn the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \\~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.\n\nWe are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.\n\nBurry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.\n\nGME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying \"omnichannel\" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.\n\nNow I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.\n\nHoldiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency. \n\n[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:\n\n&gt;At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.\n\nManiacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every cuck analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.\n\nSo in the headin i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \\(another reason shorts are fuk\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)\n\n&gt;The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)\n\nThis alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:\n\n9.8/2.48 = \\~3.95   3.95 \\* $35.5 = \\~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better. \n\nfrom [statista](https://statista.com) :\n\n&gt;Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.\n\nIf we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \\* 1.0224\\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!\n\nI really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout \"DigITaL\" or \"BlOCKbuSTER\" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those cucks special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10. \n\n**Bears are betting against:**\n\nRyan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion\n\nMichael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april\n\nu/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale\n\nReggie Fils-Aim\u00e9, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo\n\nSenvest, a mega fund thats actively managed\n\nNorweigan sovereign wealth fund\n\nFidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit\n\nAll of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears\n\nMicrosoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----&gt; Ryan Cohen dies.\n\n# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.\n\nOk everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.\n\nAlthough I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.\n\nThis squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.\n\n**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**\n\n*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.\n\n*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million\n\n% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020\n\n% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.\n\nSome [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.\n\nThe recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could by 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.\n\nGamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.\n\n*Processing img xsetax08pwb61...*\n\nNeed rockets \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80:\n\nOk so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts \"blockbuster\" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?\n\nOrtex data from Jan 4th 2021:\n\n*Processing img urqb3c3zbwb61...*\n\nSo this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \\~21 to \\~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.\n\nThese shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.\n\nNow for the data for this week:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ortex short data for Jan 14th for Gamestop](https://preview.redd.it/5ryumpl1dwb61.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb80c09e1be7b2f36f6d3745983cef4ce2b2df9b)\n\nSHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20. \n\nCost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.\n\nLongs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to \ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/).\n\n**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**\n\nYou realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.\n\n**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**\n\n**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img t8odq9btgwb61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 3nqb33f0hwb61...*\n\nThese two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.\n\nSomething else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nWe are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.\n\nRegardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.\n\n**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**\n\nBear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.\n\nKodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**\n\nVolkswagen went from **\\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**\n\nOverstock went from **\\~$21 to $123**\n\nBlue apron went from **$2.31 to $18** \n\nIve been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.\n\n$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \\* 1.0281\\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. \ud83c\udf11 .\n\nThis shit can happen. Hold on.\n\n**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 4ysv7bzclwb61...*\n\nBasically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price. \n\nThis happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.\n\nNow we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.\n\n**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme\\_gang\\_there\\_hasnt\\_been\\_a\\_short\\_squeeze\\_yet/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme_gang_there_hasnt_been_a_short_squeeze_yet/)\n\nIHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD\n\nIhor I quote:\n\n&gt;**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down \"Short squeeze has happend\" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.\n\nThe bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.\n\n**Conclusion: Buy shares with cash not margin. Hold shares forever unless RC dies (Shame hes a cybernetic demigod), Melvin bad, Shorts fuk, \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08  posting bearish shit are doing weeklies for the second time after they expired red on friday, GME to $200 without squeeze, Ryan cohen a god, GME is still a value play, Good luck have fun.**",

        "selftext": "Gamestonk. Gamestop. GME. My thoughts are on Reddit, under my u/martinshkreli &amp; subreddit r/martinshkreli. Those are authentic and discuss why GME is one of the most unprecedented events in market history. Here, I'm going to discuss the populist attitude that is creeping into this odd situation and add some thoughts on short-selling in general.\r\n  \nLet's cover my own unique angle on the concept of a 'short squeeze'. Most would define it as an erratic upward change in price driven by short-covering. I believe short-squeezes defined this way are usually a fictitious idee fixe that aggregates a number of discrete market behaviors and dynamics into a convenient and pithy moniker. The image of python-like buyer constricting some hapless speculator into a higher stock price is evocative but misleading. Many knew me as a short-selling specialist on Wall Street, focused on 'binary events' of biotech stocks. I think I've seen it all: I was once short more than 75% of a company's shares outstanding (I do not recommend this). I bought 75% of a company on the open market, etc.\r\n  \nShort-sellers are governed by the same market dynamics as longs. They get nervous when positions go against them and consider exiting. Like longs, they can double down if they wish. The only difference is that, of course, short positions grow when stocks rise. And they can rise infinitely, while long positions fall asymptotically to zero. But both get, theoretically and assuming no fundamental changes have occurred, more attractive as they move against the trader.\r\n  \nShort sellers have to pay borrow fees to longs (typically tiny, but sometimes massive). They have to locate stock to short, again usually easy, but sometimes difficult. Both are perilous when those rare adverse times arise. Why? Despite the possibility of a growing cost of renting stock, the ultimate fear of a short-seller is a \"buy-in\". It is nightmarish and has only happened to me once or twice, excluding options-related activity. A buy-in occurs when a broker decides to forcibly exit the short position on behalf of the trader because the broker and trader cannot secure the 'locate' which is supposed to underlie the short sale. The buy-in order is typically violently disruptive: a market order for the whole position near the closing hours of the market! The SEC published a list of stocks at risk of buy-in: the fail to deliver list.\r\n  \nMy point is that a 'short squeeze' can only practically affect the trader for two reasons. The first is that the trader digs in, doubles down and doesn't exit as his position grows. That's bad trading, and will eventually blow the trader up. But, if the stock is a 'good short', that short will be replaced by more traders with stronger hands/a better entry price/smaller position. What's more is the average investor can't tell if this is happening! The second is the buy-in. I haven't heard GME shorts being bought in, but again, how would you know, other than the grapevine? My point is most of the disruptive, exciting trading here is simply long speculators banging away at the stock.\r\n  \nNew longs are sometimes attracted to rising prices, speculating they'll increase further: that's called momentum. Those buyers are typically offset by the existing longs who are excited to exit at higher prices. But, if there is a large short position in the stock, a speculator may feel that those covering (buying to get out) short-sellers will provide additional fuel to the momentum. That's sometimes the case, but higher prices should lead to more supply from both long and short sellers. My feeling is the actions of large long holders probably have more influence on the stock price than shorts who dart in and out, and typically in smaller size. Remember that shorts who capitulate are often just replaced by new shorts who are attracted at the new lunar prices.\r\n  \nIn essence, 'short squeezes' become a self-fulfilling prophecy as new long investors pile in trying to 'squeeze' this sometimes phantom of a short seller, and existing long investors may hold off selling for the same reason. With some Popperian skepticism you will easily see that the same dynamic can exist without the short boogeyman, or with a short boogeyman of any size. Speaking of which, where is Chanos and his slavish groupie, Carson Block? \r\n  \nSpeculative momentum can occur for any reason. Let's not forget that the 'trapping shorty' strategy is an awkward idea for a few reasons. Short sellers are often sophisticated market participants who are betting on the decline of a stock. You usually don't want these type of traders sniffing around your favorite longs: I recall writing a 'short report' on a stock to watch it fall 50% that day. If you do a study of stock returns of highly shorted stocks, they are pretty awful. The reason there is 'no arbitrage' is the borrow rate. \r\n  \nBut even if you got this poor short to capitulate and squeeze, the amount of buyers who are now holding stock at absurdly high prices put way more energy (and money) into the stock than the short seller's white towel ever could. A sledgehammer killed the fly: now what? Alternatively, are you the host or the parasite?\r\n  \nOn populism. I don't really think most investors or speculators should go into any investment thinking that there is 'an enemy'. Concentrated (big) investments (bets) give rise to emotional behavior, typically the enemy in trading and investing as it clouds rational thinking. It's a lot better to be Socratic with your 'opponent' and understand what they're thinking. If your position were to be half the size it currently is, would you be as emotionally interested? Try it! You'll lower your risk and feel better.\r\n  \nSome of the behavior going on at WSB sounds more jihadist than speculative. The idea that there are some investors who are 'good' and others who are 'bad', or that there is an 'establishment' is BS. Everyone has the same goal: I have a pile of money, I'm trying to make it bigger, fuck your pile--I don't care about it. Anything other goal is contrived, foolish and won't help you win. You can't 'fight the rich' by trying to become one of them. Don't you see the irony? A related thought experiment: what if this trade continued to work really well? And another, and another? Then some WSBers are billionaires. Aren't they the new 'enemy/establishment?'\r\n  \nWho do you think hedge fund managers are? They're typically the anti-establishment. Things have changed a bit, but the most successful HFMs are actually the WSBers of the past. These are guys who didn't fit in well at i-banks, often got kicked out for having big mouths or not wearing the right ties, or just wanting to wear jeans at work and not fill out TPS reports. When they started their firms, people like Soros, Icahn, Steinhardt, Robertson, Cohen, Griffin, Loeb (who has posted anonymously on boards), Samberg, even Cramer were fish out of water and had very tiny amounts of capital, often begging for investors.\r\n  \nThe need for an enemy. To sustain increasingly insane behavior, it isn't uncommon to use a straw man or a scapegoat. Oppressive regimes used this technique in the past, and the media uses it today. Retail investors don't have much power individually. With your $5k RH account, you can't day trade or even qualify for margin. It's pitiful. So, it's understandably quite exciting to finally feel like a 'player' that you read about. To be a part of 'something'. The problem is the media is goading you to be somewhere between a lemming and a life-agnostic but impotent jihadist. Blowing yourself up won't impress anyone, and there is no afterlife here, other than a minimum wage career and mom's sofa. GME and shorting in general is small potatos in the scheme of the Wall St. machine. Don't worry about getting 'even' with the rich. That's jousting at a windmill that will waste your energy.\r\n  \nNo one here, hopefully, wants to be a lemming. Those willing to 'die on this hill' have to realize something: Wall Street doesn't care about its speculators. The new traders who vanquish the old simply replace them. Nothing changes. When LTCM blew up, or Amaranth, Visium, Galleon, or anyone else, it is 'out with the old and in with the new'. So, perhaps WSB can blow up 1 hedge fund or maybe 5, but so what? Eventually, the tables will turn and it will blow up. The leveraged, fast-money trading markets are a violent place and the only people who care one whit are the brokers charging fees (directly or indirectly). They only care to make sure the sorry carcasses can pay their bills. They know there will always be another speculator lined up, ready to shove his money into the lotto machine. There is no pride here. There is no credit for being a good solider. You either survive or you don't. Your job is to survive and thrive. Becoming a lemming will guarantee failure as per the statistical truism of gambler's ruin (enjoy the proof in measure theory). With enough time, anyone playing a game with &lt;50% success rate (equal payouts), will lose all their money. Get that number above 50%. Add the Kelly Criterion to your trading strategy.\r\n  \nYou might ask, \"(that's all well and good OR we'll agree to disagree) but, Mr. Shrek, isn't this a good trading strategy? (ganging up on shorted stocks)?\" As long as you're not a lemming/jihadist (willing to walk over the cliff, whether or not you have a \"cause\"), and you ignore a somewhat slimy ethical/market manipulation question, I don't see anything wrong with it. There are better ways to make money, since you're asking. Stoking (or worse, participating in) a buying frenzy that is akin to a forced musical chairs game is a little crazy. Once a stock is absurdly valued, you're just hoping the sell-off doesn't happen while you're holding it. If you have enough lemmings or jihadists 'helping you', that's a good thing. They will hold your bag--someone needs to. \r\n  \nOf course, if you've found the \"next\" Microsoft or Apple, no one needs to hold any bags. But, no company can increase its objective (aka fair) value quickly enough for this... phenomenon? situation? absurdity?... to make it reasonable. Those things take years, go slow and steady, and this frenzied buying/\"short squeeze\" phenomenon won't let value play a factor. That's why WSB GME longs have shifted theses from \"well, Gamestop was/is cheap\" to \"the gaming cycle\" to \"Ryan Cohen will save us\" to \"...jihad?!\"\r\n  \nEach member of the herd has its own financial parameters, too. Some may have $500, some $50,000,000 or more. Some may be willing to lose their entire stake (and even more) on an out-of-the-money or levered trade. Some are not. Some were in the latter and somehow end up in the former. Some are in one column at one price and another column at another--some are switched from column to column by force. Today's lemmings/jihadists are tomorrow's sellers. When you're hanging off the mountain, pay attention to the guy holding the rope.\r\n  \nLoosely 'coordinated' buying can certainly affect stocks. Heavily shorted stocks and small cap stocks are the kind that require less capital than typical to 'move' a stock. The irony here is when putting on a position, the trader's goal is typically NOT to move the stock with his actions!\r\n  \nI still think GME is wildly overvalued, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm 'bearish'. One funny idea here is reflexivity: GME stockholders may become serious GME customers and the company's fundamentals improve that way! Excluding some such miracle, eventually GME stock will trade at &lt;50 again. I still think it will trade at 1,000 or more BEFORE that happens, and that the decline process will take a long, long time (several years). Keep in mind, anything can change. GME can do serial secondaries that destroy its stock. Management's job is to create value for their shareholders--but perhaps they will avoid pissing them off. There's a strange loop! Finally, the stock could be halted by the SEC or completely banned by brokers. Don't overdo it. Watch the borrow rate. Keep your positions at less than 25% of your capital--live to play another day. \r\n  \nDisclosure: I've never traded GME stock and do not intend to.\n\n(From martin, posted by mo)",

        "selftext": "**NOTE: By \"next TSLA\" I mean a stock that grows far beyond what talking heads think is \"reasonable\". Not that they are company *like* TSLA or that they will see similar returns.**\n\n---\n\nBB has some elevated short interest for sure. That short interest may even be increasing. However the float on the stock is massive compared to GME. There are over 550 million available shares of BB, and the short interest is below 100%. While there may be some movement up based on shorts covering, GME is a once in a lifetime thing.\n\nNothing is the next GME. Not AMC, not NOK, not BB. The large players aren't ever going to be caught this way again in a place where retail investors can screw them, and GME isn't over. If what you want it to participate in that, then you should buy GME.\n\nBut I think BB is *fundamentally* more valuable than its current price.\n\n## Current Situation of the Company\n\nBlackBerry, which started as Research In Motion, was the \"original\" smartphone company, before Apple ate them alive. They didn't have the product pipelines or the money to compete against Apple, and the company was nearly killed by the iPhone and later the Samsung Galaxy brand.\n\nOver the last several years, BlackBerry has pivoted into a software security company. They mainly sell security products with a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nFrom Fidelity:\n\n&gt; BlackBerry Limited provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments worldwide. The company leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver solutions in the areas of cybersecurity; safety and data privacy; and endpoint security management, encryption, and embedded systems.\n\nOver the last year, BB has re-positioned itself to take advantage of the nascent market of autonomous and intelligent vehicles. (Source: [AWS and BlackBerry QNX join forces to accelerate auto innovation with BlackBerry IVY, a new intelligent vehicle data platform](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/aws-and-blackberry-qnx-join-forces-to-accelerate-auto-innovation-with-blackberry-ivy-a-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform/))\n\n&gt; BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences as well as provide valuable product insights back to the manufacturer.\n\nThey also have a partnership with Baidu for that company's Apollo autonomous driving open platform. (Source: (BlackBerry Expands Partnership with Baidu to Power Next Generation Autonomous Driving Technology)[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology])\n\n&gt; BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with Baidu, whose high-definition maps will run on the QNX\u00ae Neutrino\u00ae Real-time Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of GAC Group (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.).\n&gt; \n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; The QNX Neutrino RTOS foundation for Baidu\u2019s high-definition maps is a robust real-time microkernel operating system that provides deterministic performance as well as flexibility to address the limited resources of the embedded system.\n\nTheir QNX system is already used in over 100 million cars that are currently on the road, including a direct partnership with [Ford](https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/article/22007012/blackberry-ford-extend-partnership-to-develop-car-software) that they've had since 2016.\n\nThey are in the final stages of completing an amazing turnaround as a company, and it looks like they have a good chance of doing it successfully. So what are the challenges?\n\n## Balance Sheet Issues\n\nBB has almost 2/3 of their current \"assets\" tied up in patents. This can be seen on their 2019 balance sheet as \"Intangible Assets \u2013 Total: $2.352 billion\". Their assets which are easier to liquidate are nearly exactly their current liabilities ($1.196 billion vs. $1.121 billion), as they added $638 million in debt in FY2019.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, BlackBerry sold 90 of its smartphone patents to Huawei. It also signed a licensing deal with OnwardMobility and Foxconn to allow it's name and software to be used in making a new 5G Android-powered smartphone that has a physical keyboard, filling a small but important niche in the smartphone industry that is mostly untapped at this point.\n\nThese moves signal the intent of BlackBerry to leverage parts of its balance sheet that have been mostly sitting idle since 2016 when they exited the smartphone market for good as a manufacturer.\n\nThe challenge is that their cash flow and income have been negative or paltry for quite a while. That was never going to turn around until they were able to monetize some of their existing IP and position the company for a solid market segment. At this point, they have successfully done both.\n\n## Earnings\n\nThis section definitely depends on your focus and perspective. For instance, BlackBerry's GAAP EPS has been negative more than positive since 2016. But on the other hand, their adjusted actual EPS has beaten consensus estimates for every single quarter going back to Q3 2015.\n\nIf you believe in Chen's ability to execute the turnaround, then this seems positive. If you think the company is destined for failure and a slow death, then this seems negative.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOverall, I think BB is undervalued at its current price. They are very well positioned to take off as autonomous vehicles become more common, and most importantly, they have extremely valuable partnerships in many different markets, including some fantastic access to the Chinese market through their partnership with Baidu.\n\nAutonomous vehicles are a market that doesn't exist yet. Not truly. But many people believe that autonomous vehicles are going to turn into a HUGE segment of the market over the next decade. While car companies (particularly TSLA) provide direct exposure to that, they come with manufacturing risks and other things such as supply-chain risks. TSLA, Toyota, Ford... they could all face issues that simply come down to \"we ran out of good suppliers of Cadmium\" or something similar, while what you want is exposure to autonomous vehicles.\n\nBB has none of that. Their revenue and exposure to the market is entirely within the software, and because of their wide range of partnerships they shouldn't be dependent on any particular manufacturer. I expect to see them reporting positive earnings during FY2021 (though only slightly), and a much more obviously robust performance in FY2022.\n\nTheir patent portfolio alone in 2020 was worth about what their market cap was, that's how undervalued this company was due to concern about earnings. Once those earnings turn around, I think the valuation based on *only* fundamentals should but the stock at about $20 *right now*, and about $30-$35 by the end of this year.\n\nThere is also a non-trivial chance of a purchase by another company such as Alphabet that wants access to their partnerships, patent portfolio, and machine learning software.\n\n---\n\nOverall, BB benefits from its meme-stock status, and a bit of a short squeeze could happen for sure. But based just on my reading of their business itself, I think the stock has room to as much as triple within a year.\n\nCurrent position disclosure:\n\n100 BB @ 14.2687  \n+4 19 FEB 21 15c @ 4.125  \n+2 19 FEB 21 40c @ 1.93  \n+1 19 MAR 21 25c @ 4.64",

        "selftext": "  \n\nTo everyone that held, you\u2019ve leveled to diamond-hand generals. In game theory, the only way you could have maximized your gains was if you all stuck together, and you did! They had counted on you guys scattering, and that\u2019s why they took out new shorts on GME.\n\nGME was on the cusp of a short squeeze on Wednesday, before they closed off all buying, and did the short ladder attack. \n\nIt shows that they\u2019ve learned nothing since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). They play by one primary rule: Heads we win. Tails you lose. And they can change the other rules last minute to drive to the primary rule.\n\nNext, they will try to block/limit buying across RH and more brokerages so there\u2019s not enough volume to drive to the short squeeze. Meanwhile Hedge Funds are free to buy/sell unlimited amount of shares and create short ladder attacks \\[1\\]. Different rules for different players in this game!\n\nBut let\u2019s move back to the whiteboard.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low (average \\~$67--I have to admit, the drop today was too tasty so my cost basis went up from yesterday)/share with my later buys averaged in), and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours. In this post I will go a little further and speculate more than I'd normally do in a post due to the questions I've been getting, so fair warning, some of it might be very wrong. I suspect we'll learn some of the truth years from now when some investigative journalist writes a book about it.*\n\nToday, I\u2019ll describe what a margin call is and explain a High Short Interestt trading strategy around it. In Particular, I\u2019ll use Melvin Capital presumed short book as a case study.\n\nNote: I\u2019m not a financial advisor, this is just me whiteboarding.\n\n# Long/Short Strategy\n\nIn the Hedge Fund industry they have a strategy called long/short. They go long on momentum stocks and short undesirable ones.\n\nIe buying Apple and shorting Gamespot.\n\nThis trade is profitable if Apple\u2019s stock price rises and Gamespot\u2019s (GME) share price decline.\n\nHowever, let say the trade doesn\u2019t go their way and Gamespot share prices dramatically because of a short squeeze. In this case their net position is negative. Let\u2019s say 30% negative. If it becomes large, their brokers calls them up and ask them to put more cash. Then they raise 30% more cash or sell stocks that been paid off to meet the reserve requirement. This is why you see the general stock market deep red, while GME moons. Hedge funds are selling their winning longs to raise cash for the margin requirement.\n\nWhen GME short squeezes, they may have to liquidate (sell off all their longs) and cover their existing short position. Moreover, they have other leverage short positions that are also highly shorted (&gt; 50% of the float). This becomes what\u2019s known as an arbitrage trade. I\u2019ll call it the High Short Interest (HSI) Trade. It\u2019s a high risk trade but with potential for very high profits/returns should it go your way.\n\n# The High Short Interest Trade\n\nShould Hedge funds start to cover short positions because of a margin call or liquidate, they will be forced to buy up shares in the open market. However, if those shares are scares, it will create a huge short squeeze in which they will have to pay higher prices to meet their obligation to return shares.\n\nI\u2019ll use Melvin Capital as a case study because they have publicly declared they had a high short interest in GME, so most likely be margin called or liquidiated, should the GME short squeeze happen.\n\nFurthermore, I\u2019ll analyze their possible short position to justify why the squeeze may happen. Again, this is all conjecture and thinking out a possible trading strategy\n\nIn this case study, a high short interest stock is defined as one in which the short interest is greater than 50%. The reason why we will focus on these stock is because of the difficult of buy back all the shares before the market discovers how these shares are valuable because you have to buy them back at any price to meet contractual obligations.\n\nGoing forward, everything I write is based on conjecture but backed up by evidence. Shorting is a opaque dark art and it\u2019s hard to get concrete data. But it shouldn\u2019t block us in this whiteboarding session.\n\nHere is a Melvin Capital possible short interest based on their sec filing of put positions \\[2\\]\n\n1. Gamespot (GME)\n\n2. AMC Networks (AMC)\n\n3. Dillards (DDS)\n\n4. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)\n\n5. The Macerich Company (MAC)\n\n6. Tanger Factory Outlet Center (SKT)\n\nI\u2019ll analyze short interest based on data from ortex.com \\[3\\]. This data is not confirmed but estimate and such has a possibility for high errors. However, ortex has been very reliable in the past.\n\n# AMC \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV](https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 63M\n\n Float: 102M\n\n % of float shorted 62%\n\n# Dillards (DDS)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB](https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 4.2M\n\n Float: 5.5M\n\n % of float shorted: 76%\n\n# Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL](https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL)\n\n  Estimate Short Interest: 58M\n\n Float: 109M\n\n % of float shorted: 54%\n\n# MAC\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP](https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 71M\n\n Float: 113M\n\n % of float shorted: 63%\n\n# SKT\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 48M\n\n Float: 90M\n\n % of float shorted: 53%\n\nAs you can see all these positions are heavily shorted, and should this hedge fund need to acquire shares of them on the market because of liquidation, it may have trouble to close out its short position. Hence, a very high likelihood of a short squeeze.\n\n# Short Ladder Attack\n\nA common maneuver Hedge fund deploy to vacuum up shares is a short ladder attack \\[1\\]. They do this to drop the price and scoop up shares. For hedge funds with big short positions this is effective because it makes it seem like the shares aren\u2019t valuable when they are.\n\nUsually, they will borrow 1-3% of shares and short, causing people to panic sell. If they do this repeatedly after like 10 days, they can close out 30% of their short position before the market notices. Do you see now how they can leverage 1% to scoop up 30% of the shares with this attack? It\u2019d be difficult for them to vacuum up all the shares at once without the price increasing or the market knowing, so they manipulate the price lower and do it over a period of time.\n\nThat is why you\u2019ll see the days to cover metric. Based on the volume, it suggest how many days they can get away with this before they are whole. However, should people realize that their short interest is too high, they can HOLD and buy more to force hedge funds to buy the shares at a higher price.\n\nBut you can see that the volume is increasing, so the market is aware of a potential short squeeze.\n\n# Short Squeeze Precedent\n\nIn the week of March 20, 2020, Blue Apron had a short interest of about 50%. And then they experienced a short squeeze which led the price to climb 1000% in a week. So you can see how explosive the share price can climb, should a short squeeze occur, for stocks with a short interest of 50% or greater.\n\nNever trade more than you\u2019re willing to lose. Diamond hands.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what\\_is\\_a\\_short\\_ladder\\_attack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what_is_a_short_ladder_attack/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F\\_X01/infotable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://ortex.com](http://ortex.com)",

        "selftext": "Good afternoon\n\nThe current market has some obvious similarities with the internet bubble in the 2000s at the moment:\n\n1) Sectoral bubble\n\nElectric Vehicle stocks, Renewable energy stocks, crypto and possibly even fintech stocks have skyrocketed to insane levels in 2020. A PE ratio of 100-200 for stocks in these sectors is considered \"cheap\" right now, that's what \"investors\" before the dotcom crash thought aswell.\n\n2) Historic low interest rates\n\nThis is the biggest catalyst for the creation of an insane bubble, very low interest rates. Just like in the 2000s, we currently have historic low interest rates, which makes stocks the only game in town. The big myth here is that people think stocks only go up, with interest rates close to 0. That's absolutely not true and that's the scary part in my opinion, because even professionals and analysts think that. The market doesn't stay disconnected from the economy forever.\n\n3) IPO mania and speculation\n\nWe haven't seen more IPO's in 2020 since the dotcom bubble. This on itself isn't a big deal, but the valuations these IPO's get are beyond insanity. Any company that gets linked to EV in some way, automatically gets a 100%+ boost to their stock price, without even having a product or sales number. 1999 all over again?\n\n4) \"New paradigm\"\n\nLet's be honest, at least 80% of the people in any financial subreddit (excluding WSB, +-99% there) thinks that Tesla is the new paradigm that will take over the world. Trust me, it is not. I've been doing some math on Tesla valuation, and I have no fitting word for its current valuation. I won't go in the details why, because I could write a whole book about this. I still firmly believe that growing positive cashflows should be the main catalyst of a stock that goes up, and a company with a negative cashflow (THAT ONLY GROWS AT A 25% RATE) shouldn't get a 1t valuation, that's too disrespectful for companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. \n\n6) Greed and FOMO\n\nEveryone wants to jump on this train, no one wants to miss out, but I can assure you, these valuations are absurd and those who can't get out early enough, will be left holding the (empty) bag.\n\nKind regards and stay safe (physically and financially)",

        "selftext": "Listen up.. \u201cIf you think BB moon\u2019d after this week, you\u2019re a rough brained retard. Our astronauts John Chen and Tom Eacobacci are literally in the break room; Chen\u2019s unpacking some homemade Yangzouh Fried Rice from his wife, Tom is microwaving stale coffee and asking Chen if he\u2019s going to change his name to Cha Ching after he becomes a Billionaire in 2023. Chen smirks as he cracks open his wheel of fortune cookie... the point is, rocket is still fucking grounded. I repeat, the rocket is grounded.\n\nListen retards, did you miss AMD? Did you miss NVDA? Did you miss trash ass Cringecoin? Hell, did you even miss TSLA? Are you seething with FOMO up to your ears and out of your assholes watching these stocks mint fresh millennial millionaires while you twiddled your thumbs thinking \u201cGeE WiZ tHeY haVe To CoMe DoWn EveNtuAlLYyyyYyyYy\u201d\n\nPro tip: they never came down...\n\nThese rockets went to the fucking moon and left your ass behind on planet Earth, living a shitty wage life flipping burgers, while the retards that boarded these rockets are on the moon laying on beach chairs, sunglasses on, and rubbing sunscreen with SPF 9000 on their smooth brains because they got front row tickets to the sun... FRONT ROW TICKETS TO THE FUCKING, SUN... this is the present state of affairs.\n\nThere is, lucky you, however, another rocket with the inscription BBC fueling up and selling tickets to the moon AS WE SPEAK.\n\nCurrent position: missionary with 10,555 shares and reverse cowgirl with some calls. I\u2019m holding unrealized profits of about $110k and realized profits of about $100k.\n\nHowever, if you ask me 10 years from now my biggest regret in life... I will tell you two things: 1, not getting my wife her bf earlier on, and 2, booking $100k profit too soon in BB.\n\nMay Lord Chen forgive my moment of weakness. Learn from me. Buy and walk away. Buy and hold. Do not be tempted to sell before the moon. To not sell when the rocket is still in the stratosphere.\n\nMoon is $50 IF THE STOCK JUST TRADES ON PAR WITH ITS FUCKING PEERS, MOON CAN EASILY BE $100+ IF YOU FACTOR IN VERTICALS, ECONOMIC MOAT, and a $450-750 billion Auto Data Market as stated in Mckinsey &amp; Company\u2019s report on Monetizing Auto Data. Yes that\u2019s not a mistake, the overall revenue pool from Global Auto Data monetization could be as high as $750 BILLION in 2030. This is the market BB has cornered and is about to squeeze by the balls. QNX was always the crown Jewel of all their verticals. This was always the master plan for the turnaround. We are on the fucking cusp of one of the greatest turnarounds in history.\n\nListen, I don\u2019t think some of you rough brained retards realize what is happening:\n\nAsk yourselves: why is the EV sector so hot? Why is every large tech corporation trying to get a piece of this Auto pie?\n\nYou wanna know why? Because when the computer first came out it took the space of entire fucking floors in a building to do simple calculations... when the cell phone first came out, you needed a fucking brief case just to carry it and looked like an absolute tool making a phone call, stopping everything you\u2019re doing, laying down your suitcase, opening it, taking out the brick, extending a massive antenna, LMFAO, what fucking tools boomers were... anyways, now look at the modern laptop and smartphone. Look at the revolutions these products went through to become cemented into our lives. Look at the markets these products opened up for us.\n\nNow, what current item is undergoing this type of revolution? You guessed it, you smooth brained criminal you, the Automobile. What was once dinosaur machinery unironically running on dead dinosaurs, is now making the revolution on the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today.\n\nAnd guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance? Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today, hint hint: it\u2019s the same company that\u2019s so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround: Revenue Growth.\n\nBlackberry. It\u2019s Blackberry. Babe berry. Member berry. The blacker the berry... the sweeter the juice boys.\n\n\u201cwhAt aBoUT GoOgLe aNd APpLe or TSLA TaKiNg OvEr the Auto OS mArKet\u201d\n\nListen retards, BlackBerry\u2019s MOAT is bullet proof. You know why?\n\nBecause what\u2019s the one thing Google, Apple, and TSLA have in common? They\u2019re actually in the fucking auto business.\n\nYou think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost? Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is?\n\nLet me demonstrate with the ol\u2019 lemonade stand analogy. Let\u2019s say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade. Next thing you know, Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand, and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes. You\u2019re fucked. Jimmy just took your business, your friends, your girl and her bf.\n\nYou need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade... so how will you do this? Are you gonna go up to Jimmy\u2019s stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy? Is that what a smooth brained person would do?\n\nNO, you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store, buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them, and while you\u2019re at it, buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your lemonade. Because fuck Jimmy, that\u2019s why.\n\nSpeaking of lemonade...\n\n\u201cwHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB?\u201d\n\nAndrew Left although the gayest bear of them all, actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA. He was early on that call, but he was right.\n\nBack to the lemonade moat:\n\nListen retards, Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple, Google, and TSLA are. You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS? Or you think these non techy auto dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS. Fuck no. Don\u2019t be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear \u201cDD\u201d\n\nBlackBerry is a third party corporation that all auto makers can form an auto cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord. A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they\u2019re a fucking tech company to begin with, and they have the scale and reach to do so, but don\u2019t think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them. These other Auto OS (if made) will be specific and unique to that companies own car. Think. Use that smooth brain.\n\nBlackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market.\n\nAlso this is a tough fucking market. Cars are one of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing. This isn\u2019t like a laptop, you click the wrong link, and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups. The car is more serious. You click the wrong link; and you\u2019re dead.\n\nAre you getting the picture now? Do you see why Cylance was bought? Do you see why BlackBerry\u2019s moat is so secure?\n\nCylance has just been integrated into QNX and was shown off at CES. How many of you missed that fine detail?\n\nNot only does QNX now act as the gatekeeper of all auto data, it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows, which it will, exponentially.\n\nAutomakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX.\n\nRemember when Chen said: \u201cwhen better days come, we\u2019ll be ready to execute\u201d\n\nBetter days are here. This is what he was talking about. They\u2019ve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready. The foresight on Papa Chen... Absolute Genius.\u201d\n\nCredits fo the DD: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l37ktg/bb_weekend_due_diligence_confirmation_bias/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

To strategize for this, I decided to do some quick math.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs most of you degenerates know, VW temporarily became the most valuable company in the world in the great squeeze of '08. Well, why can the same not happen to GME? Surely, some will argue about the difference in the underlying financials between the two stocks. But to that, I ask, was VW ever shorted by 140%? Fuck no.\n\nLet's do some quick math.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApple is the worlds most valuable company, at $2.215T.\n\nGME has 69.75M shares outstanding\n\nFor GME to become the world's most valuable company, each share should be worth at least:\n\n$2.215T / 69.75M = **$31,756 per share**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven the historical precedent of major squeezes becoming the world's most valuable company, I will be setting my limit value at **no less than $30,000 per share.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$1000 is not a meme. $5000 is not a meme. $10,000 is not a meme. and even $30,000 is not a meme.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not a financial advisor and I do not recommend you follow some blind retard hoping to change his family's life at the expense of these greedy fucks. All views are my own and again, I am retarded so do not follow my advice, I am simply explaining my own personal strategy.",

        "selftext": "Tesla stock went up almost 700% this year because Wedbush (who\u2019s made an absolute fortune getting people to buy into his narrative) got retail investors to buy into the narrative that Tesla is not an automotive company, despite over 90% of its revenue coming from selling cars. Once the narrative stuck that it\u2019s a \u201ctech\u201d company, BAM, valuation goes up $550B. And please don\u2019t be an autist and say something retarded like \u201cif Tesla is a car company then Apple is a phone company\u201d. Yes, over 50% of apples revenue is from phones, but they also have huge revenue segments in Mac, IPad, Audio, Services, etc. So, if Apples revenue was 90% phones then yes that statement would be true, buts it\u2019s not so please don\u2019t try and justify it with that stupid brainwashing comment (which I know someone will post in the comments and get 1k upvotes). \n\nNow, Tesla is a phenomenal company with a visionary leader, don\u2019t get me wrong - but they are being priced like the next Amazon. One slip up and they will tumble - or if they can\u2019t find that one thing that will essentially print money for them (Apple iPhone, Google ads, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services), then valuation will get cut in half. The first 6x months will be about value stocks, and I predict Tesla hits $500 before it hits $900. I think this year makes millionaires first from Tesla puts, then calls in the second half of the year. \n\nThe only thing I can think of that makes this not happen is the amount of cash they have on hand from selling more shares. That amount of money is dangerous in the hands of Elon. But let\u2019s see what happens - I think puts are the way to go early on, could net some new millionaires.",

        "selftext": " \n\nSo you bought $BB at $11 pre-market friday.

EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn't fucking matter. It \ud83d\ude80 will \ud83d\ude80 be \ud83d\ude80 in \ud83d\ude80 every \ud83d\ude80 single \ud83d\ude80 one \ud83d\ude80 Oh, and Blackberry QNX is fun too.\n\nBefore you start reading, I'd suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.\n\nYou've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.\n\nSo why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*\n\n**Zombie cars and QNX**\n\nQNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.\n\nBlackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally could develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.\n\nFast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?\n\n[SONY?](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGWdfOT_GLnUXiZBQr4m4lDr6V0nzG6pkRMU6WLRNhsLRKDJHY4MAwxHb-HWZr3pDmEfBYyleSgqSAIjoeXMqU6MfKVSgBbWY5t8brOzZ61dAfzBMOQezOwKfHLLecBdHNEqSjqSskM_c-uUKa-IndxUGWi_Ay9pQMD4kj0iDqvI) Blackberry QNX.

If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? [Li Auto](https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974) But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using [Nvidia](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform) DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*\n\nYou might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLinux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.\n\nThat's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in \"Fate of the Furious\" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.\n\nYou know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.\n\nThe best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.\n\nNow that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Blackberry x AWS IVY**\n\nIVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That's right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\n\nSo what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.\n\nIVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.\n\nBut you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.\n\nBest part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.\n\nFor me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory I\u2019m not a financial advisor this is not blah blah blah.\n\nOkay GME gang. We\u2019ve got the shorts on the ropes. They\u2019re bleeding hard and all the billionaire suits are shitting themselves out of fear. They\u2019ve tried false information, getting on CNBC and screaming for regulation of our \u201cmarket manipulation,\u201d trying to get us shut down, Biden administration tweet, saying shorts have already covered, etc. None of it has worked so far and they\u2019re still bleeding money.\n\nNow they\u2019re truly desperate. What\u2019s something they haven\u2019t tried quite yet but very well could be setting up to do?\n\nMARKET CRASH\n\nYes, that\u2019s right. I believe with what I\u2019m currently seeing, they are going to crash the market and blame it on us. Do I think you need to be concerned about GME? No, because holding it should still work and they still have to cover anyway, but this is definitely to try to get you scared and sell GME and so they can take your money back when you reinvest elsewhere.\n\nI don\u2019t think I have to tell many of you that the current levels are at/above where the market was valued in 2008 before the crash according to the Buffet indicator. All this says is that we\u2019re probably in a market bubble, and it\u2019s been at these levels for months now. But guess what just started getting talked about by all the suits? That\u2019s right. A bubble. And who are they blaming? Us.\n\nNow that I have your attention, let\u2019s look at a few other things.\n\n[This is the Volatility Index the past week.](https://imgur.com/gallery/C9ETmMR) Notice how it\u2019s been steadily rising and suddenly spiked today? 40 is typically the resistance before the market makes a downturn. If this thing gets above that we\u2019ll probably be seeing the market dropping quickly.\n\nAdditionally, there the spurts of high volume absolutely dumping stocks for short amounts of time. That\u2019s one of the first things I noticed before the March crash and I\u2019ve been seeing it get more and more abundant the last few weeks and picking up a lot today. [Notice the large red volume candles on the weekly SPY chart.](https://imgur.com/a/w0y33Lq) (Robinhood screenshot on a DD post??? Yes, I know. I\u2019m on my phone with limited time. Deal with it lol.)\n\nNow you might say, \u201cit\u2019s earnings season and there have been some bad earnings so far and that\u2019s expected in this tough time.\u201d Well yes, but there\u2019s the Apple earnings today. They beat earnings pretty nicely and what did the stock do? [You guessed it (I hope).](https://imgur.com/a/Txc7po6)\n\nCurrently we\u2019re seeing fundamentally strong companies as well as the S&amp;P 500 beginning to drop and the volatility increase market wide. You could say this is \u201csmart money\u201d pulling out because they see the overvalued stocks. However, there were many worldwide financial issues sparking before the March crash. It just needed a catalyst, AKA global pandemic. Now we\u2019re in a similar boat. Market issues in need of a catalyst.\n\nWhat is that catalyst this time around? That\u2019s right. A bunch of \u201cmillennials on a message board who have no place in stocks creating a market bubble.\u201d Basically this isn\u2019t smart money pulling out here. It\u2019s MAD MONEY (hi Cramer). They are declaring WAR. They are pissed that we are \u201cstealing\u201d their billions on billions of dollars from them and they will do whatever it takes to get you to sell and take your money away from you again, including wrecking the market and the economy once again. The suits are out for blood now.\n\nDo I think this will effect GME much? Only if you don\u2019t sell. All this is scare tactics and ways to win your money back if keeping GME suppressed fails even more than it already has. There are hardly any shares to short if any at all and retail investors and autists are likely the ones holding most of the shares that could be sold.\n\nBe careful out there autists\n\nTLDR: GME TO VALHALLA. Rest of the market, potentially to the depths of Avernus soon.\n\nPositions, GME Feb 19th $115 calls",

        "selftext": "This story could definitely have wide ranging impacts within the O&amp;G sector - should be interesting to see how it unfolds:\n\n* * *\n\nThe chief executives of Exxon XOM -2.65% Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. CVX -4.29% spoke last year about combining the oil giants, according to people familiar with the talks, testing the waters for what could be one of the largest corporate mergers ever.\n\nChevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth and Exxon CEO Darren Woods spoke shortly after the coronavirus pandemic took hold, decimating oil and gas demand and putting enormous financial strain on both companies, the people said. The discussions were described as preliminary and aren\u2019t ongoing but could come back in the future, the people said.\n\nSuch a deal would reunite the two largest descendants of John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911, and reshape the oil industry.\n\nA combined company\u2019s market value could top $350 billion. Exxon has a market value of $190 billion, while Chevron\u2019s is $164 billion. Together, they would likely form the world\u2019s second largest oil company by market capitalization and production, producing about 7 million barrels of oil and gas a day, based on pre-pandemic levels, second only in both measures to Saudi Aramco.\n\nBut a merger of the two largest American oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. President Biden has said climate change is one of the biggest crises the country faces. In October, he said he would push the country to \u201ctransition away from the oil industry.\u201d He hasn\u2019t been as vocal about antitrust matters, and the administration has yet to nominate the Justice Department\u2019s head of that division.\n\nOne of the people familiar with the talks said the sides may have missed an opportunity to consummate the deal under former President Donald Trump, whose administration was seen as more friendly to the industry.\n\nA handful of sizable oil and gas deals were completed last year, including Chevron\u2019s $5 billion takeover of Noble Energy Inc. and ConocoPhillips \u2019 roughly $10 billion takeover of Concho Resources Inc., but nothing close to the scale of combining San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron and Irving, Texas-based Exxon.\n\nSuch a deal would be noteworthy in the oil industry, surpassing in size the mega-oil-mergers of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which included the combination of Exxon and Mobil and Chevron and Texaco Inc.\n\nIt also could be the largest corporate tie-up ever, depending on its structure. That distinction currently belongs to the roughly $181 billion purchase of German conglomerate Mannesmann AG by Vodafone AirTouch Plc in 2000, according to Dealogic.\n\nMany investors, analysts and energy executives have called for consolidation in the beleaguered oil-and-gas industry, arguing that cutting costs and improving operational efficiencies would help companies weather the pandemic-induced downturn and prepare for an uncertain future as many countries seek to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels to combat climate change.\n\nIn an interview discussing Chevron\u2019s earnings Friday, Mr. Wirth, who like Mr. Woods also serves as his company\u2019s board chairman, said that consolidation could make the industry more efficient. He was speaking generally and not about a possible Exxon-Chevron merger.\n\n\u201cAs for larger scale things, it\u2019s happened before,\u201d Mr. Wirth said, referring to the 1990s and early-2000s megamergers. \u201cTime will tell.\u201d\n\nPaul Sankey, an independent analyst who hypothesized a merger of Chevron and Exxon in October, estimated at the time that the combined company would have a market capitalization of about $300 billion and $100 billion in debt. A merger would allow them to cut a combined $15 billion in administrative expenses and $10 billion in annual capital expenditures, he wrote.\n\nExxon was America\u2019s most valuable company seven years ago, with a market value of more than $400 billion, nearly double Chevron\u2019s. But Exxon has fallen from its heights following a series of strategic missteps, which were further exacerbated by the pandemic. It has been eclipsed as a profit engine by tech giants such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. in recent years and was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year for the first time since it was added as Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1928.\n\nExxon\u2019s shares have fallen nearly 29% over the last year, while Chevron\u2019s are down about 20%. Chevron briefly topped Exxon in market capitalization in the fall.\n\nExxon endured one of its worst financial performances ever in 2020. It is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history on Tuesday and already has posted more than $2 billion in losses through the first three quarters of 2020.\n\nChevron also has struggled, reporting nearly $5.5 billion in 2020 losses Friday. But investors have expressed more faith in Chevron because it entered the downturn with a stronger balance sheet\u2014in part because it failed in its $33 billion bid to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. before the pandemic, having been outbid by Occidental Petroleum Corp. in 2019.\n\nExxon has about $69 billion in debt as of September, while Chevron has around $35 billion, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nSome investors have grown increasingly concerned about Exxon\u2019s direction under Mr. Woods as the company faces a rapidly changing energy industry and growing global consciousness about climate change. Some are also worried that Exxon may have to cut its hefty dividend, which costs it about $15 billion annually, due to its high debt levels. Many individual investors count on the payments as a source of income.\n\nMr. Woods embarked on an ambitious plan in 2018 to spend $230 billion to pump an additional one million barrels of oil and gas a day by 2025. But before the pandemic, production was up only slightly and Exxon\u2019s financial flexibility was diminished. In November, Exxon retreated from the plan and said it would cut billions of dollars from its capital spending every year through 2025 and focus on investing in only the most promising assets.\n\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s woes have helped draw the attention of activist investors. One of them, Engine No. 1 LLC, has argued that the company should focus more on investments in clean energy while cutting costs elsewhere to preserve its dividend. The firm nominated four directors to Exxon\u2019s board Wednesday and called for it to make strategic changes to its business plan.\n\nExxon also has been in talks with another activist, D.E. Shaw Group, and is preparing to announce one or more new board members, additional spending cuts and investments in new technologies to help it reduce its carbon emissions.\n\nRivals such as BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have embarked on bold strategies to remake their business as regulatory and investor pressure to reduce carbon emissions mounts. Both have said they will invest heavily in renewable energy\u2014a strategy that their investors so far haven\u2019t rewarded.\n\nExxon and Chevron haven\u2019t invested substantially in renewables, instead choosing to double down on oil and gas. Both companies have argued that the world will need vast amounts of fossil fuels for decades to come, and that they can capitalize on current underinvestment in oil production.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/exxon-chevron-ceos-discussed-merger-11612126203?mod=hp_lead_pos1",

        "selftext": " Hello,\n\nLet's go straight to the point.\n\nApple announced in 2020 that they plan to increase the level of privacy of the iOS users, with the release of iOS 14. What does that mean concretely?\n\n\\--&gt; As soon as you open a new app, they will ask with a pop up \"Do you allow this app to track you across different apps\". We expect that 10 to 20% of the users will say yes. Bumble officially said while filing their IPOs that could be a major risk for them, to do proper analytics on their users.\n\nTherefore, all the apps relying on paid acquisition, won't be able to track where you are coming from, and if you are a rentable user. Therefore, it makes it even harder to create profitable user acquisition campaigns on mobile. Those who will suffer from it are casino, midcore, casual games, as well as all the apps relying on paid subscriptions. It will provoke a drop of eCPMS (price per 1000 impressions of ads), as there will be less demand on the ad networks.\n\nCertain networks will suffer more than other, but the biggest one is Facebook.\n\n99% of the revenue of Facebook is coming from ads. It means that they will still be able to do targeting on Facebook itself, but not on the networks of apps that run ads (like all the games). Facebook is a key player in this industry, and this will certainly provoke a drop in terms of revenue (9M businesses are relying on their ad network). They officially said that IDFA change (this iOS privacy update) \" Could Have A Material Business Impact\".\n\nApple postponed their measure to Q1 2021, but this will come.\n\nGoogle usually follow suit with these kind of measures.\n\nTLDR : Significant drop in terms of ad revenue on mobile due to the new iOS privacy change. It will prevent targeting and tracking of the users. Facebook will suffer from it like crazy, as well as other ad players such as Unity, Ironsource (IPO soon) or Applovin (IPO soon), and apps Bumble (IPO soon).\n\nPlay : Wait for Q4 Revenue of Facebook. Then short Facebook until next quarter, when the measure will show its impact\n\nThoughts ?",

Apple is expected to have historic earnings in less than 2 weeks and the stock experienced a huge dip today, GME fell hard also and every fucking autist here was buying it. We finished the day at 8 percent up.\n\nI would not judge anyone who sales next week, not everyone needs to be a long term investor, but fuck the paper handed mfos who bought shares today and immediatly sold 1 hour later. How much can you actually lose? The absolute bottom is 4 per share and that would put the company at 2.5 bil valuation. The brand name is worth more than that and BB is a significant player in the IoT, Cybersecurity and EV industries. The cyber firm Crowdstrike has  180 mil revenue compared to BB near 1 billion and is valued at 50 billion, ten times more than BB. If you are gonna paper hand, at least wait till you are an in profit, the retards  who sold GME after the last dip are deeply regretting it now. \n\nPS: Today was tough, but the battle has just began. Report for duty soldiers, let's see how many of us are still holding.",

        "selftext": "I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

The rivals are also clients of JPMorgan\u2019s commercial and investment banking in many cases, he added.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Competition will be particularly tight in the world of payments, he said: \u201cI expect to see very, very tough, brutal competition in the next 10 years,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cI expect to win, so help me God.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dimon added that in some cases, the new players were \u201cexamples of unfair competition\u201d that the bank would do something about eventually. He included players that take advantage of richer debit-card revenue for small banks and firms Dimon accused of not taking precautions against money laundering.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He specifically called out Plaid, the payments start-up whose acquisition by Visa recently collapsed, saying \u201cpeople who improperly use data that\u2019s been given to them, like Plaid.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Plaid CEO Zach Perret declined to directly respond to the accusation during an [interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/15/plaid-ceo-on-how-its-5-point-3-billion-deal-with-visa-fell-through.html) with CNBC\u2019s David Faber, adding that Plaid is spending time with the bank on a partnership.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When contacted for further comment, a Plaid spokeswoman said the company is \u201cfocused on ensuring people have access to their own financial information so they can securely share it with permission in order to use the fintech apps they choose.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She added that \u201cdata privacy and security are core to everything we do, including the data exchange agreements we have with JPMorgan Chase among many other banks.\u201d\n\n[Original CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/jamie-dimon-says-jpmorgan-chase-should-absolutely-be-scared-s-less-about-fintech-threat.html)",

        "selftext": "Obviously if you own an index fund you don't have to make this decision, more power to you. For those preferring a more concentrated portfolio style, I think this is an interesting question - because these are all great companies, but naturally one must be better than the others.\n\nIf you had to pick just one of the mega-caps, which do you buy today?\n\nMy personal thoughts:\n\n- Facebook. I see potential competition to their network, but the balance sheet is a fortress and valuation has been pushed down a bit due to general public hatred. A contrarian pick. (B)\n\n- Apple. In my opinion the valuation of this has run away farther ahead of its earnings relative to the others, making it the least attractive of the bunch for me. (C-)\n\n- Amazon. Doing amazing things, looking at the last several quarters their earnings seem to be accelerating - however the p/e is higher than all the rest. (A-)\n\n- Microsoft. The sleeper choice, solid valuation in addition to growth. Not flashy but a money printer. (A)\n\n- Google. My perception is that they're slipping - taking lots of high risk/high payoff bets that don't appear to be paying off yet. Feels potentially contrarian but I'm not wildly excited. (C)?\n\n- Bonus: Mastercard/Visa. Secular trend away from cash makes these seem like long term great picks, in spite of fin-tech disruptors. Not cheap valuations though. I favor MA over V for efficient use of capital. (B+)\n\nJust my opinions of course. Your thoughts?",

        "selftext": "Yo \n\nIf you think BB moon\u2019d after this week, you\u2019re a rough brained retard. Our astronauts John Chen and Tom Eacobacci are literally in the break room; Chen\u2019s unpacking some homemade Yangzouh Fried Rice from his wife, Tom is microwaving stale coffee and asking Chen if he\u2019s going to change his name to Cha Ching after he becomes a Billionaire in 2023. Chen smirks as he cracks open his wheel of fortune cookie... the  point is, rocket is still fucking grounded. I repeat, the rocket is grounded. \n\nListen retards, did you miss AMD? Did you miss NVDA? Did you miss trash ass Cringecoin? Hell, did you even miss TSLA? Are you seething with FOMO up to your ears and out of your assholes watching these stocks mint fresh millennial millionaires while you twiddled your thumbs thinking \u201cGeE WiZ tHeY haVe To CoMe DoWn EveNtuAlLYyyyYyyYy\u201d \n\nPro tip: they never came down...\n\nThese rockets went to the fucking moon and left your ass behind on planet Earth, living a shitty wage life flipping burgers, while the retards that boarded these rockets are on the moon laying on beach chairs, sunglasses on, and rubbing sunscreen with SPF 9000 on their smooth brains because they got front row tickets to the sun... FRONT ROW TICKETS TO THE FUCKING, SUN... this is the present state of affairs. \n\nThere is, lucky you, however, another rocket with the inscription BBC fueling up and selling tickets to the moon AS WE SPEAK.\n\nCurrent position: missionary with 10,555 shares and reverse cowgirl with some calls. I\u2019m holding unrealized profits of about $110k and realized profits of about $100k. \n\nHowever, if you ask me 10 years from now my biggest regret in life... I will tell you two things: 1, not getting my wife her bf earlier on, and 2, booking $100k profit too soon in BB. \n\nMay Lord Chen forgive my moment of weakness. Learn from me. Buy and walk away. Buy and hold. Do not be tempted to sell before the moon. To not sell when the rocket is still in the stratosphere. \n\nMoon is $50 IF THE STOCK JUST TRADES ON PAR WITH ITS FUCKING PEERS, MOON CAN EASILY BE $100+ IF YOU FACTOR IN VERTICALS, ECONOMIC MOAT, and a $450-750 billion Auto Data Market as stated in Mckinsey &amp; Company\u2019s report on Monetizing Auto Data. Yes that\u2019s not a mistake, the overall revenue pool from Global Auto Data monetization could be as high as $750 BILLION in 2023. This is the market BB has cornered and is about to squeeze by the balls. QNX was always the crown Jewel of all their verticals. This was always the master plan for the turnaround. We are on the fucking cusp of one of the greatest turnarounds in history. \n\nListen, I don\u2019t think some of you rough brained retards realize what is happening: \n\nAsk yourselves: why is the EV sector so hot? Why is every large tech corporation trying to get a piece of this Auto pie? \n\nYou wanna know why? Because when the computer first came out it took the space of entire fucking floors in a building to do simple calculations... when the cell phone first came out, you needed a fucking brief case just to carry it and looked like an absolute tool making a phone call, stopping everything you\u2019re doing, laying down your suitcase, opening it, taking out the brick, extending a massive antenna, LMFAO, what fucking tools boomers were... anyways, now look at the modern laptop and smartphone. Look at the revolutions these products went through to become cemented into our lives. Look at the markets these products opened up for us. \n\nNow, what current item is undergoing this type of revolution? You guessed it, you smooth brained criminal you, the Automobile. What was once dinosaur machinery unironically running on dead dinosaurs, is now making the revolution on the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today. \n\nAnd guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance? Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today, hint hint: it\u2019s the same company that\u2019s so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround: Revenue Growth. \n\nBlackberry. It\u2019s Blackberry. Babe berry. Member berry. The blacker the berry... the sweeter the juice boys. \n\n\u201cwhAt aBoUT GoOgLe aNd APpLe or TSLA TaKiNg OvEr the Auto OS mArKet\u201d \n\nListen retards, BlackBerry\u2019s MOAT is bullet proof. You know why?\n\nBecause what\u2019s the one thing Google, Apple, and TSLA have in common? They\u2019re actually in the fucking auto business. \n\nYou think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost? Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is? \n\nLet me demonstrate with the ol\u2019 lemonade stand analogy. Let\u2019s say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade. Next thing you know, Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand, and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes. You\u2019re fucked. Jimmy just took your business, your friends, and your girl and her bf. \n\nYou need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade... so how will you do this? Are you gonna go up to Jimmy\u2019s stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy? Is that what a smooth brained person would do? \n\nNO, you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store, buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them, and while you\u2019re at it, buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your fucking lemonade. Because fuck Jimmy, that\u2019s why. \n\nSpeaking of lemonade... \n\n\u201cwHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB?\u201d\n\nAndrew Left although the gayest bear of them all, actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA. He was early on that call, but he was right. \n\nBack to the lemonade moat: \n\nListen retards, Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple, Google, and TSLA are. You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS? Or you think these non techy auto dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS. Fuck no. Don\u2019t be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear \u201cDD\u201d \n\nBlackBerry is a third party corporation that all auto makers can form an auto cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord. A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they\u2019re a fucking tech company to begin with, and they have the scale and reach to do so, but don\u2019t think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them. These other Auto OS (if made) will be specific and unique to that companies own car. Think. Use that smooth brain. \n\nBlackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market. \n\nAlso this is a tough fucking market. Cars are on of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing. This isn\u2019t like a laptop, you click the wrong link, and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups. The car is more serious. You click the wrong link; and you\u2019re dead. \n\nAre you getting the picture now? Do you see why Cylance was bought? Do you see why BlackBerry\u2019s moat is so secure? \n\nNot only does QNX act as the gatekeeper of all auto data, it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows, which it will, exponentially. \n\nAutomakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX.\n\nRemember when Chen said: \u201cwhen better days come, we\u2019ll be ready to execute\u201d\n\nBetter days are here. This is what he was talking about. They\u2019ve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready. The foresight on Papa Chen... Absolute Genius.  \n\n[The Ultimate DD by Mckinsey &amp; Company \u2014 Read This and Get your Pee Pee Hard knowing BB will effectively be the gatekeeper of this New Market](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive%20and%20assembly/our%20insights/monetizing%20car%20data/monetizing-car-data.ashx)",

        "selftext": "I think that we can finally say that there is a pretty clear bubble, more or less in different  areas. The market has been acting absolutely wild as everyone can clearly see. People are pumping stocks for fun and that is worrying me a lot. If things go south, how big of a reaction will there be in the entire stock market?\n\nGamestop, Blackberry, AMC, Nokia have been pumped really heavily and seeing 100% gains in a single day for no reason should warn us to be alert at all times. Especially now, when many of us haven\u2019t experienced this ever before in this big of a scale. \n\nWhile I\u2019m really liking how the retail investors are kicking the hedge fund managers\u2019 asses, we all should be prepared for the worst. Once people start to realize their gains and start to sell, we\u2019re in for a wild show. And that moment will come sooner or later. That\u2019s just a fact. People will want money at some point. When that point comes, you should have probably sold and gotten out already.\n\nI don\u2019t like to be bearish, but I\u2019d say that there\u2019s a some kind of a bubble now and it will affect all areas more or less.\n\nFundamentals are literally trash for people. Microsoft and Apple released some staggering all time high results yesterday and only few people seemed to give a damn about it, at least in this sub. I wonder when we\u2019re gonna go to a different direction and pivot towards a more fundamental orientated market. It could take a long time, or it could happen next month.\n\nBecause in the end, the companies with solid fundamentals and consistant long term growth will be the ones that will perform in the long term... \n\n...But this is a different topic which needs to be discussed on a later date.\n\n\n\nThe saddest part of this is that the ones who suffer from this, will be us, retail investors. People will think that Gamestop, AMC &amp; Co will only go up. That is unfortunately, not the case. \n\nAnd I\u2019m fearing that some of us will realize that too late. Some people have bought stocks with debt and this will bite heavily in the ass, when these meme stocks go down hill. And trust me, they go down quicker than up.\n\nPeople\u2019s mental health will be on the line, when they see their brokerage accounts heavily in the cold. This is my biggest worry. How will people react to this when things go south and GME drops from their current levels.\n\nSo all I\u2019m asking is for people to be wise with their money and put in an amount that they\u2019re comfortable losing with. Stocks do go down. GME goes down. And everyone should be ready for it at all times.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "**TLDR:** Due to a confluence of factors (none of which are technical analysis), I believe a perfect storm is likely forming for a monster, historic ER occurring sometime in late January. The initial main factor for this was that COVID issues were causing a delay in the iPhone 12 launch, pushing it into to this quarter, but that led me to discover numerous other factors now making up my thesis. I believe not only will earnings grow, but the multiple could even expand. How to play it: calls dated end of Jan or mid Feb.    \n    \n# Analysis:    \nHappy hangover day, fellow autists. I believe opportunities are rare to know when an ER is going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch, and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big. When I play earnings releases, I\u2019m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta/IV crush surrounding the ER (theta gang always wins). This time however, I\u2019ve bought outright calls. Here is what I\u2019m seeing with Apple: \n    \n## The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons.    \nWhat kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter do to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone. Typically new iPhones are announced in mid-September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month. However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October. The iPhone 12 preorders began mid-October with shipments a week later, and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6. And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept. 30 (Apple\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter)as they usually do. This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1, setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate.  [Here\u2019s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch.](https://fortune.com/2020/10/29/apple-q4-2020-earnings-delayed-iphone-12-sales/)    \n    \n## The \u201csuper cycle\u201d rumors appear to be true.    \nAs a lover of new tech, I always have to remind myself that the average person doesn\u2019t care about incremental new features as much as I do. So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a \u201csuper cycle\u201d of upgrades due to 5G, I was skeptical. How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone? But based on reports starting to come out, those rumors appear to be correct. I\u2019ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6.     \n    \n[Here\u2019s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbush\u2019s analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-apple-aapl-iphone-12-141113883.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACvsQ8XuWl-EktMyc_0BOQkervx-N2812THmBzr26X8EZIBpNv2lmQ5FSlcToQD1EVRPC0q6byIRBL57FjX5kL4yCvJbv0rwaj4D16cz9J0QrnLFX9fVib7fRoDktDyMAWwBKhfTL_JRqy04wsJCzfTUD7Aw9ce6SkM21ZQOqbYO).   \n    \nHere are some notable quotes from that article since I know we don\u2019t read around here.    \n&gt;\"Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds \u2026 **a roughly 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts**,\" says Ives, who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush.    \n    \n&gt;Compare that to the firm's expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time. Three months ago, Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter; it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October; and in mid-December, it set a \"stretch goal\" in the mid-80 million range.    \n    \n&gt;Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company's fiscal 2021, but Wedbush's bull case is \"north of 240 million units (250 million could be in the cards \u2013 an eye popping figure)\" that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015.    \n    \n&gt;**\"We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis.\"**.   \n    \n[Here is an AppleInsider article, although it quotes the same research at Wedbush](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/15/apple-iphone-production-reports-corroborate-supercycle-thesis-analyst-says).   \nNotable quote:    \n&gt; That bump in production would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in smartphone models produced, **and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations**, Ives wrote.    \n    \n    \nIt\u2019s anecdotal, but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max, however I did buy the 12 Pro Max.    \n    \n## The iPhone 12 sales mix:   \nIt\u2019s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch, it\u2019s the mix within those sales. Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium, because the total addressable market is bigger. That doesn\u2019t appear to be the case this time. As early as September people were reporting that [Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry-level handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-iphone-12-sales-mix) anticipating a shift in demand, and they appear to have been correct. Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin. This year almost immediately after launch [people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/greater-than-expected-iphone-12-demand-apple-aapl-stock-buy/) Since then, there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions.   \n    \n## Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas.\nSee further below for one of the reasons this may have happened, in both my \u201cmacro\u201d and \u201crisks\u201d sections.    \n    \n    \n\nApple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year, and they sold out of all of them. **The list of sold-out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max; iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini; MacBook Air and Pro; iMac and iMac Pro; HomePod mini, and AirPods Max.** [Here\u2019s a Barron\u2019s article mentioning the sell outs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-10-best-stocks-for-2021-51608337138).    \n\n    \n    \nApple wearables, I would argue, are now what economists call Veblen goods. These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases. This can happen in goods such as wine, where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality. But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status. One example of this is sports cars. You can buy cars with 90% of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30% of the price, but that\u2019s not the point of owning them, is it? How often are you really out at the track? Lambo isn\u2019t in competition with $50k sports cars. They could raise the price $50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more. Louis Vuitton bags and $50,000 Birkin purses are more examples. In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices, they forbid people from buying them. You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before you\u2019re \u201callowed\u201d to even buy a Birkin bag. This just makes new money women want them even more. \n   \n\nThose are dramatic examples of course and Apple isn\u2019t behaving that way, but Apple just introduced very overpriced, new over-the-ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor, and yet...Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins. Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing, not less, because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers (and the opposite sex).   \n    \n## The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace\nI can\u2019t track down the things I\u2019ve read here and there on Twitter and I\u2019m starting to run out of steam here, so you may have to do some searching on your own, but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Apple\u2019s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace. This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links.    \n    \n## App sales are crushing it.   \nThanks probably in part to quarantine, app sales have been crushing it and [grew ~35% this December compared to ~17%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-alphabet-strong-christmas-sales) the prior year, meaning sales have grown at twice the pace.     \n\n## Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced     \nThe biggest thing I\u2019ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle...aka subscriptions. A company announces its cutting its dividend, but then tells you that\u2019s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions? The stock skyrockets. Look at Disney. AT&amp;T may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner/HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content, but that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d for them.    \n    \nApple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year. I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life. I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud, and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc. I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not.     \n    \nIt is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion.\n    \n# RISKS\n**Are sellouts due to high demand, or due to COVID-related production problems?**    \nI don\u2019t know.  Based on the reports I\u2019ve read, some of which have been linked earlier in my post, it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip. One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadn\u2019t produced enough heading into Christmas. I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year, but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue. I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production, the market wouldn\u2019t really care. Markets are forward looking. They know COVID has impacted things globally, and even if Apple reports sales difficulties **they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2**. [New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20-30% because of strong demand}.(https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/strong-iphone-12-demand/) An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash.     \n    \n    \n\n**Macro factors causing a crash**.    \nA lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash. This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash. A reversion to the mean is imminent. I don\u2019t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that. Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean it\u2019s going to crash. People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years.    \n    \n\nI\u2019m a little bit older than you guys (by probably about 10-15 years) and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot.com boom. A lot of people were saying the same thing then, and while they were ultimately proven right, they were very early. I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings. Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop, but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued, not dangerously overvalued.    \n    \nAs we go into 2021, we face the following conditions: a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late \u201821 will lead us into a v-shaped recovery. [The Krugman argument for this vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/joe-biden-economy.html), and [The Bloomberg argument for this vision](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/get-ready-for-a-supercharged-economy). We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0% interest rates and the continuation of QE. Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash, it\u2019s a recipe for a steady market melt up. Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0% interest rate environment? 0% pushes up the value of all asset classes, and this is especially true of real estate and stonks. Generally speaking, predicting macro economic movements is a losing game, but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I don\u2019t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters. \n    \nA much smaller factor but still a factor, I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out, although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any.\n\n**Bad subscription numbers**    \n\nIf subscriptions to Apple One flopped, this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers. I personally feel Apple isn\u2019t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in, but I don\u2019t know that for sure. \n\n**Sales could have cratered in October**    \n\nSales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch. What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12? That could be bad. I\u2019m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched (see links earlier in this post), but I don\u2019t really know what October sales look like.\n\n**COVID could have tanked all phone sales.**    \n\n[This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23% on Christmas Day.](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-iphones-dominate-christmas-day-activations) Two thoughts I have on that, that number is for all phone activations, not just iPhones. And two, that\u2019s just for Christmas Day itself. There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day. To counter that, [this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/21/best-selling-5g-phone/), even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month. Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward.\n\n##  Technical Analysis   \nI don\u2019t believe in technical analysis. Charts don\u2019t know any of the things I just explained, and are therefore, in my opinion, useless to me. Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future, but I am not that person. \n\n## Fun rumors    \nI\u2019m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays, but if that\u2019s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air. The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car. Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that [Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech.](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/) Whether these things will impact the stock price isn\u2019t really my cup of tea, but if it\u2019s yours those are two things to consider. \n\n## Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump?    \nI\u2019m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a $2.25 trillion company in any meaningful way.  That sort of thing may work on a post-IPO company that hasn\u2019t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float (aka PLTR or numerous other recent \u201cto the moon\u201d meme stocks) with limited float. (That\u2019s not to say those aren\u2019t great companies or great trades. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019).\n\n\n## My positions: \nI\u2019m more conservative than most of WSB.  While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it, I believe risking it all to chase screenshot-worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real, long-term wealth. Thus my positions are probably more conservative than you\u2019d expect.    \n    \nI have 20% of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs. 9/16/2022 APPL $87.50 calls. I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term. Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock. Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares. Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them. I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so that\u2019s going to sit there for the next two years.\n\nBut I also have put an additional 15% of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER. I have Feb 19 $130 calls which were about 10-15% OTM at the time I bought them. They are currently ITM. I also have 1/29 $135s and 1/29 $141s.     \n    \nThis puts 35% of my net worth into Apple.\n\n## How to get rich\nI intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER, and I don\u2019t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there. I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.    \n    \nI intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV, both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term. I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now, because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50% in the next month. Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect.\n\n## Criticism    \nIf you think I\u2019m wrong, I would strongly encourage you to comment. I don\u2019t give a fuck about looking correct or saving face but I give many fucks about not losing money. If I\u2019m wrong, I want to know it. \n\n## The Most Important Factor    \n\nThis ain\u2019t my first day around here, and I know that DD is absolutely useless without rocketships, therefore: APPLE TO THE \ud83c\udf19  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.     \n\n\n\nGodspeed, fellow autists.",

        "selftext": " (Discretion: First post here. Go easy on me fellow WSB. I also put a lot of \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 here but pleaseeee do your own DD if you're gonna buy $BB)\n\n**Intro:**\n\nMost people look at Blackberry (formerly known as RIM) as a dead cellphone company. A company that\u2019s basically a prehistoric dinosaur at this point with a small cybersecurity portfolio left of their business. Their inability to adapt against cell phone companies such as Apple &amp; Android vendors has caused their main revenue driver to plummet into non-existence. However, their business has been able to keep afloat in the past few years due to their competitive advantages around cybersecurity. Many government officials &amp; corporations till this day still use QNX from BB as their mobile/security platform due to these advantages.\n\n**Word on the street:**\n\nAround last year summer, word on the street was that BB is looking to partner with Amazon on a EV platform around data sensors, automation, and cybersecurity. Stock prices at the time was around $4-6 CAD. Just looking at financials alone and the amount of $ revenue they bring in compared to the industry standards, $BB stock price seemed quite undervalued in comparison. However, this made sense since $BB has failed to deliver and disappointed shareholders over the past years.\n\nWhether we\u2019d like to believe it or not -- EV (electric vehicle) is the future in the next 5 years. Whether that is one day where we run out of fossil fuel\u2026 or people moving towards environmentally friendly options, there is much to be explored and the market is relatively immature.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, every automotive company is chasing EV currently and wants to avoid becoming the next \u201cBlockbuster\u201d prehistoric company. The question we need to ask next is, \u201cDo they have the necessary tools &amp; solutions to help them transition in that journey?\u201d To answer this, I will give a quick example. Most farmers do not build a tractor to farm their crops. They instead go out and buy one than to waste precious time seeing their crops die. I believe this holds true for automotives as they lack the necessary skill sets to develop a platform that can run cybersecurity, data sensors, and automation for their cars. If you didn\u2019t know already, popular car services such as Apple\u2019s CarPlay and Google\u2019s Android Auto all already operate on top of QNX today in our cars today. Amazon\u2019s partnership will only help accelerate that movement as QNX will be linked to their public cloud to do over-the-air monitoring, upgrade, security, collision crashing assistance, autonomous driving, AI machine learning, and many many more.\n\n**What\u2019s happened recently**:\n\nWell\u2026 their partnership with Amazon came true around December. In addition to this, they\u2019ve sold off their \ud83d\udca9 cell phone patents to Huawei so they can finally focus purely on Cybersecurity and EV.\n\nIcing to the cake, they\u2019ve recently won a settlement against Facebook so they gotta pay up that $$$ to $BB which hasn\u2019t been reflected in their quarterly report yet. \n\nSpaceX, Zoom, Qualcomm, governments, and many more are working with $BB as we speak today. Sony recently just announced their partnership with $BB for their next upcoming car last week. Overall, lots of exciting news back to back.\n\nThis explains the excitement around $BB and why it\u2019s been taking off recently. I believe they will continue to do so as the EV and Cybersecurity market continues to evolve from its infancy. (With other digital \"currencies\" growing, would there be a bigger cybersecurity play for $BB? Who knows)\n\n**So.. what are the Risks:**\n\n3 things I can think of currently:\n\n1. No Revenue Growth despite all of the above\n2. EV doesn\u2019t take off as much as it should. COVID is impacting sales of cars or sales of anything in general. Self-explanatory there\n3. Someone creates a better platform over $BB\n\nThis all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.\n\n**TLDR; In Conclusion**\n\nMost boomers will avoid $BB because they think it\u2019s a cellphone company. Anyone that\u2019s googled it recently will know that this isn\u2019t true. I personally think $BB is very undervalued and with the reasons I\u2019ve explained above, I feel there\u2019s much potential for the company to grow. Lots of people are going to be selling it when there\u2019s a bit of a profit but I think the company\u2019s barely scratched it\u2019s potential.\n\nFinally, the ret\u2026.s WSB from reddit are using lingos such as \u201cto the moon\u201d and \u201cRockets \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\u201d for $BB so we all know people are dumping hard on this to make it the next big thing. \n\nLet\u2019s head to Mars bro\ud83d\udcc8 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nYours truly,\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d\ud83d\udc7d \ud83d\udef8",

Probably think its all in goog, aapl, and fb. \n\nIt's not retail investors fault that they took on infinite risk and things didn't go their way. But retail may be able to burn the shorts and not the pensions managed by them all at the same time.\n\nPoke holes in my theory, brain is smooth like a bowling ball, small computations only.\n\nEdit: to those calling me a bot, or saying im doing HF's bidding. This isn't a sob story narrative, no one should feel bad about pensions as collateral damage except the Hf's who took on infinite risk. The only interest in who's assets under management they have is to tell them their investment with HF might blow up and maybe they take their capital out, choking HF's solvency out. \n\nTldr: could wsb retain a securities lawyer (s) to help HF investors / e.g. pension managers understand the true risks of their GME, AMC etc short positions. Possibly rug pulling short sellers capital for a checkmate. Excluding any lock up periods",

You immediately sell the 3 oranges at $40 a piece to buy a shiny apple at $120. You do this because you think the apple is worth more and will appreciate more, but, you turn into a greedy asshole. You then go on TV and tell everyone that oranges are cancerous to scare people into getting rid of their oranges and bring the price down to $20 so that you only have to pay the reddit retard half of what you sold the oranges for. \n\nThis works for a while. More greedy rich assholes follow your lead and sell to each other to the point where 40 retards sell their 40 oranges to these assholes, who sell to each other, making the total number of oranges outstanding 70.\n\nThis is ok, as long as the orange is worth less than the apple. You sold 3 oranges at $40 and bought a shiny apple and now the apple is worth 130 and the oranges are worth $20, so you made more than the $10 that increased in the value of the apple (130-20*3=70). \n\nHowever, something bad happens - Reddit retards notice not enough oranges exists to cover what you and your friends owe, so they decide to buy up all the oranges to raise the price of oranges. Unfortunately for you, this works. And now, oranges are worth 325... So what is your account worth? Negative.\n\nHow? You still owe 3 oranges, just they're now worth $195, and all you have is 1 shiny apple worth $130 to show for it. Your net position on this trade is now worth ($130-$585 = -$455)... Did I forget, that you are also paying 28% interest on the $455, only increasing the amount you owe day after day? You sweat, you panic, you tell your friend at CNBC to tell everyone everything is ok and that you closed your position when you know - you literally can't as you cry and shit yourself and avoid being seen in public as much as you can and keep ignoring you prime brokers phone calls asking for more margin, hoping Robinhood will save you, but they don't, and those oranges are now worth $320 each...\n\nbtw, not a financial advisor so you do you, booboo\n\n#TLDR: HOLD AND BLEED SHORTY#",

        "selftext": "This is long, if you\u2019re uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR\n\nA while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my gambling.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.\n\nI'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.\n\n**Tools**\nI use barchart.  You can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.\n\nThere are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.\n\n**Basic Concept**\nLong story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if \"they\" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.\n\nMM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and shit.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.\n\n**Hunting the Whale**\nSo I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why earlier), then I'm ready to eye scan.\n\nI typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonk that does NOT have earnings imminents.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.\n\n**1) Clusters of orders\u2014ABNB example**\nThe way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of call seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  \n\n**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it\u2019s hedging against itself as it\u2019s own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since it's a smaller volume.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger bet in their stocks, the those type of option clusters indicate the option order is the big play, and it's hedging itself.\n\n**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check their general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter with their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.\n\n**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.\n\n[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)\n\nSo, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all those options showing up at 12:52, that's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute, with some put orders at the bottom.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge--we're onto something.\n\n**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after that one.\n\nPassed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.\n\n**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**\n\nThe same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven\u2019t had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend\u2014this makes the order unusual and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)\n\n[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)\n\nA better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and a one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That\u2019s a flag for us\u2014sporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD Otm calls sprinkle in, ARK invests \n\n**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**\n\nSeeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)\n\nSometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.\n\n\n**How I\u2019ve Fucked Up 1: Don\u2019t get tricked by trends**\n\nAlthough we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just dick-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  When you see shit like this think before you get excited:\n\n[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)\n\nIt was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.\n\n**How I\u2019ve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM\u2019s some breathing room**\n\n*Even if you\u2019re confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two out, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford it just skip that play and check back for something new later, I promise better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.\n\nBreathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.\n\n**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker order that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.\n\n**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH):**\n**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales\n**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping\n**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whales bets on is a 'sell the news' event\n**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out\n**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs\n**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD\n**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, they can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they aren't bagholding until it's in the money\n**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.\n**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.\n**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.\n**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.\n\n**Positions**:\nDumped a ton of stuff and loading up Tuesday because long weekends scare me, but saw some ineresting 2/5s I held including\n\nWKHSc\nPLTRc\nSPYc (1/19, 1/22)\nLMNDp\n\nAnd a couple tickers that I couldn\u2019t post lol.  also have AAPL and JD leaps\n\n***\n\nTLDR\nUse a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.\n\n***\n\n*I might do a pretty consistent DD post (a couple times a week) on what I\u2019m seeing at the end of each day if there is interest, and if it\u2019s not a day I don\u2019t have a ton of real work.  If something quick catches my eye I usually throw it up on my twitter @yourboymilt.  I\u2019ll also probably throw some more potential Monday positions on here over the weekend once I decide to do some more research.  Later.*",

        "selftext": "**Hardware:**\n\nI think the smartest defensive move Facebook can make at this stage is doing whatever it takes to become a major player in consumer hardware. Even if they breakeven, or lose money on this endeavor it can be treated as user acquisition costs for the people who wouldn't make a Facebook account otherwise, or as a way to make Facebook accounts as sticky as possible to protect against people leaving the platform. Anecdotally, I've seen **people that have preached \"Facebook is evil\" for years, say that not they will not ever delete their newly open accounts** because if they did their Oculus hardware wouldn't work, and they'd lose all of their purchases.\n\nFacebook is dominating the growing VR market with an iron fist. **Non-advertising revenue grew 156%** in Q4, and IDC estimates 3 million [Quest 2's were sold in Q4](https://twitter.com/somospostpc/status/1354879840097337349). Oculus Quest 2 has stellar reviews, despite the mandatory Facebook account for use. Facebook's VR devices also use Messenger for messages, Workplace for enterprise, and I believe [Facebook Horizon](https://www.oculus.com/facebook-horizon/) (which is integrated with the FB app) will eventually be the place users load into initially, and launch third party apps from.\n\nHigh investment cost makes it unlikely that other social media company can compete with Facebook in hardware (especially AR/VR), and this should give Facebook a permanent utility advantage against its peers. The companies that could compete, big tech, and gaming giants seem unwilling to make the investment to compete. I think they're aware that Facebook is completely fine making $0 to be dominant in the VR space, and that's scared them away in addition to facts like VR being a relatively small market for them.[Apple is rumored to be considering a release of a Quest-like headset in later 2022, but the device will be priced far above $1000 according to Mark Gurman.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses)\n\nVR is where I'm most confident in Facebook's ability to achieve its hardware dreams, but consumer AR is also an area where its only competition in terms of investments made is Apple. So I think their chances there are decent too. Facebook is working on long term AR glasses, but is also releasing Smartglasses in collaboration with Luxottica (Ray-Ban and Oakley) this year. There's also Facebook's line of smart video chatting devices, Portal.\n\n**Traditionally Listed Moats**\n\nIntangible assets consisting of the vast amount of data users have shared: **sustained and growing**, but people are also sharing things about themselves on other apps increasingly.\n\nGrowth of users means **network effects still growing**\n\nNumber and diversity of advertisers, and advertiser verticals **still growing**\n\n**Competition?**\n\nThere is rising social media competition, and always the threat of new entrants. That being said, competition seems to carve out niches, so they aren't competing as directly as we'd think. The closest thing to Facebook the Blue app, for connecting with family and friends is Instagram. Competing apps can have similar features, but the main utilities are different. Tik Tok is mostly a short video app, Youtube is a long video app, Twitter is a breaking news app, Reddit is a communities app, etc. **Facebook's utility first and foremost is connecting with REAL people who's identity you can verify, like friends and family. Like previously mentioned, the closest competitor is Instagram.**\n\n**Messaging**\n\nThere can be lack of differentiation here, but **Messenger tied to Facebook, Instagram, Portal and Oculus.** I suspect it'll be tied to future hardware as well. Whatsapp has network effects, and may one day have lock-in comparable to Chinese super apps (at least that's what's being worked towards). iMessage is the the main competitor here, because they are automatically installed on every iPhone\n\n**Misc**\n\nI think Facebook Marketplace, the Craigslist alternative **benefits greatly from Facebook using real identities**, and is an overall better product. If you want to sell something locally FB Marketplace is the best option, and I think it's a strong reason to have an account. Usage of Marketplace is growing.\n\nThe integration with Jio in India, and importance in Indian society is worth mentioning for Whatsapp.\n\nFacebook Groups, have competition in the form of Reddit, and Discord. The edge here will be real identities, and the tools they are building to make moderating a Facebook group profitable (subscriptions, etc)\n\nThe only other pure \"Real Identity social network\" is Linkedin is a professional network.\n\n**Problems**\n\n**No young people use Facebook?** This seems to be a US centric cliche, as Facebook is popular among all age demographics around the world. [According to Pew Research 76% of people 18-24 use Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/), only superseded by Youtube. For teens in 2018, [51% of teens used Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/) which is good in my opinion for a social network not targeted to teens like Tik Tok. I personally think the utility of Facebook kicks in after college age, **but regardless if there is a problem, I think the cure can be User Acquisition through hardware.**\n\n**Chance of mass exodus?** again, **mitigated by the lock-in of hardware**, but this is a concern of mine based on Facebook's reputation. **1. Privacy**, there is truth to some criticism here, because Facebook's business model does depend on data collection, and in many ways is opposed to strict definitions of privacy, but much of it is also pushed by myth like \"Facebook sells data\". **Facebook has the same business model as its advertising funded peers, but perception is what matters,** and Facebook is losing the perception battle. **2. Politics,** In my opinion has been half of Facebook's reputation problem. Recently Zuck said that **they are trying to make Facebook less political by not recommending political groups, and lowering reach on political posts**. Also, Donald Trump being gone should make the next 4 years less politically controversial. Since Facebook is in the business of advertising, and people can mostly say what they want, **there's always the small chance of a #DeleteFacebook movement reaching critical mass based on these themes.**\n\n**Being banned in countries?** Mitigated **by becoming a hardware player,** but this is an unlikely outcome for many reasons that my hands are too tired to elaborate on.\n\n**Apple's privacy stance and iOS 14:** The hit to revenue estimates I've seen are between 1%-7%, but it could also be a boost to revenue **since third party signals being reduced will give the edge to whoever has the best first party signals**, we'll have wait to see. This is something to watch closely, but transferring third party data into first party data by having ecommerce on the platform through initiatives like **Facebooks shops, and Instagram shopping can be the cure**. Also, **being in control of hardware mitigates this risk**\n\n**Antitrust-** generally **not concerned**\n\n**Privacy as a theme that is adversarial to advertising -** slightly concerned but **I don't think ad funded business models are going anywhere**, many people like not paying for things\n\n**Might add more to this later...**",

        "selftext": " \n\nTo everyone that held, you\u2019ve leveled to diamond-hand generals. In game theory, the only way you could have maximized your gains was if you all stuck together, and you did! They had counted on you guys scattering, and that\u2019s why they took out new shorts on GME.\n\nGME was on the cusp of a short squeeze on Wednesday, before they closed off all buying, and did the short ladder attack.\n\nIt shows that they\u2019ve learned nothing since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). They play by one primary rule: Heads we win. Tails you lose. And they can change the other rules last minute to drive to the primary rule.\n\nNext, they will try to block/limit buying across RH and more brokerages so there\u2019s not enough volume to drive to the short squeeze. Meanwhile Hedge Funds are free to buy/sell unlimited amount of shares and create short ladder attacks \\[1\\]. Different rules for different players in this game!\n\nBut let\u2019s move back to the whiteboard.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*\n\nToday, I\u2019ll describe what a margin call is and explain a High Short Interestt trading strategy around it. In Particular, I\u2019ll use Melvin Capital presumed short book as a case study.\n\nNote: I\u2019m not a financial advisor, this is just me whiteboarding.\n\nLong/Short Strategy\n\nIn the Hedge Fund industry they have a strategy called long/short. They go long on momentum stocks and short undesirable ones.\n\nIe buying Apple and shorting Gamespot.\n\nThis trade is profitable if Apple\u2019s stock price rises and Gamespot\u2019s (GME) share price decline.\n\nHowever, let say the trade doesn\u2019t go their way and Gamespot share prices dramatically because of a short squeeze. In this case their net position is negative. Let\u2019s say 30% negative. If it becomes large, their brokers calls them up and ask them to put more cash. Then they raise 30% more cash or sell stocks that been paid off to meet the reserve requirement. This is why you see the general stock market deep red, while GME moons. Hedge funds are selling their winning longs to raise cash for the margin requirement.\n\nWhen GME short squeezes, they may have to liquidate (sell off all their longs) and cover their existing short position. Moreover, they have other leverage short positions that are also highly shorted (&gt; 50% of the float). This becomes what\u2019s known as an arbitrage trade. I\u2019ll call it the High Short Interest (HSI) Trade. It\u2019s a high risk trade but with potential for very high profits/returns should it go your way.\n\nThe High Short Interest Trade\n\nShould Hedge funds start to cover short positions because of a margin call or liquidate, they will be forced to buy up shares in the open market. However, if those shares are scares, it will create a huge short squeeze in which they will have to pay higher prices to meet their obligation to return shares.\n\nI\u2019ll use Melvin Capital as a case study because they have publicly declared they had a high short interest in GME, so most likely be margin called or liquidiated, should the GME short squeeze happen.\n\nFurthermore, I\u2019ll analyze their possible short position to justify why the squeeze may happen. Again, this is all conjecture and thinking out a possible trading strategy\n\nIn this case study, a high short interest stock is defined as one in which the short interest is greater than 50%. The reason why we will focus on these stock is because of the difficult of buy back all the shares before the market discovers how these shares are valuable because you have to buy them back at any price to meet contractual obligations.\n\nGoing forward, everything I write is based on conjecture but backed up by evidence. Shorting is a opaque dark art and it\u2019s hard to get concrete data. But it shouldn\u2019t block us in this whiteboarding session.\n\nHere is a Melvin Capital possible short interest based on their sec filing of put positions \\[2\\]\n\n1. Gamespot (GME)\n2. AMC Networks (AMC)\n3. Dillards (DDS)\n4. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)\n5. The Macerich Company (MAC)\n6. Tanger Factory Outlet Center (SKT)\n\nI\u2019ll analyze short interest based on data from ortex.com \\[3\\]. This data is not confirmed but estimate and such has a possibility for high errors. However, ortex has been very reliable in the past.\n\nAMC\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV](https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 63M\n\nFloat: 102M\n\n% of float shorted 62%\n\nDillards (DDS)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB](https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 4.2M\n\nFloat: 5.5M\n\n% of float shorted: 76%\n\nBed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL](https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 58M\n\nFloat: 109M\n\n% of float shorted: 54%\n\nMAC\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP](https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 71M\n\nFloat: 113M\n\n% of float shorted: 63%\n\nSKT\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE](https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE)\n\nEstimate Short Interest: 48M\n\nFloat: 90M\n\n% of float shorted: 53%\n\nAs you can see all these positions are heavily shorted, and should this hedge fund need to acquire shares of them on the market because of liquidation, it may have trouble to close out its short position. Hence, a very high likelihood of a short squeeze.\n\nShort Ladder Attack\n\nA common maneuver Hedge fund deploy to vacuum up shares is a short ladder attack \\[1\\]. They do this to drop the price and scoop up shares. For hedge funds with big short positions this is effective because it makes it seem like the shares aren\u2019t valuable when they are.\n\nUsually, they will borrow 1-3% of shares and short, causing people to panic sell. If they do this repeatedly after like 10 days, they can close out 30% of their short position before the market notices. Do you see now how they can leverage 1% to scoop up 30% of the shares with this attack? It\u2019d be difficult for them to vacuum up all the shares at once without the price increasing or the market knowing, so they manipulate the price lower and do it over a period of time.\n\nThat is why you\u2019ll see the days to cover metric. Based on the volume, it suggest how many days they can get away with this before they are whole. However, should people realize that their short interest is too high, they can HOLD and buy more to force hedge funds to buy the shares at a higher price.\n\nBut you can see that the volume is increasing, so the market is aware of a potential short squeeze.\n\nShort Squeeze Precedent\n\nIn the week of March 20, 2020, Blue Apron had a short interest of about 50%. And then they experienced a short squeeze which led the price to climb 1000% in a week. So you can see how explosive the share price can climb, should a short squeeze occur, for stocks with a short interest of 50% or greater.\n\nNever trade more than you\u2019re willing to lose. Diamond hands.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what\\_is\\_a\\_short\\_ladder\\_attack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what_is_a_short_ladder_attack/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F\\_X01/infotable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://ortex.com](http://ortex.com/)",

If not, GTFO.\n\nWhat I\u2019m here to tell is to not focus 100% on these four and let other great opportunities pass you by. (Note \u2013 What I am NOT TELLING YOU is to sell your GME. Hodor that sh\\*t). While you all have been foaming at he mouth over your GME games, you\u2019ve likely missed what is going on with the rest of the market. Several great performing stocks have been dumping since this GME craze began. Oh, need examples?  To name a few you may have heard of: \n\nAAPL \u2013 Down 5.11% \n\nAMD \u2013 Down 7.7% \n\nBIDU \u2013 Down 7%\n\nDOCU \u2013 Down 8.7%\n\nF \u2013 Down 8.6%\n\nPINS \u2013 Down 6.25%\n\nNIO - down 8%\n\nWondering why this may be? Two theories They both might be right, or I might have a really smooth brain. \n\n1) These hedge funds everyone here is so keen on financially ruining need to cover their losses somehow. What better way than to liquidate stocks that have had crazy runs the last few months.  If this is true it will be extra enjoyable to watch them pay more to re-enter these positions when the stocks inevitably bounce back.\n\n2) You people selling your shares in other stuff to buy more GME. (again, great job holding the line) I have seen several posts on here from other smooth brains selling their shares of some of those listed here. I applaud your enthusiasm for the cause and wish you the best. \n\nWith these two combined, you end up with tons of shares dumping from these 401K stocks, with the buyers foaming at the mouth for more GME, NOK, AMC, BB. \n\nOnce this is all over and the world of normies forget all about the GME madness, they are going to put their money back into their boomer stocks and standard 401K stocks. What does this mean for you? Don\u2019t miss the dips happening all around you while the world is focused on 4 stocks and a shiba inu. If you have any extra money and cant afford GME, check out the rest of the market for buying opportunities. \n\nTLDR \u2013 Keep holding the line! If you have any money left, buy the dips on others for bonus tendies\n\n(This is not financial advice)\n\nEdit - added NIO.",

        "selftext": "**Should you buy Amazon stock or has it run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Amazon? Read until the end of the post as I reveal my price target for Amazon and why I believe it can deliver insane returns!**\n\n**\\~Very Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and welcome to another stock price prediction! Today we are going to talk about Amazon and what\u2019s the upside for the company! So, let\u2019s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years &amp; months.\n\nSo, let\u2019s start by talking a little about [Amazon](https://ibb.co/47vPnY2), yeah, I know it\u2019s one of the biggest companies in the world, but I believe Amazon is still undervalued &amp; underappreciated compared to some of the highflyers that have generate insane returns in the past months, though most of them are still far from profitability and don\u2019t have the growth across all the board like Amazon.\n\nMaybe the market doesn't put as much attention in the numbers as I do but I would rather invest in a business which I consider to be healthy and growing rather than a what if stock like many of the recent inflated IPOs. Amazon is a trillion-dollar company growing at a double-digit pace as many companies that are a fraction of their size would kill for this numbers, but this hasn\u2019t helped Amazon since September.\n\nOn a global scale e-commerce is expected to increase from 16% to 22% of retail sales by 2023. With the U.S. expected to increase its retail e-commerce sales from $374 billion to $476 billion by 2024.This is another thing that supports the growth that e-commerce has in front of it, both as total and as a % of the total retail sales. With the latest [report](https://ibb.co/jRMvB7x) showing a 24% increase in holiday e-commerce transactions and a 19% increase for the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nE-commerce is showing signs that it will continue to gain share of the total market as a recent report projects that digital sales during the Black Friday-to-Cyber Monday period will grow by about 35% YOY, reaching [penetration](https://ibb.co/3StWbwz) of around 32% and growing by more 10B, as this continues to eat up market share from more traditional B&amp;M retailers.\n\nI think one of the biggest problems the company has, it\u2019s the actual share price of the company, not the value. We have seen that a stock split can and will attract more buyers and the share price would probably see an accelerated rate of growth, just look at what happened with Tesla and Apple [recently](https://ibb.co/GFqGsjV). By splitting the stock just like [Apple](https://ibb.co/d766wL5) has done a number of times, this allows more individual investors to invest in the company, as they will be attracted by the cheaper share price. [Amazon](https://ibb.co/XStd5Jf) hasn\u2019t done a share split since the dot com era, and it might be time for the company to take advantage of this hot bull market to actually go ahead with something like at least a 5-10:1 split.\n\nSo, let\u2019s go a little through the latest quarter [results](https://ibb.co/Y8JHWdc) and [guidance](https://ibb.co/mCT3T43). The company increased the operating cash flow by more than 55% to over $55B for the latest twelve months, with free cash flow also increasing by $6B, while they managed to avoid significant [dilution](https://ibb.co/6bYCLhx) of the company, with only 7M additional shares being outstanding.\n\nThe net sales also increased 37% in the last quarter to just over $96B, an increase of more than $26B over 2019, which is an insane 36% increase y/y yet again.\n\nThis year Amazon has also pushed their [Prime Day](https://ibb.co/1RPqhMv) ahead of schedule, which resulted in the two biggest days ever for third-party small &amp; medium sellers, which saw an increase in sales of over 60% over 2019, even bigger than Amazon own retail business.\n\nAmazon continues to expand into multiple revenue streams, with the first Amazon [Fresh](https://ibb.co/9ZBqwKM) grocery store opened in California, which is offering both in-store and online products.\n\nWe also saw Amazon\u2019s more profitable revenue streams meaning the services revenues increasing, with Amazon Studios continuing to produce original movies and TV-series while also expanding their offering to live sport games.\n\nThe company is also seeking to expand into the red-hot Video Gaming market, as they launched a new service Prime Gaming, available for free for Prime Members and also announced Luna which will be a cloud gaming service that will allow customers to play high-quality games on previously owned devices, thus not requiring bigger investments for many customers. They also continued to improve their [devices](https://ibb.co/VVkyDXX) like the Echo, Alexa, Ring and FireTV line of products, which feature more &amp; more AI Improvements.\n\nAmazon has also announced an expansion into the pharmacy business which put a lot of pressure on traditional pharmacy companies like CVS &amp; Walgreens, while also announcing a new Halo service, aimed at helping customers improve their lifestyle.\n\nI like companies that make me a lot of money, but I also like that they are [involved](https://ibb.co/r7C6NXs) in projects aimed at helping poorer communities around the world, with their latest Project Kuiper, being a low-earth orbit satellite constellation that is aiming to provide reliable &amp; cheap internet access around the world.\n\nAnd last but not least, let\u2019s not forget about the biggest income provider as margin goes, the Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://ibb.co/MkHgG7d)). Amazon continued to see significant customer demand for this product with multiple big companies like Global Payments &amp; Moderna using their services. Alongside these 2 companies we also saw AWS providing even more data services for the [NFL](https://ibb.co/zbYySCp) and many more other companies. AWS has been a terrific revenue stream for Amazon, with [AWS](https://ibb.co/87614m9) having 1/3 of the market share for cloud infrastructure in the first half of 2020, as the compound annual growth of AWS has been 40% in the recent years, just below the other profitable [services](https://ibb.co/0Byn2R7) they offer on subscriptions services, advertising &amp; payments, with the only revenue stream seeing a negative growth being the physical stores.\n\nOverall, the company has seen a 28% compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/mCwDCTb) in revenues since 2016 and an even bigger 68% [growth](https://ibb.co/jk57Qq9) in earnings/share, which is incredible to say the least.\n\nSo, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Amazon but I am willing to hear other opinions so don\u2019t be afraid to leave a comment down below!\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s start with the Guidance that Amazon gave us for the 4th quarter, as they are expecting net sales between $112B and $121B implying a growth of between 28-38% over 2019. They also provided guidance for the operating income but this is heavily impacted by the problems we had in 2020 and that still continue to be around.\n\nThe company also is aiming to [optimize](https://ibb.co/0ZTfncc) the free cash flow which was up 26% y/y for Q3, as they are trying to dilute the shares as little as possible. The total net [SALES](https://ibb.co/7jsRCN5) for the last twelve months is nearing $348B which even adjusted for forex is still up 31%. Amazon has only 12% of their revenues coming the AWS right now, but this is by far the most profitable revenue for the company, as the increases in AWS sales have led to an over 90% [increase](https://ibb.co/ts6VKrb) in operating income from the previous year.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the last quarter\u2019s results. We saw a big [INCREASE](https://ibb.co/qrpk3wR) in all 3 big revenue streams for Amazon, with the first 9 months of 2020 brining over $160B in sales in North America, $67B from International sales and almost $33B from AWS. For my [projections](https://ibb.co/4FCPJ8N) I actually just added another quarter like this one to the end results, which actually is a conservative estimate of $96B compared to the guidance of $112B, and the growth rate that Amazon\u2019s net sales has seen in the past year, with North America Sales rising by 37%, International by 31% and AWS by 30%.\n\nFor the cost of sales, I did pretty much the same, and with cost [margin](https://ibb.co/wcP1Wrj) standing at 75% of net sales for the last quarters I think this is pretty safe to say it will remain mostly the same if not even improve due to bigger revenues from the AWS. I also estimated the full yearly costs by adding another identical quarter, just like for the revenues, so that things stay even.\n\nFor the other operating expenses, I also took this from their financials as I expect both [SG&amp;A](https://ibb.co/QN7YWxQ) and [R&amp;D](https://ibb.co/DwmXmsK) expenses to start to normalize a little after the huge spending to ramp up capacity this year due to the increase in demand, while I also did the same thing for the [Capex](https://ibb.co/f0dSK7B) spending of Amazon, as they have invested massively in the last 12 months to ramp up things.\n\nMeanwhile for the interest [income](https://ibb.co/rdc1HRZ) and expenses I also just averaged things out for the full year while maintaining the other sources of income, but these have such a small impact that they don\u2019t even matter.\n\nAmazon has had a pretty wild effective [TAX RATE](https://ibb.co/N3vtKJn) in the past decade, but I decided to see what the avg was for the last 4years, and that was 16%, but for safety and due to the change in administration in the US I decided to bump this up a little to 18%.\n\nAnd one last number that is important is [THE](https://ibb.co/SnQGLXT) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which has seen a 36% increase y/y for since 2016.\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [PROJECTIONS](https://ibb.co/89jHggN), though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.\n\nI used the trailing Twelve-month EBITA (which means Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation &amp; Amortization) and assumed a growth starting from of 15% in 2021 and slightly lower each year ending with a 10% growth for EBITA in 2025. EBIT is calculate after subtracting the depreciation and amortization costs from the EBITA for which I implied an annual increase of 10% so it keeps the pace with the EBITA. I used my projection of the effective tax rate of the company of 18%, which is 2% above the last 4 years avg. NWC is the net working capital of the company and it can be summed up in 2 ways, the simpler method is current assets \u2013 current liabilities or you can use the more complex formula which I have used which is made up of the total amount of cash &amp; cash equivalents, market investments, trade accounts receivable and inventory from which you subtract the trade accounts payable, so this is the formula I used for this DCF. I also implied the same 10% growth for this, as the company will become even more solvent overtime I estimate. And last but not least I implied a 10% growth for Capital Expenditure as well, which seems pretty reasonable despite this level being very high due to the rapid growth of the company.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for this company I think the growth approach is better suited as you will see with my other method, which will show close results to growth approach.\n\nSo, this means we have an estimated $584B worth of FCF for a 10% discount rate, which I believe can be even lower for Amazon, but just to be conservative let\u2019s use this 10% rate for the next 5 years. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Amazon will be worth over $3T by 2025, which is mind blowing. So, let\u2019s do the math, with an estimated diluted share count of 531M, that would mean a stock price of $5732 and would imply a return of 83% by 2025. This are insanely huge numbers so let\u2019s take a look at the EBITDA approach also. The nominal value for the EBITDA multiple is usually 25, so, with this multiple, the company would only be worth $3200, that would be only a 2.6% gain from where it is now. If you do want to be conservative you can also do an average of this and the average price would be $4470, with an average return of 43%, which would be pretty much in line with the annual SP500 growth. You can also check and do your own multiple valuation of the company, for example with Amazon right now has been trading at very high EBITDA multiple until recently, so if you use a 50x [multiple](https://ibb.co/VWDxGcg), the actual projections of the stock would be very close, with 71% return for the EBITDA approach and a 77% upside on average, but I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation approach, which is not the DCF method.\n\nI like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let\u2019s take a look at what Amazon earnings/share will be by 2025.\n\nI implied for the 3 main streams of [revenues](https://ibb.co/KVnYyqC) which are North American Sales, International Sales and AWS sales a rate of growth similar to the one we had this year but with gradual declines each subsequent year. I also used pretty much the same average [cost of sales](https://ibb.co/3sv40Sf) which includes the actual cost of sales and the fulfillment costs. This has stood at about 75% of the net revenues for the past years and might actually improve, but I do want to stay on the safe side. So, by 2025 the gross [REVENUES](https://ibb.co/xSdQX9P) should reach around $244B, assuming margins stay pretty much in line, though it\u2019s likely they will improve margins, with International sales becoming a little more profitable and AWS brining more &amp; more money.\n\nWe also have to estimated what the Capex &amp; Operating [expenses](https://ibb.co/HHM0PfS) would be by 2025. I think Amazon should see somewhat of a slowdown of Capex, R&amp;D &amp; SG&amp;A spending, as they have seen a huge boost in the past year, and I think it should normalize, so I will imply an 8% annual growth for these, which is still very high.\n\n[Next](https://ibb.co/F75r4jN), we look at the interest income, expense and other losses or incomes for the company. This numbers are small compared to the vast cash flows of the company that they can even be ignored, but let\u2019s assume they see a 10% decrease both in income and expenses related to interest while also not suffering losses but having a smaller other income by 10%/year. This would results in an almost $114B income pre-tax for 2025.\n\nAs I showed you earlier, the effective tax rate for Amazon has been around 16% in the past 4 years, despite the nominal US tax rate. For safety reasons I will use an 18% tax rate, though this should stay closers to 16% on the back of the International taxes. So, with an 18% tax rate, the [FINAL](https://ibb.co/d7ZCstY) income for the company after everything has been taken into consideration should be $93.25B.\n\nFor the outstanding [shares](https://ibb.co/x33HyxP), I will be conservative and imply a .5% increase in outstanding shares, as the company has been very careful in avoiding the dilution of the stock. So, with that increase by 2025, we should have around 531M shares.\n\nSo, [BASED](https://ibb.co/282sK42) on Price to Future Earnings/share we can see Amazon is currently trading at almost 18 times 2025 earnings/share, which compared to the 90 multiple it\u2019s trading right now would be insanely low. I can see Amazon continuing to trade at very high P/E for the foreseeable future. So, with a 25 PE price the company should trade at 4400$, while with a 50 PE ratio, the stock should be close to 9000$/share, which is insane when you think about that number, but maybe Bezos will listen and split the shares finally.\n\n[Compare](https://ibb.co/ChhMP6Z) this to the [DCF](https://ibb.co/1TM7FWd) valuation and you see that the Perpetuity approach is similar to a 35 PE ratio, while the AVG approach is similar to a 25 PE Ratio, which I don\u2019t expect Amazon to trade at, not even in 5 years.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my actual price targets\u2026 I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Amazon trade at is $4828 which would imply a return of over 54%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Amazon will trade at 6145$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 96.5% return on the [current price](https://ibb.co/FwrMhnY). My most bullish case though is $7900, which would imply a return of 152%, with that number being mind-blowing given the current valuation of the company\u2026 but I guess we do have to start getting used with such high numbers\u2026 I guess decades ago when we saw the first millionaire or billionaire, people would have also thought that it was crazy\u2026 but crazy is for the limited minds only I believe.\n\nSo yeah guys, here is my [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/XF5h87q) price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 40 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 40-50.\n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/edit) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for Amazon by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nKeep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Amazon has in the past. The company has increased in [value](https://ibb.co/QpDg4mp) by more 450% in just the past 5 years and is over 160.000% up since it started [trading](https://ibb.co/KyDzqWq). So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against one of the biggest and fastest growing companies in the world?\n\nThe company also has pristine [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/Bgxf91m), with more than $112B in current assets vs only $102B in current liabilities, with over $282B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the analysts expect a similar [EPS](https://ibb.co/R48nrDF) by 2025, of around $166 compared to $171/shares that my Growth Valuations are projecting. So, it seems that this could be a very reasonable upside for the company.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Amazon?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/kHwWq4x), so starting with the high the stock made before the September sell-off. The stock has been trading in this wedge formation for the last couple of months with increasingly higher lows. The stock isn\u2019t overbought and hasn\u2019t been since it saw an RSI of 73 when it reached the all-time highs. I think with this wedge formation building up, with increasing higher lows and with the pattern of trading likely being an Elliot Theory 5 [WAVE](https://ibb.co/MBqPyc2) formation, I think it\u2019s very likely we see a breakout in the near future, maybe just before earnings, and I expect this breakout to mimic the last run the stock had of about 23% up. So, with that 23% increase mirrored that would result the stock should peak around $[3900](https://ibb.co/VBpRv6j), which I expect to see by the end of the year.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 47 [analysts](https://ibb.co/YT0BPTP) on wall street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $3800 and a high price target of $4600 which is insane for a return in the next 12 months, as 46 of the 47 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Amazon. So yet again, the $3900 isn\u2019t that out of possibilities even as Wall Street\u2019s analysts expect\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own Amazon stock and I believe it still has tremendous room to grow, so I would start building a position as I expect the company to resume its uptrend sooner rather than later and the next catalyst may be just a couple of weeks away with the last quarter [earnings](https://ibb.co/nLhCJpk) expected to be announced by the end of January.\n\nAnd I shouldn\u2019t forget to mention that I believe Amazon is one of the most stable stocks out with very good [leadership](https://ibb.co/7KS3yS6), and with large institutional [holders](https://ibb.co/8Dj1W3C) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Morgan Stanley owning huge amounts of the company.\n\nSo, [THIS](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my projections and my expectations for the company, and if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/)\n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Alright retards and autists, listen up. AAPL earnings were last week and they were spectacular, sales up 21% YOY, SMASHED 100 billion in revenue in one quarter for the first time ever at 111.4 billion, sales in all product categories are up double digit percentage points and bassicaly crushed the revenue estimates for every one of their product categories aside from being under by 0.01% for mac revenue (mac revenue still up 21% YOY). Earnings per share were at $1.68 vs the estimated $1.41. It's also important to note that sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are up 57%.\n\nBut what happened? You ask, like a wide eyed retard fresh outta mommies cunt. We've all seen this shit before, blowout earning report and a steep sell of straight afterwards. It's why only the retardiest of retards play earnings. They almost always recover after said sell off and If you look at the chart, apple is prime for a swift recovery judging by the Extremely bullish Batman throwing a batarang pattern that developed in the last few hours on friday.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/KCjZdbZ\n\nThe reason I believe the recovery wil be swift is because this sell off was almost certainly caused by a few big funds needing liquidity to cover their GME shorts + short more GME. Also autists liquidating their positions to buy more gme. This dip will be bought right back up by institutions that have no interest in GME.\n\nTLDR; AAPL going back over 140 by the end of next week cuz I said so.\n\nPostions: AAPL FEB 05 140c , AAPL MAR 05 145c",

        "selftext": "I'm in $GME gang deep and wonder if we could pitch some business ideas to Gamestop here. Ryan &amp; the board are likely aware of the subreddit, and there's a lot of attention on it, so maybe in addition to highlighting how much WE LIKE THE STOCK we could also cold pitch some growth opportunities.\n\nI really love the new CEO and board changes, as a Gamestop customer in my youth I even applied to it as my second job. I applied as a store manager, without any managing experience, at 16, because I loved games. I filled out the application and stapled a second, lined notebook paper to the application, which was my \"why do you want to work here\" answer. It was a really long passionate diatribe about my Counterstrike skills developing our clan both during tournaments as well as while we're not gaming by hosting LAN parties and activities. I was serious and was crushed I didn't get a callback. I worked in IS/IT for a few years and moved on. I work in tech now and I have an MBA, and oddly before this week I would never thought to pitch to Gamestop, but I love the idea of pitching Gamestop.\n\nWhy? Gamestop was a portal to reach totally random kids who loved everything I did. We used to all harass our parents to take us to two places: local LAN party joints or Gamestop. We didn't have any money, it was essentially a dumping ground for poor kids, but we'd be respectful of both businesses. Yeah you could meet strangers online, but that's weird (or weirder now than it was then) and I am STILL friends with people I met at LAN parties and Gamestop.\n\nThere's a lot of potential for physical retail spaces and there's time during Covid19 to transform those before we reopen this bitch with a brand new $20B Gamestop in 2021/2022.\n\nCould we remake LAN parties, arcades, all the grimey old 80's spaces that slowly were demolished through the late 90's? The lifeblood of America? Yes we brought gaming \"home,\" and sold more consumer devices, but we lost the in-person human experience. Can we write Gamestop into Stranger Things and every other TV/movie coming out in the next two years to boost the hype train? Yes.\n\nWhat if the game/console sales went the Chewy model (with local pickup if shipping to a residence isn't possible) and the new albeit small retail space was used for game, console, but also STEM/educational programming, bring Black Girls Code in and be inclusive, gamers aren't all blond white boys. My nieces and nephews don't want, despite all my efforts, to play just Warhammer 40k as the Trukk Boyz. My favorite niece does and growls \"WAAAGHHHHH\" but her sister plays Minecraft.\n\nMy friends who are parents, even if they were or are gamers and nerds, are confused about what content is safe for their kids these days. When Among Us came out my sister asked if it was safe for kids.. and I didn't know to be honest. We grew up on Gamestop.. why not have it shepherd the next generation of entertainment through diverse programming and informing parents. Subscribe to Gamespot basic for a newsletter about family friendly games and activities you can play with multiple generations, kids and parents, just kids, just parents, etc. Hype games like Jackbox, not just Cyberpunk.\n\nYou know what everyone pitches and hates pitching? Social media. Social media got too broad, it needs some structure, can we revisit a cross between GameSpy and ICQ that lets you instantly play games with friends, coworkers, family, your kids.. from anywhere? Maybe its an app, maybe its an API, maybe its tied to a platform like Apple messaging but maybe its a PWA and goes anywhere. You can game, but you can also reflect your life and experiences like Instagram (without the privacy/snooping/hate speech) so people can share and grow. Gamespot would regulate the shit out of content with super supportive moderation and a heavy fucking hand.\n\nSimilarly to Gamestop's business partner Microsoft's Xbox, they can help censor and report malicious or offensive content and hate speech in online experiences. That crap has no place. Instead of pitching mountain dew and doritos, jolt cola, top ramen like at LAN parties, sell some nutritious and not too-marked-up food staples because parents will just leave their kids there for a while.\n\nWhile the parents are there, hook them into gaming with their kids, and being gaming mentors for their kids' friends and other folks. Gaming mentors can be a badge, old nerds love that shit, or offer discounts to game subscriptions and services. Mentor/GM/advise parents for X hours and get game exclusives. Teach them that grandma and grandpa like games, that we can all bond through entertainment.\n\nGamestop used to be the linchpin, similarly to GameSpy for finding friends playing games, or ICQ being the communicator, whatever. Game studios threw them away, but lost their ability to talk to their customers. Keep Gamestop retail stores as these mini arcades, basically a fun version of the Apple store, where yeah, you can buy a console and Nintendo minifigs or whatever.. but a kid can use their Gamestop save card and tap into their last progress with some puzzle fighter, or tap in to get an exclusive skin for Minecraft by solving some STEM puzzles, whatever. Don't like retail stores? Great! Get rid of them- we're in an age where you can host wide user research panels through Zoom, Teams, whatever.\n\nGame studios and hardware/console makers can tap into their raw customer base here. Transparently advertise paid panel sessions where actual kids who play the game can just call Blizzard a bag of fucking dicks and Blizzard will pay to hear it. Good developers are desperate to hear feedback, good studios will flock to it, and Gamestop employees are brilliant, they can easily crosstrain as user research panelists/experts. Shit, introduce that into the transaction and sell game studios anonymized customer reports. At checkout or if customers ask about products and services, write it into the process of sales advisement (not pushing games though!) on collecting feedback and make SURE the customer understands their feedback to employees will be used to help shape games- but its anonymized, no user data collected.\n\nWith all this opportunity also comes trust... put trust #1. Microsoft with Satya was all like \"play well with others\" and \"truuuust bitches.\" There's been gaps sure, but them and Apple under Cook are trying (and should) lock advertisers out of their ecosystems. Nobody should be reading your kids' gaming or reading habits, but the parents. Fuck Facebook, fuck Robinhood, etc.\n\nNow this is a low effort elevator pitch but if $GME or any of their partners, potential partners, want to make a play, I'll sign up to write a pitch deck, a one pager, whatever. I'm an MBA in tech, former Gamestop customer, raised in computers.. but I'm also not a gamer. I mostly garden and do outdoor shit, but I still love some wholesome entertainment. Seeing AOC stream Among Us on Twitch with fellow congresswomen blew my fucking mind. Let's fucking do this! Sincerely, *diamond hands*.\n\nPS.. grow from within, Gamestop employees are, I'm sure, itching to get in on ground floor growth. Having a resource like that to tap for leadership opportunities is huge.\n\nPPS.. Sherrilyn Ifill wrote a fucking beautiful report for Starbucks on how to engage communities after Starbucks shit the bed for the .. fourth time or whatever and fucking arrested their own customers for buying coffee while being Black. You want the literal business plan read \"[Toward a Vision for Racial Equity &amp; Inclusion at Starbucks: Review and Recommendations](https://www.demos.org/research/toward-vision-racial-equity-inclusion-starbucks-review-and-recommendations)\" and also buy her books, and watch every recorded lecture of hers you can find online, then contract her &amp; her network to tailor this FOR GAMESTOP. Gamestop was, and is about community- diverse and inclusive community, and racial equity &amp; inclusion should be #1. Growing up in Chicago dragging the few PC's we had to empty corner offices all over the north and south side to hook up and play Command and Conquer, AOE, whatever, that is some shit for everybody. It is the ultimate free childcare for parents. Your kids will play this for TWENTY FOUR HOURS while eating uncooked ramen and BE HAPPY.",

        "selftext": "**Hardware:**\n\nI think the smartest defensive move Facebook can make at this stage is doing whatever it takes to become a major player in consumer hardware. Even if they breakeven, or lose money on this endeavor it can be treated as user acquisition costs for the people who wouldn't make a Facebook account otherwise, or as a way to make Facebook accounts as sticky as possible to protect against people leaving the platform. Anecdotally, I've seen **people that have preached \"Facebook is evil\" for years, say that not they will not ever delete their newly open accounts** because if they did their Oculus hardware wouldn't work, and they'd lose all of their purchases.\n\nFacebook is dominating the growing VR market with an iron fist. **Non-advertising revenue grew 156%** in Q4, and IDC estimates 3 million [Quest 2's were sold in Q4](https://twitter.com/somospostpc/status/1354879840097337349). Oculus Quest 2 has stellar reviews, despite the mandatory Facebook account for use. Facebook's VR devices also use Messenger for messages, Workplace for enterprise, and I believe [Facebook Horizon](https://www.oculus.com/facebook-horizon/) (which is integrated with the FB app) will eventually be the place users load into initially, and launch third party apps from.\n\nHigh investment cost makes it unlikely that other social media company can compete with Facebook in hardware (especially AR/VR), and this should give Facebook a permanent utility advantage against its peers. The companies that could compete, big tech, and gaming giants seem unwilling to make the investment to compete. I think they're aware that Facebook is completely fine making $0 to be dominant in the VR space, and that's scared them away in addition to facts like VR being a relatively small market for them.[Apple is rumored to be considering a release of a Quest-like headset in later 2022, but the device will be priced far above $1000 according to Mark Gurman.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses)\n\nVR is where I'm most confident in Facebook's ability to achieve its hardware dreams, but consumer AR is also an area where its only competition in terms of investments made is Apple. So I think their chances there are decent too. Facebook is working on long term AR glasses, but is also releasing Smartglasses in collaboration with Luxottica (Ray-Ban and Oakley) this year. There's also Facebook's line of smart video chatting devices, Portal.\n\n**Traditionally Listed Moats**\n\nIntangible assets consisting of the vast amount of data users have shared: **sustained and growing**, but people are also sharing things about themselves on other apps increasingly.\n\nGrowth of users means **network effects still growing**\n\nNumber and diversity of advertisers, and advertiser verticals **still growing**\n\n**Competition?**\n\nThere is rising social media competition, and always the threat of new entrants. That being said, competition seems to carve out niches, so they aren't competing as directly as we'd think. The closest thing to Facebook the Blue app, for connecting with family and friends is Instagram. Competing apps can have similar features, but the main utilities are different. Tik Tok is mostly a short video app, Youtube is a long video app, Twitter is a breaking news app, Reddit is a communities app, etc. **Facebook's utility first and foremost is connecting with REAL people who's identity you can verify, like friends and family. Like previously mentioned, the closest competitor is Instagram.**\n\n**Messaging**\n\nThere can be lack of differentiation here, but **Messenger tied to Facebook, Instagram, Portal and Oculus.** I suspect it'll be tied to future hardware as well. Whatsapp has network effects, and may one day have lock-in comparable to Chinese super apps (at least that's what's being worked towards). iMessage is the the main competitor here, because they are automatically installed on every iPhone\n\n**Misc**\n\nI think Facebook Marketplace, the Craigslist alternative **benefits greatly from Facebook using real identities**, and is an overall better product. If you want to sell something locally FB Marketplace is the best option, and I think it's a strong reason to have an account. Usage of Marketplace is growing.\n\nThe integration with Jio in India, and importance in Indian society is worth mentioning for Whatsapp.\n\nFacebook Groups, have competition in the form of Reddit, and Discord. The edge here will be real identities, and the tools they are building to make moderating a Facebook group profitable (subscriptions, etc)\n\nThe only other pure \"Real Identity social network\" is Linkedin is a professional network.\n\n**Problems**\n\n**No young people use Facebook?** This seems to be a US centric cliche, as Facebook is popular among all age demographics around the world. [According to Pew Research 76% of people 18-24 use Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/), only superseded by Youtube. For teens in 2018, [51% of teens used Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/) which is good in my opinion for a social network not targeted to teens like Tik Tok. I personally think the utility of Facebook kicks in after college age, **but regardless if there is a problem, I think the cure can be User Acquisition through hardware.**\n\n**Chance of mass exodus?** again, **mitigated by the lock-in of hardware**, but this is a concern of mine based on Facebook's reputation. **1. Privacy**, there is truth to some criticism here, because Facebook's business model does depend on data collection, and in many ways is opposed to strict definitions of privacy, but much of it is also pushed by myth like \"Facebook sells data\". **Facebook has the same business model as its advertising funded peers, but perception is what matters,** and Facebook is losing the perception battle. **2. Politics,** In my opinion has been half of Facebook's reputation problem. Recently Zuck said that **they are trying to make Facebook less political by not recommending political groups, and lowering reach on political posts**. Also, Donald Trump being gone should make the next 4 years less politically controversial. Since Facebook is in the business of advertising, and people can mostly say what they want, **there's always the small chance of a #DeleteFacebook movement reaching critical mass based on these themes.**\n\n**Being banned in countries?** Mitigated **by becoming a hardware player,** but this is an unlikely outcome for many reasons that my hands are too tired to elaborate on.\n\n**Apple's privacy stance and iOS 14:** The hit to revenue estimates I've seen are between 1%-7%, but it could also be a boost to revenue **since third party signals being reduced will give the edge to whoever has the best first party signals**, we'll have wait to see. This is something to watch closely, but transferring third party data into first party data by having ecommerce on the platform through initiatives like **Facebooks shops, and Instagram shopping can be the cure**. Also, **being in control of hardware mitigates this risk**\n\n**Antitrust-** generally **not concerned**\n\n**Privacy as a theme that is adversarial to advertising -** slightly concerned but **I don't think ad funded business models are going anywhere**, many people like not paying for things\n\n**Might add more to this later...**",

        "selftext": "Rocket \ud83d\ude80 \nMoon \ud83c\udf19 \nSqueeze \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\n\nWe are so dumb, we\u2019re right about this.  If you\u2019ve read anything on this sub, you know we can be irrational.  \n\n\nIf you know anything about investing, you know the markets can be irrational longer than investors can remain solvent.  \n\n\nWell guys, we\u2019re the most irrational I\u2019ve ever seen.  And we\u2019re friggin good at it.  \n*Ain\u2019t no way anyone can out solvent our irrationality*\n\n\nBut if you don\u2019t believe me, here\u2019s some actually talking points:  \n\n\nGME is Not dipping.  The math just isn\u2019t there.  This is not a normal rally/hype.  It was a momentum thing.  It\u2019s now becoming a squeeze within the next week.  \n\n\nThis doubling in under 48hrs has made all shorts unprofitable.  It doesn\u2019t matter where they entered.  \n\n\nShort seller\u2019s peak profit happens if a stock goes to $0.  No one expects GME to be at $0 even in the next few years.  But assuming it could a month from now, let\u2019s do the maths. \n\n\nMost shorts got in around $15 or less.  That means the most they can make is $15, **IF** GME goes to $0 (it won\u2019t). \n\n\nNow any time you borrow anything, you have to pay interest on it, this includes shares.  The current interest rate is 45% (or higher).  The interest is on the price of the current shares, not the price they bought in at.  \n\n\nThis means on a share price of $40, they are paying nearly $0.06 a day to short it.  Doesn\u2019t sound too expensive right? Until you realize that in less than 28 days (if they allow it compound), they will have paid more in interest than they could ever gain, even if GME went to $0 in February. \n\n\nKeep in mind, once a short seller realizes it is literally impossible to make money, they just need to time their exit.  Since this is a stampede of short sellers, the best time to exit is right away.  They literally can\u2019t wait 3 weeks, or else they might as well quite a few more dollars a share (from the interest they\u2019re going to accrue).  \n\n\nKeep in mind, this is all voluntary covering.  There are also tons of accounts out there that will now have to cover due to margin calls and such.  \n\n\nKeep in mind that 71 million shares are shorted.  That\u2019s more than are technically available.  \n\n\nKeep in mind that 20% of shares are locked up by Cohen &amp;amp; such, who cannot sell for a few more months.  So that leaves even less shares for the shorts.  \n\n\nOnce most of the shorts cover (within 3 weeks), the price won\u2019t drop overnight.  They have to buy more shares than available and anyone left holding shorts will still be buying.  And by that time, a new base &amp;amp; support level should have been established.  \n\n\n*****\nThinking of FOMOing? You should be fine with shares.  Still could see upside of 50%+ \n*****\nI recommend buying shares, cause IV is crazy high and if MM somehow finds a way to eff with people, they will.  Sometimes they are smarter than me (but hey, that\u2019s their job, I\u2019m just an idiot). \n*****\n\n\nPositions: \n\n104 shares @ $20.15\nSold $22 call (much regret, didn\u2019t know squeeze would happen so soon, I\u2019m an idiot)\nBought $38c 1/15exp \nHope to add shares tomorrow morning &amp;amp; maybe a call for next Friday.  But ... I have a high risk tolerance and have made a nice chunk, so if my calls go tits up, don\u2019t care. \n\n\n*****\nShameless plug for the next huge move: \nCash out half next week &amp;amp; dump it in Apple calls (1/29 or 03/21) any strike, can\u2019t go wrong.  I have $200c, $160c, $135c, 75 shares.  \n*****\n\n\nTL;DR: \n50% upside for GME\n\n\nShorts have to cover in less than 25 days or they literally will lose more than they could ever gain from shorting.  \n\n\n45% interest payments on current share price hurts shorts.  \n\n\n20% of shares are tied up &amp;amp; not able to be sold. \n\n\nShorters need to buy almost 200% of available shares in the next 3 weeks (assuming they want to cap their losses at 100%). \n\n\nNot too late to jump in with shares. \n\n\nDon\u2019t wait for a dip.\n\n\nEdit: interest maths - principle still holds",

        "selftext": "What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

What is my price prediction for Disney?** **Read until the end of the post** **as I reveal my price target for Disney and what I expect to happen next**\n\n**\\~Very Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and stock analysis in which we will go into an in-depth analysis about Disney\u2019s stock! We are going to talk about Disney as a company and what\u2019s the upside for the stock! So, let\u2019s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions, cash flows analysis and my price target for the stock in the next years &amp; months.\n\nLet\u2019s start by talking a little about [Disney](https://ibb.co/PMhMz9f), yeah, I know everyone knows Disney, their movies, their parks and much more, but I believe Disney is still undervalued at this current price, especially due to their Disney+ and other streaming businesses which have taken of since the start of 2020.\n\nDisney is the biggest entertainment company in the world, and has the 20th biggest market cap as they operate a number of profitable segments including cable networks like Disney, ESPN and many more others, while they also have a vast segment of parks &amp; experiences including multiple Disneyland resorts, cruise lines and many others. Disney also operates a studio entertainment business under multiple big names like Marvel, Pixar, Walt Disney pictures and also offer Direct-to-Consumer networks &amp; streaming services like Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and others. The company has over 200K employees and is nearing 100 years since it was founded.\n\nSo, we have to talk about the adjustment Disney has made starting in 2020. The company has cut the [dividend](https://ibb.co/YQQ8xLL) payouts and has focus its efforts into growing the company, with the company accelerating their move to an elite streaming business, which was supposed to have a time horizon of at least 3-4 years, and which has now surpassed all their expectations, and made the stock pop to all time highs of over $180 just recently.\n\nDisney just had their latest Investors Day meeting in which they announced a lot of promising business opportunities for the company related to their developing streaming business.\n\nThey announced at least 10 Marvel [series](https://ibb.co/RQrxPfR) like Captain Marvel 2, a new Doctor Strange development while continuing [movies](https://ibb.co/87CcQ7B) for Thor, Black Panther and [others](https://ibb.co/Dpr73G2). They also announced at least 10 Star Wars [series](https://ibb.co/9HBrXZj) [including](https://ibb.co/PZkKTC4) the continuation of their big hit The Mandalorian and also provided updates on more child friendly productions with 15 Disney &amp; Pixar [series](https://ibb.co/HNkMYvT).\n\nThe company has far outpaced any of their previous [GUIDANCE](https://ibb.co/vhWGCRd), as their initial guidance in all 3 big streaming services, Disney+, Hulu &amp; ESPN have been reached in less than a year, with Disney+ and ESPN+ hitting the top of their expectations for 2024 while Hulu is just shy of their bottom expectations, as Disney+ was a hit since its start, with over 10M signups in the first [DAY](https://ibb.co/PW4WRfY).\n\nDisney+ also keeps expanding into multiple countries, as they continued to launch the streaming business in over 15 [countries](https://ibb.co/Kwk9dd1) just recently in November, as their streaming services are [offered](https://ibb.co/4N8s3yt) on most devices like Android &amp; Apple devices, Amazon\u2019s Fire TV, Roku streaming platform and Google\u2019s devices.\n\nThe company has extreme pricing power due to their capability to generate revenues from their other income streams but haven\u2019t chosen to abuse that with only minor increases in price while also offering a great Disney [Bundle](https://ibb.co/R2p28zM) for just $13/month that includes the top 3 streaming services, Disney+, Hulu &amp; ESPN+.\n\nHulu has seen a huge subscriber [growth](https://ibb.co/XkVCK72) in the past years, adding around 8M subscribers/year since 2017 as they offer multiple subscription [choices](https://ibb.co/sFnV4gV), starting from 6$ up to 71$ for their no ads &amp; live TV service. After these results, Disney has slightly increased their bottom-line expectations for the [service](https://ibb.co/4sK1HR7) to 50M by 2024 and are expecting Hulu to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/W3C6Ybm) as soon as FY 2023.\n\nThey also revised the [ESPN+](https://ibb.co/S0wx121) expectations from between 8-12M to an incredible 20-30M subscribers range by 2024 as they also expect this service to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/4S8Qj8b) by FY 2023.\n\nBut guys, by far, the biggest [guidance](https://ibb.co/3swTzSG) upgrade for Disney has come from Disney+, with a revised guidance of over 230M and a top expectation of 260M subscribers by 2024, which is 30% more than Netflix has right now, after over 20 years since it was founded. They are also planning on [pricing](https://ibb.co/zZszZWR) Disney+ at $8/month starting this March, as they have revised the content [expense](https://ibb.co/kKK2Rxq) to over $8B for 2024, more than double their previous estimates, as they look to provide as much and as good as possible content for their customers.\n\nDespite the huge number of subscribers, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/1Lrscqx) is still losing money due to very high costs of getting the service of the ground, but the company has revised their expectations and expect peak operating losses from Disney+ to come up this year and are expecting profitability by 2024, which is pretty much on schedule.\n\nSo, let\u2019s go a little through the latest quarterly &amp; yearly results for [Disney](https://ibb.co/x3n4Bmb). The company has been hugely affected due to the events that happened in 2020, as they were forced to close or operate at a significant reduced capacity their Parks, Experiences and Products segment. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $0.20 for the 4th quarter and a loss of $2.02 for the year. Despite this loss I think the company has done as good as was possibly expected, as the situation accelerate their growth of their Disney+ service.\n\nThe company [reported](https://ibb.co/Bjpz16L) just over $7B in Media revenues for the 4th quarter and over $28B for the year, both of them being increases of at least 11% vs the previous year. Disney also reported a 41% increase in Direct-to-Consumer revenues for the 4th quarter with almost $17B in revenues for the year, while on the other hand both the Studio Entertainment &amp; the Park, Experiences &amp; Products segment saw a major loss of revenues, with both of them being down more than 50% for the 4th quarter vs 2019.\n\n[Disney](https://ibb.co/G0KBJQG) also improved their operating results in both Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer but only manage to obtain an operating income from their Media Networks and their Studio Entertainment business, totaling an operating income of just over $8B for the year, a 45% decrease over 2019.\n\nTheir latest moves to accelerate the growth of Disney+ had a big effect in the operating [results](https://ibb.co/t3wfwzC), as the costs of rolling out Disney+ eat up the revenues, while very few of their Movies were actually released to the cinema, which also impacted their Studio Entertainment top &amp; bottom line. Also, to be noted that the eliminations segment includes the inter-segment transaction between their Media &amp; Studio segments to their Direct-to-Consumer segment.\n\n[Disney](https://ibb.co/SxXHZLK) also saw their Parks &amp; Experiences revenues decline drastically as well as their operating results as a result of the closing or operating at a reduced capacity for all of their resorts, which is estimated to have had a negative impact of $2.4B for their operating income.\n\nStudio Entertainment was hit just as bad with a decline of more than 50% in both revenues and operating income as theatrical releases were mostly put on pause as most of the theaters around the world have been closed or have operated at a significantly reduced capacity.\n\nWe also saw Direct-to-Consumer operating loss and revenues [improve](https://ibb.co/G7Sg19n) for the 4th quarter, as ESPN+ &amp; Hulu were a boost while Disney+ continued to burn money at a very high rate, that is needed for a rapid growth of the service.\n\nWe can also see that all 3 major streaming services had a big increase year/year, with ESPN &amp; HULU gaining more than 7M paid subscribers while Disney skyrocketed to over 86M after the latest numbers from their investors meeting. Despite this numbers the only increase in monthly revenue/subscriber was seen in [Hulu's](https://ibb.co/LzmrvwV) top package while the rest of them dropped, very likely due to the high number of promotions in the Asian markets.\n\nIt\u2019s also to be noted that though most of their parks &amp; resorts were affected, Disney didn\u2019t stop investing in them and had a [Capex](https://ibb.co/2jsth35) of over $4B in 2020.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/dk88L7f) also received other sources of income due to their gains in DraftKings, but most of these gains were offset by their interest expenses.\n\nSo, you should now that I am bull on Disney but I am willing to hear other opinions so don\u2019t be afraid to leave a comment down below!\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest [plans](https://ibb.co/9WxkCyd) announced by them and used some estimates and expectations of their revenues streams to normalize in the next years. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/mtb7s5y), though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.\n\nI implied the same growth rates for the total revenues based on my growth projections and also implied that EBITDA margin will slowly recover to the levels it stood before the massive investments in their streaming business, as the EBITDA margins [stood](https://ibb.co/Svr8NjN) at over 30% before that, and with streaming business being a very lucrative affair I can easily see that happen again.\n\nI also used the Depreciation &amp; Amortization from 2020 and implied a 10% growth, while also doing the same for the Net Working Capital. I used a 15% capex increases like I will do in my growth projections, and used a 9% discount rate, which is above the avg SP500 return in the past 60years.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for Disney I think the EBITDA approach is better suited as I expect the stock to be re-rated after they start to turn profitable on their streaming business and you will see with my growth method that it shows pretty much the same results.\n\nSo, this means we have an estimated $56B worth of FCF for a 9% discount rate. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 3.5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Disney will be worth almost $500B by 2025. So, let\u2019s do the math for the growth approach and with a share count of 1.81B, that would mean a stock price of $175 and would imply a return of just over 2%. But I don\u2019t expect this to be the best way to value the company. I think the EBITDA approach is better suited for the growth that lies ahead for the company. So, I wanted to be conservative and used only a 16 times EBITDA, which is the last multiple Disney traded before 2020, though I think with this new approach to the business we can see Disney valued at even higher multiples, maybe even 20 to 25. So, with this 16 times multiple, the stock would be undervalued by over 40% right now, but for safety reasons I would use an average of the 2 approaches. So, I expect [Disney](https://ibb.co/hM8mqnd) to trade around 210$ using the DCF model, which would imply a 22% return, which seems pretty good.\n\nI think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation [approach](https://ibb.co/jkL0JG9) for the future.\n\nI like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let\u2019s take a look at what Disney earnings/share will be by 2025.\n\nFor my [projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c/edit#gid=1003936878) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. So, for the Media Networks I implied a 10% increase for next year and a decreasing growth after that and did pretty much the same for the Studio Entertainment Business. I did however imply a return to normal in Parks &amp; Experiences revenues by 2022 and a slowing growth after that, while for the Direct-to-Consumer I implied a bigger growth rate as by their own forecast, Disney+ should account for around $20B in revenues by 2025 on its own.\n\nFor Disney\u2019s cost of sales, I maintained the 68% expense ratio on their Media Networks, while for their Parks &amp; Experiences I implied a very big cost of sales for the next 2 years and expect that to normalize towards the end of the period. Meanwhile for the Studio Entertainment business I actually used a bigger expense ratio just to be safe and for the Direct-to-Consumer cost of sales I implied a loss for 2021, a break even for 2022 and just starting to become positive after 2023 ending with a cost ratio of 75% in 2025. For the eliminations revenues and costs I implied a gradual 10% decrease in each year, but this shouldn\u2019t affect the results that much in the end.\n\nI used their Capex spending from 2020 and implied a 15% annual growth, as this will continue to increase at least for the next couple of years, while for the interest income &amp; expenses I implied a 10% annual decrease, but this numbers are again so small that they don\u2019t impact the end result that much, and didn\u2019t want to assume and other significant losses or income.\n\nI used the nominal US TAX rate of 21% and implied a .5% dilution of the stock each year.\n\nSo, let take a [recap](https://ibb.co/nj7sX5h), I expect Disney to have over $137B in revenues in 2025 and almost $35B in gross revenues. After subtracting their $8B capex and the almost $700M related to interest, and also account for the tax rate, Disney should have just over $20B in income after tax or just over $11 in earnings/share. So, adjusted for the .5% dilution, this would mean the stock is trading at just over 15 times price to 2025 earnings right now.\n\nI know Disney has traded under a PE of 20 historically, but with them renouncing dividends and focusing on growth, especially as I can see every streaming business being valued very highly right now, I think we can see a multiple expansion on Disney vs the previous normal. So, depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 20 and 35, the stock can trade between $220 and almost $390.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [Here](https://ibb.co/849LJH3) are my actual price targets\u2026 I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Disney trade at is $249 which would imply a return of over 45%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Disney will trade at 304$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 77% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $359, which would imply a return of 110%. So yeah guys, this are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 20 &amp; 25 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 25 and 30 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 30-35.\n\nSo here is the [FULL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c) spreadsheet that I have projected for Disney by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nKeep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Disney has had just in the past year in the past. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/BP8SVHK) in value by more 18% despite all the obstacles it has faced and was up 57% in the 4 years [before](https://ibb.co/bHxHf5h) 2020. So yes, I think Disney will be one of the best re-opening plays and stay-at-home trades as well, so a win-win no matter what.\n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/JntSMr8), with more than $35B in current assets vs only $26B in current liabilities and with over $200B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future, even after the bad year they had in 2020.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the [analysts](https://ibb.co/1sRqCTB) expect somewhat smaller revenues by 2025, of around $115B compared to $137B that my Growth Valuations are projecting. But I think this haven\u2019t been revised enough and don\u2019t take into account fully what the streaming business will mean for them even after their other revenue streams come back to normal.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Disney?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/cTCvdgf), Disney has had a history of gapping up and then filling back the gap-up in the past 6 months with the stock doing so 2 times. But more recently they didn\u2019t fill the gap-up after the vaccine news and even gapped even higher than that after the revised subscribers\u2019 numbers revealed at the investors day. The stock was almost overbought and overbought for pretty long stretches of times in the last 6 months, but right now the RSI has dropped to 51, which could be a sign the stock is ready to move up once again. So, my personal opinion is that we can see the stock trade flat or even drop a little more but not below 158$ before the next quarterly [earnings](https://ibb.co/k8x6cCW) are released in February. Last time around they beat expectations by quite a lot and I think they might actually pull it off again with the increasing strength in the streaming business, and that might be enough to push the stock even higher. So, using the [DCF](https://ibb.co/ZfcJZz9) valuation, I think we can see Disney trading at around $210 by the end of the year, especially if things start to get back to normal and their parks &amp; other revenues streams come back at increased strength.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 27 [analysts](https://ibb.co/VJNg2m5) on Wall Street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $181 and a high price target of $220, as 20 of the 27 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Disney. So yet again, I think the analyst are undershooting the price of Disney, as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own Disney stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops to $160.\n\nOne last thing to mention about Disney is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 65% of the float being held by big [funds](https://ibb.co/5KRGT0Y) like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Bob [Chapek](https://ibb.co/1JJzyq2) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO early in 2020, and has driven Disney to a renewed approach to their business, so, if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c)!\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Mods: Please don\u2019t delete, hear me out\n\nTLDR: GameStop\u2019s long-term success is not a meme. They are actually poised to be the next trillion-dollar company. They are still highly undervalued despite the risk. \n\nLong Rant: I am not a financial advisor. I\u2019m just a simple ape that wants a better future for us all.\n\nI started investing in my early 20\u2019s back in 2011. I\u2019ve actually avoided wallstreetbets for a long time because YOLO and loss porn were never my cup of tea. But somewhere along the way you all grew up. You found out the difference between gambling and investing. You see, I\u2019ve always been of the opinion that any type of short-term strategy is gambling when it comes to buying or selling stock. Markets are susceptible to wild fluctuation and you are a fool if you think you can time the market for a perfect quick flip. I\u2019ve avoided options and have never taken a short position because I understand just how risky they can be, exposing yourself to potentially unlimited losses is something only the stupidest people are willing to do and they do not deserve to call themselves investors. To be an investor there is only one true strategy and that is buy and HOLD!!!!!!\n\nI remember back in 2012 I read an article about a little-known company at the time called Tesla Motors. They had just announced their model S and I really liked that company. So I bought some shares which at the time cost my $27 each. I held those shares and I waited until model S deliveries started arriving on doorsteps. I waited until charging stations cropped up all over the country. I waited until they announced gigafactories and energy storage. And in 2015 I sold my shares for about $270 per share. I remember bragging about my gains at the time like a paper handed little bitch. \n\nI don\u2019t brag about that anymore. If I would have held on to those shares my life would be in a completely different place now financially. This was one of the hardest lessons I\u2019ve ever learned as an investor and I don\u2019t intend on making it again.\n\nEnough about me, let me tell you why GME is the next trillion-dollar company and why I\u2019m holding my measly 15 shares at $298 until I pass them down to my daughter in my will.\n\nFirst, let me talk about the power of a brand by looking at a company like Apple. In 2001 Apple was also at an all time low. Considered to be a failing company at the time they released a new mp3 layer called the ipod which gained them tremendous appeal amongst a younger generation of customers. Since then Apple has spent billions of dollars per year in marketing and product placements to maintain mass appeal for their brand among young people which are the most difficult demographic to market to. Apple today is worth $2 trillion dollars as a company. And you know what?!\n\nI don\u2019t like Apple. They make overpriced hardware and with overly restrictive software and use subliminal brainwashing tactics to trick you into buying their crappy products.\n\nBut Gamestop? I really like Gamestop, here\u2019s why.\n\nGamestop, much like Apple in 2001 doesn\u2019t look like much on paper, but none of that matters. Because, without spending a single dollar, overnight, GME has become the most beloved brand among younger people. That is incredibly powerful. Never before have so many individuals been this enthusiastically invested in the long-term success of any company.\n\nGameStop has gotten massive amounts of free PR and had undying loyalty from millions of individuals that are not only investors, but customers as well. This whole movement is being driven by GameStop\u2019s loyal customer base. This is monumental!!!\n\nIf I were GameStop\u2019s CEO I would be so giddy right now. Their company has been adopted by the wsb community. It is our child. I would never sell my child. There is no price high enough to sacrifice my own children. GameStop is poised for a very bright future because there isn\u2019t a single new product or pivot that this loyal, undying customer and investor base won\u2019t be on board with. New streaming service? Esports league? Eggs? I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m buying it.\n\nI keep hearing all this bullshit from boomers who think they are experts, and they keep saying GameStop isn\u2019t worth their current price. This is Bullshit! They are lying to put fear into you. GameStop is actually worth so much more! $1,000 per share is not a meme, $10,000 per share is not a meme. In twenty years GameStop will be worth more than Apple, Google, and Amazon combined. Why? Because it is OUR company, not their company. We just bought it, it\u2019s ours and we will make sure it is the best one!\n\nDo not be a paper handed fool that falls for all the bullshit fear from media sources and idiots who are in the pockets of hedge funds and short term gamblers. That\u2019s all they are. Morons who would\u2019ve bet against Apple in 2001. \n\nDiamond hands is not a meme either. It is the simplest and most legitimate form of investing. Buying a stock that you like and holding it until you retire is exactly how you become a millionaire. It\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s good enough for Warren Buffet and it\u2019s good enough for us. Think of all the paper handed pussies that sold Apple in 2001. Is that what you want this to be? The time you made a small buck quickly and missed out on true long-term wealth?\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned there is only one thing that GME can do to mess this up. And that is to turn against us. Don\u2019t dilute shares, don\u2019t bail out the short sellers that were so eager to shutter your doors and ruin your business. We believe in you and will support you so don\u2019t let us down.\n\nAs long as GameStop is loyal to us, the investors. Their future is very bright. Any industry or pivot they would like to pursue is immediately theirs because they have our undying support.\n\nAmazon, Google, Apple\u2026 I don\u2019t like them. But GameStop? I really really like them a lot. I don\u2019t want a Gmail any more, let me get a GameStop mail. I don\u2019t want prime any more, I want GameStop! I don\u2019t want an iPhone, I want GameStop!\n\nDiamond emoji, Hands emoji, Rocket emoji, Moon emoji !!!",

        "selftext": "**There are many new people here, I do not want this to be a distraction. If you have EXTRA money and are already hodling GME, or cannot afford GME you should join the BLNK train.**\n\nSo let me preface this by saying **BLNK** will not be the next **GME**. There will probably not be another **GME**. For starters it's not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn't even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it's own for it's own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a **BLNK** DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.\n\n* A lot of companies with high short interest such as **IRBT** and **BLNK**, along with those more talked about companies such as **AMC** just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around. **BLNK** share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn't even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like **BLNK** stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up *2400%* from 1 year ago. And it's still got relatively small market cap though we aren't in the millions anymore.\n* If **BLNK** were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach **GME**'s current 20b dollar market cap it's share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an **AMC** and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed **GME** squeezed already you're obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that **BLNK** 10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.\n\nIs this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which **BLNK** is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.\n\nOkay so **BLNK** is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype, **BLNK** has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name **BLNK**. Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.\n\n**BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:**\n\n* **Selling charging equipment:** They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are **VERTICALLY INTEGRATED** it really changes the narrative a bit. **AAPL** just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.\n* **Utilization**: from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.\n* **Network of charging stations:**  **BLNK** has it's own cloud based network which will collected *recurring* fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the **AGE OF DATA**? We know that **DATA** is the next oil, that's something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you're nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time. (side note: **PLTR** LEAPS AFTER THE LOCKUP TARDS)\n\n**BLNK Expansion, Growth, Partnerships, Deals, Future revenue streams**\n\n* **BLNK** recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.\n* **BLNK** inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.\n* International expansion. **BLNK** has a deal in Greece with **Nissan** to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric **Nissan**. These people will get access to all of **BLNK**'s network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.\n* **BLNK** announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an *exclusive* deal with Blessing Health System.\n* When **BLNK** signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.\n* **BLNK** received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 - 19.2 kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.\n*  On 28th of July, **BLNK** and **ENS** entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be \u201ceconomically priced\u201d. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.\n* On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless). **TSLA** uses this same tech for it's superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don't care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the \"well I can just charge over night\" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.\n* **VERTICAL INTEGRATION**. Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far **BLNK** can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.\n\n**Some Other Points to Consider**\n\n* Supposedly **BLNK** has the only 80 amp level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it's faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that's what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because **BLNK** chargers have **load-sharing capabilities**. The **BLNK** IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100 amp feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD's, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred amp feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging. **BLNK** envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric. \n* **BLNK**'s pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of **Chargepoint**. For those of you who do not know **Chargepoint** is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by **SBE** and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With **Chargepoint** they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On **BLNK**'s network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that **BLNK** does not have on it's network, because as I've said it does sell equipment as well.\n* **BLNK** has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.\n* **BLNK** does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn't to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.\n* Fleets are coming, **BLNK** seems ready for this.\n* **BLNK** can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking &amp; Services, Commercial &amp; Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food &amp; Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.\n* Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.\n* So you may or may not know that in the USA **TSLA** still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother's boyfriend on top of car companies we've never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.\n* Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.\n\n**The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around**\n\n* **BLNK** seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don't really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV's are really going to be the future. I do.\n* **BLNK**'s owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don't go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before **TSLA** lets be real), doesn't mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don't get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has 6.7 million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.\n* This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think **BLNK** being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.\n* EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don't buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you're also a little bitch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BACK TO SHORT SHORTS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what's not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was 8.8 million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it's no **GME**, I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be amplified the further **BLNK** moves away from it's \"valuation.\" Also with what we've seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are. \n\nSo **BLNK**'s short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was 6.18 million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were 8.8 million. That's about 23%. As of right now it's still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can't see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think **BLNK**'s chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I'd estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.\n\nMonths back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on **BLNK** causing it's share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on **CLSK** some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you'd like to look it up and read the hit piece. **BLNK** managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again? \n\nDid I mention who else hates **BLNK** charging? **SHITRON** himself. Here's a quote from the shitman himself back in November:\n\nShitron said, \"**BLNK**\u2019s valuation makes no sense\" and called the company a \u201ctotal scheme.\u201d Left said it is \u201cinsulting\u201d to call **BLNK** an EV stock.\n\n\u201cNew most ridiculous EV stock is $**BLNK**. No $$ for R&amp;D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues,\u201d Shitron tweeted.\n\nThis goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It's not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.\n\n**I try not to use the** ***F*** **word but here goes a bit of simple** ***Fundamentals*** **for you tards:**\n\nCurrent market cap: **1.85b** Don't need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at **NKLA**. Pretty sure **NKLA** reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.\n\n**BLNK** has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about 2.26 million last quarter. \n\nLast quarter GAAP EPS: -.12\n\nOperating Income: -3.50 M\n\nProfit margin: -285.81% \n\nReturn on Equity: -97.33% This tells you how well they are spending their money. \n\nYes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.\n\nAs a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams \"***SHORT ME!***\" Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nCan we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It's almost like that hasn't been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at **QS**'s 16b dollar market cap and they don't even have a product. **BLNK** at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on **QS,** but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we're printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself **JPOW**). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.\n\nLastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause **BLNK** to quadruple in value. We've seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.\n\nRemember I'm just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I'll let my positions speak for themselves:\n\n**GME** 500 c jan 29 (RIP I TRIED TO IGNITE THE INFINITE GAMMA SQUEEZE GUYS, I DID MY PART AND BOUGHT THAT SHIT ON THURSDAY, GUESSING IF 500C WENT IN THE MONEY IT WAS GOING TO IGNITE A DOMINO EFFECT, I TRIED AND FAILED BUT I LOVE YOU ALL, BUYING MORE SHARES ON MONDAY)\n\n**GME** shares\n\n**PLTR** 30c May 2021\n\n**BB** 14c Jan 2023\n\n**BLNK** 14c Jan 2022\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: **BLNK** is the only vertically integrated EV charging company, **BLNK** has international presence, **BLNK** shares are up 2400% in the past year. It will take .61 days to cover and this number DEFINITELY rising, very small amount of float available, Shitron hates **BLNK**, so do all other short sellers, make no mistake they have put the hit out on **BLNK** and would love to see it run into the ground, **BLNK** is small enough to still rocketship pretty hard, **GME** to the moon.",

Also none of this is financial advise. I have no clue. But I have read a lot of shit that needs some explanation here.\n\nSo lets say we have three guys. Retail Randy (the retard), Billy Blackrock and Marvin Money.\n\nRandy and Billy each own an apple.\n\nMarvin hates apples and think they suck. He borrows Billy's apple and gives him a small fee. Then he sells that apple in an anonymous exchange.\n\nBilly likes apples, and since he has borrowed his apple out, he is buying an apple in an anonymous exchange.\n\nMarvin sees that Billy has another apple, and borrows it again. Sells it again. Billy buys it again another time and Marvin AGAIN borrows and sells it.\n\nThere are only two apples. Randy owns an apple. Marvin is short 3 apples. Billy is long 4 apples.\n\nRandy sees that there are 150% shorts compared to all the apples in existence.\n\nHe say fuck you all, I am setting the price for my apple to a zigillion bucks.\n\nMarvin gets a bit scared and starts buying back apples through the exchange. Billy sees the price go up a bit and sells his apple.\n\nMarvin returns his apple and buys another one from the exchange\n\nBilly sees the price go up a bit and sells his apple etc..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end: Noone ever bought Randys apple. He is a retard.\n\nBilly made a fortune. Randy was a retard\n\nYou have all the right to be a retard.

        "selftext": "I am so tired of this manipulation by all the printed articles, media and their talking heads, Analysis with their bullshit buy and sell signals causing the average person to lose so much money while these big funds just rake it in. I am not taking it anymore ....... Seriously I am fucking done\n\nYesterday I started looking over everything I have sold the last 20 years. NVDA at 120 due to the Citron short, AAPL 90 pre split due to all the sell side analysis saying over extended, over priced, and the list just goes on and on. ISRG which was one of my favorites of all time I sold at 18. Now they limit the amount of shares I can buy in a company. I realize this has been talked about non stop on this sub, but I am going to actually start doing something about it.\n\nStarting on Monday I am going to liquidate my 401k and every other stock I have besides GME (500k). I don't care if this market moons or falls apart, but I want change. Change so these giant funds can't manipulate the market the way they want. Change so that the playing field is leveled and I am not going back until this happens. Maybe if enough people really start to pull out we can finally start sending a real message.\n\nIn regards to GME I like the stock, and going forward I want to buy more.

        "selftext": " \n\n**What? I could still get a 100% return even with a high stock price, how?** There is nothing, absolutely nothing in the entire world that would ever keep GameStop's price at or above the levels they are today in the next 10 years. There was, however, 150% short interest on the float. \n\nLet's simplify this: You have 1 \ud83c\udf4e that you cut into 10 slices. 10 Slices are the outstanding shares. You give 2 \ud83c\udf4e slices to your friends and these become restricted. You go to a Farmer's Market and take your 8 \ud83c\udf4e slices with you to sell. This is the float. \n\nSomeone comes along and thinks \ud83c\udf4e prices will tank, so they want to short the market. They think it will tank so badly they want to short more than the total number of \ud83c\udf4e that are available on the market. Hedge Funds can do this (for now). \n\n**That seems crazy, what does it mean though?** In order to short \ud83c\udf4e a hedge has to \"borrow\" them. They pay interest on this. The longer time it takes for the price of an \ud83c\udf4e to go down, the more interest they have to pay. Also, if the price of \ud83c\udf4e skyrocket, the person who is lending out \ud83c\udf4e might claw them back, forcing the shorter to pay a high price to close out their short. \n\n**So when do I make $10,000 / share and retire?** That's never going to happen...sorry. People are claiming if you set your limit sell order to an absurd number eventually a short has to buy it to cover. Most brokerages will limit the level above the strike you can set a limit. However, there is still a large % of the stock being shorted. It's possible that is several million of those shorts need to close, they would have to buy the stock at a very high price ($312.01 or possibly higher) and this would likely cause the stock to start climbing higher and higher as the shareholders don't want to sell their stock for a low price. \n\n**Why did you say Gamestop was a terrible company**:\n\nGamestop is a terrible company. You literally have to be the biggest idiot in the world to think that Gamestop is worth more money than (throwing out a popular company name that is now smaller in market cap, BEST BUY). I've seen so many bandwagon investors with $5 in their trading account buying a fractional share because \"the GameStop at my mall is always busy\" \n\nAnd? \n\nOther genius ideas I've seen on Reddit: \n\n1. \"GameStop should get into custom pc builds, that would be huge!\"\n2. \"GameStop should do 'paint-n-sip' type parties for gamers, that's a rock-solid business\"\n\nAnyone with these ideas has no idea how a business functions, what a TAM (total addressable market) is, or has ever looked at the GameStop balance sheet from any of the past earnings reports. **GameStop is a dying business, it is Blockbuster, it is Netflix had Netflix kept trying to mail people DvD's instead of streaming.**  \n\nRemember what happened to bc in 2017....that's going to happen with $GME at some point, it's not for certain when or how high the price could go before it comes down, but it will come down. If shorts closing out positions make the price go up, in order to cash out shareholders need to sell those shares. At a certain point, the shorts will be done and shareholders will be selling to others who think the price can keep going. Those people who don't understand anything about the market and just think they're going to make thousands or millions overnight are going to be the ones who end up losing virtually all of their investment if they got to the party late. \n\n**Why can't GameStop be a good company, how do you know anything?**\n\n1. I run a venture capital firm, I invest in companies and am looking at the future outlook of the business, what companies should be valued, will it be worth it to put $$ in them and what is the likelihood I will make money on that investment. \n2. GameStop could turn things around, by doing 1 thing. Going digital. Think about Steam, Stadia, Epic Games....even Apple Arcade on Apple TV. Tech is catching up, everything will be digital. Do you really think that if someone opened up a video game rental store with discs, or a DVD rental store with discs it would become an insanely popular valuable company? No. But nonstop new companies start streaming content...and those do become popular. \n3. Also, take into consideration 5G is here, although not everywhere. 5G is going to enable a lot of people to see significantly higher download speeds than they have even if they have 1gbps with Fios or any other traditional provider, stuff like this is only going to get faster and faster to the point that you literally will be able to stream a game in 4k UHD without even downloading it beforehand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember, just because it's *possible* that the stock could go up due to the short interest, there is no guarantee it does. Don't risk more money than you're willing to lose and don't buy into a lot of the hype you read on Reddit. 99.99% of the people on here now throwing out financial advice don't know anything.   \n\n\nThink about it. If you were so good at investing that you made a fortune...why would you tell other people how to do it? This would limit your ability to continue doing exactly what you do without being arbitraged by others.",

        "selftext": "* The market opened slightly red but quickly reversed because JPow realized this was no way to start a New Year, with Chadsdaq and S&amp;P being propelled to green status thanks to Tim Apple and gang. DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.\n\n* \"I'm totes not dead.\" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.\n\n* The Chinese ADR/ADS sector gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng\n\n* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping, NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89.

ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. \n\n* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings. FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95.\n\n* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you).

        "selftext": "Tl;dr If Apple partners with Hyundai, it will most likely be based on the Canoo base platform. This is purely speculation, but grounded in real facts based on looking at the primary area of collaboration for Hyundai's EV partners, Canoo's founders' history with Apple and Canoo's investor presentation.\n\nLet's dive into the FACTS:\nHyundai is in early talks to develop self-driving electric vehicles with Apple [Link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/hyundai-motor-says-it-is-in-early-talks-with-apple.html). Hyundai also has a couple partnerships to co-develop EVs with Rimac, Arrival and Canoo\n\nFirst take note that in Apple's initial press release, they announced they would be focused on a \"personal, mass-market vehicle rather than a robotaxi or commercial vehicle\" [Link](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35036439/apple-car-2024/)\n\nFor this reason, Canoo is the most likely partner. I'll illustrate using a quote from a press release where it mentions the focus of the Canoo partnership is on small, cost-competitive EVs + PBVs (in other words, mass market vehicles), which is the market Apple is focused on. [Link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia)\n\"Canoo and Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai and Kia\u2019s parent company, will develop a new electric vehicle platform that\u2019s based on the one that powers Canoo\u2019s own vehicle, which was unveiled last year. This EV platform will power small, \u201ccost-competitive\u201d electric vehicles, as well as \u201cpurpose built vehicles,\u201d which would more closely resemble shuttles or even autonomous people-movers.\"\n\nThe reason it is much less likely to be with Arrival or Rimac is based on reading their partnership announcements with Hyundai as well.\n\nFrom Arrival article [Link](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/newsroom/hyundai-and-kia-make-strategic-investment-in-arrival-to-co-develop-electric-commercial-vehicles-0000016387) : \"\u20ac100 million investment enables co-development of eco-friendly vans and other products for logistics, on-demand ride-hailing, and shuttle service companies.\" \nThe target area of the Arrival partnership is on commercial vehicles (delivery vans, shuttles) as opposed to consumer vehicles that Apple will likely target.\n\nFrom Rimac article [Link]( https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2772): \"Hyundai Motor Group and Rimac Automobili (Rimac) have announced a strategic partnership aimed to strengthen the Group\u2019s efforts to lead the high-performance electrified vehicle market and enhance its status as a game changer in Clean Mobility.\"\nThe target area of the Rimac partnership is high performance, sports concept vehicles also unlikely to be Apple's target market. \n\nAnother piece of potential evidence is from Canoo's investor presentation [Link](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_270955872.png). The picture mentions a project in progress with a Tech Strategic who is \"a player in smart car and autonomous vehicle that has identified Canoo as a base platform to integrate systems.\"\n\nThere is also plenty of history behind Apple and the Canoo founders to explain why this speculation is actually fairly reasonable thinking. In 2015, Apple was very close to using the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car [Link](https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-innovation/apple-bmw-i3-electric-car-173344/amp). This deal fell apart, but it shows that Apple was impressed by the BMW i team's EV platform. Fast forward 2 years and Canoo is the creation of those same former BMW i-Execs including Ulrich Kranz (former Head of BMW i) and Richard Kim (former Principal Exterior Designer of i3 production vehicle and i3 and i8 concepts at BMW).",

        "selftext": "Check my post history, I called this before the first breakout and I\u2019m calling it again. AMC is not only next, it has already started. I expressed the market volume fundamentals the first time, but now I\u2019ll explain why we NEED AMC to be next:\n\n1. It is justified. I love the fucking movies and I reject bankruptcy motivated short sellers who will kill the employment of thousands of people. I reject them, I reject them, I reject them.\n\n2. GME NEEDS to be more than an anomaly. If it is our one and only fuck you to the system then it will be forgotten about. If and WHEN it happens to AMC, this becomes a public strategy. \n\n3. The principle behind GME is also an attack on inequality through a rejection of our current manipulative financial system. Short selling is not just 75% bullshit, during a pandemic it\u2019s 150% blood-seeking. Does anyone really believe AMC would be seeking bankruptcy if not for the pandemic? Hedge fund fucks have been warned \u2014 we are COMING for you. \n\n4. ONE \ud83d\ude80 is NOT enough. We have many \ud83e\udd8d and they have mouths to feed. Institutional investors jump from one concept to another; why the fuck can\u2019t we? Why the fuck shouldn\u2019t we? Trick question: these are our rights as investors.\n\n5. Do people not love the movies? I bought into GME for the cause and because GameStop is a business I support. Frankly, I support AMC even more. I continued being an AMC A-Plus Member through the pandemic because I wanted to support the business. Incidentally, I also hold Apple, Disney, Microsoft, etc. Why is it only okay for me to support and rally for the stock market\u2019s top holdings?\n\n6. Robinhood and other trading platforms restricted multiple stocks, AMC among them. My personal earnings have been manipulated as have yours. And if trading platforms and hedge funds are allowed to do this, it will forever disincentive public participation in the markets. I have a Bullseye on EVERY stock that was restricted \u2014 however, AMC had the most momentum and activity outside of GME, it is continuing to rally, and I will continue to breathe life into it. This level of market manipulation CANNOT be allowed. And, to be clear, this also means I effectively have an ETF at the moment of just stocks that I was told I couldn\u2019t buy \u2014 because why? \u2014 fuck that level of bullshit, that\u2019s why. \n\n7. I am tired of money printing and bailouts being used as the only strategy for saving our economy. PRIVATE CAPITAL should also be SOCIAL CAPITAL. The amount of wealth inequality is fucking insane right now. Never in the history of humanity has the concentration of total assets been held by so few hands. The public can\u2019t have a single approach for generating wealth via a transfer back down the chain? Seriously, not even one?\n\nLook, I have so many more reasons. AMC is due to come back when the pandemic resolves, I love getting handjobs at the movies, I enjoy eating popcorn and watching movies with crowds in front of a big fucking screen and\n\nI LIKE THIS STOCK. WE LIKE THIS STOCK. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf7f\ud83d\udd25\n\nThis is a French Revolution of the financial industry, and it is over fucking due. \n\nLONG AMC!!!

Yes the valuation is crazy high, but they continue impress consumers and investors. They used to be mistaken as a software company that wishes they were a car company. Now people confuse them for a car company. They are far and away the worlds leading sustainable energy company and nobody is close behind them. \n\n3 - TTD. Lots of good growth this past year, but tons of runway in the digital streaming ad space. It\u2019s TTD or Google. I like what TTD has to offer. Solid mgmt team.\n\nHonorable mentions.

        "selftext": "Retard TLDR:\n\nBlackBerry IVY is like the browser, it unlocks a shit ton of monetization opportunities. BB 100x by 2030. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nIVY is the upcoming vehicle data platform built by BB with AWS providing the infrastructure.\n\nAccording the McKenzie, potential revenue generated by car data will reach 450-750B by 2030. This was written back in 2016 so I'd say this estimate should be at least 50% higher. Thanks JPOW.\n\nI think by 2030, BB will have this sector BY THE BALLS. BB QNX is already in cars manufactured by TOYOTA, HONDA, GM, FORD, MERCEDES-BENZ, VW GROUP, BMW, HYUNDAI, MASERATI (FCA, Now STELLANTIS), JAGUAR (TATA MOTORS). That's literally ALL of the major car companies in the world. By having an existing business relationship with them BB will take them to bed and make sweet love to them with their IVY dildo.\n\nIf you look at current \"platform\" revenue models from VISA to AAPL, the platform can take in anywhere from 2.5% to 30% of the revenue. Given a 50% market share and 15% revenue share that would be 50B revenue a year for BB. Thats ONLY from cars. They can expand the data platform to other embedded platforms like... anything you fucking want. By 2030 Starbucks' coffee cup's gonna be an embedded system.\n\nRisks:\n\nCar companies are known fuck ups. They fucking suck at everything, even making cars. Hopefully they invest enough to build something meaningful on top of IVY.\n\nPosition: 300 shares, various calls.\n\nBuying more shares on Monday. probably $10-15K total.",

Looking at the cyber security industry, BB outperforms on a number of metrics.  Price to sales is 5.85 vs 11.31 industry.  As well price to book is 3.11 vs industry 11.44, this indicates relative to its industry BB is highly undervalued(Value investors look for P/B ~(0-3), so BB just about fits in there).

        "selftext": "Citadel &amp; Point72 bailed out Melvin Capital which was the GME short selling bagholder, but it does not end here.\n\nThere are other short sellers. And these stocks, not just GME , but others too, became extremely volatile and on giant volume.\n\nSo first there is the issue of liquidated funds that do not have immediate cash.\n\nThey hold positions and would have to unwind them to get cash to cover their margin calls.\n\nMelvin Capital I read was down 30% and got bailed out, so they still have assets, just not liquid, no immediately available cash.\n\nTrust me, if they had a gun to their head they'd have immediately available cash, they'd manage.\n\nSecond, even after what happened in 2007-2009, financial institutions with systemic risk are not THAT capitalized.\n\nIt's not new and never gets solved: in 1987 NYSE specialists had to bed big banks to provide them with more cash or the whole world would collapse.\n\nAnd I think bureaucrats do not understand how this all works very well. No one does honestly. But bureaucrats are really clueless and under or overreact. Always.\n\nIt gets scary for the clearing firms when you have GME making $35 billion volume and going up 400% in 2 days, AMC making $20 billion and gap 300%, higher volumes than Apple and Amazon that are already higher than usual and on 100 times the volatility .\n\nInteractive Broker CEO was the most honest in my eyes and in an interview with CNBC said they halted trading to protect their clients, the clearing houses, the market, and themselves. He said if they had not done it the short squeeze would have kept \"going and going\", so regulators &amp; brokers agreed to stop it all to \"stop the losses\".\n\nRobinhood decided to re-open trading and the CEO pretended he halted trading of the very volatile stocks as routine like \"oh didn't notice anything special was going on\" \ud83e\udd21.\n\nWebull CEO said in an interview their clearing house told them they could not take trades anymore. I think they use another entity than Robinhood does.\n\nNot sure why Robinhood halted buying (and not selling). There's really the need for an investigation here. I can't tell you what happened because we do not know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy 2 cents:\n\nShort sellers are still very strong on this stock, I think they might even have added, I don't know if they are friends with the clearing house but either way they (ch) get stuck in this game, and retail investors are understandably angry at getting blocked like this.\n\nBrokers don't have billions to my knowledge with which they can cover counterparty risk and they have no contractual obligation to do so and I mean they're not santa claus.\n\nMy personal opinion is short sellers refusing to liquidate and take the L is the source of all risks and problems (most of it might be options that they can just hold? Not sure how this gets counted in short interest).\n\nMaybe already the counterparty clearing firms got wiped clean, but regardless of this if the price skyrockets further and the bagholding shorts that refuse to close while they can end up being liquidated and margin called, it's truly over for the market. Everyone is going bankrupt, WSB crashed the world.\n\nThe counterparty providers risk is real, but I am not their accountant, I do not know how bad things are, and we don't know what actors (if any) are of good faith. It could be (it probably is) shorties refusing to take the L, putting the whole market at risk.\n\nI think they are really worried the price gets to 5000. From the Peterffy ( IBKR ) interview they really expected this. And it might still happen.\n\nLehman Brothers, James Cordier, Melvin, same story. They get greedy, they refuse to get out, they get rekt.\n\nAnd sometimes they get an unfair bailout, and are so deluded they actually think they got unlucky when they really messed up.",

        "selftext": " \n\nSo yesterday was a bizarre show perpetrated by brokers and hedge funds with the permission of regulators. There must be consecuences for this. A list of ideas for you to consider (I am not US citizen but I am a GME investor):\n\n1. Robinhood: stop using the App, move to another broker that didn't ban stock trading. If they have no users they cannot IPO. This is how they lose money.\n2. Stop using Google products: I don't live in the US so I can not confirm this one but I saw yesterday that Google deleted Robinhood reviews. Google is part of the cancel culture (I don't know if Apple did the same). Stop using Android and they will lose like half of their revenue. This is how they lose money.\n3. Stop putting money in index funds and start activist investing: BlackRock, Vanguard and the rest of the guys support these hedge funds. Stop paying them comissions, start activist investing (some stocks like Chamath SPACs, etc). This is how they lose money.\n4. Ask for Janet Yellen resignation and 800K USD donation: apparently she received 800K USD from Citadel. Apparently she is not ok with cryptocurrencies because some \"bad actors\" use them, but she is ok with receiving money from hedge funds that are suspect of fraud after what happened yesterday. Let's make her resign and donate her money. This is how politians lose money.\n5. Hold, don't sell: they want you to sell for peanuts so that they can get alive with this. DO NOT SELL. This is how short sellers lose money.\n\nPlease add any ideas you may consider.",

        "selftext": "Ford is doing a phenomenal job at restructuring right now. They have a phenominal new CEO with some Lisa Su level turn around potential.  He is doing everything right.  Cutting garbage unprofitable brands, doing the hype videos and apple/tesla style car releases.  They're focused more on high quality, high margin hype cars than \"lets just produce a bunch of shit\". \n\n They're aiming for a GLOBAL profit margin of 8%.  Sure, they plan on taking a revenue hit, but so far the profits have been growing exponentially and the revenue hasn't been hit very hard.  \n\nRemember, Ford consistently hits 140-150 BILLION in revenue a year.  Currently, they have a 1-2% or abour 3-4 billion in profit a year.  Even if they take a massive hit in revenue, like 25 billion, thats still a minimum of 10 billion dollars profit, and thats only if they don't exceed that.  \n\nThey did something similar after the 2008 crash, and their stock price went 1.80$ a share to nearly 20$ a share.  Remember, just prior to this, they also took a hit from the dotcom bubble crash, when they hit 90$ a share.  \n\nPersonally, I could easily see this stock hitting a minimum or 15$ by 2022 and 20-30$ by 2023. Getting some WSB momentum behind it could easily raise that number quite a bit.  If it picks up some steam, and their CEO keeps doing everything right, then we could easily see 20$ by 2022.  \n\nAlso, no its not a boomer stock anymore.  They got rid of the dividend for now, which means bigger profits and stock gains, they're producing tons of EV cars, apple style hype car releases, and Lisa Su level CEO comeback story.  \n\nPosition: 5375 shares for now.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: My autistic senses say Apple will beat earnings bigly on strong iPhone sales and higher av. selling price. AAPL calls for Jan 29 - March on any strikes above 130 will print\n\nPositions: AAPL 132c 2/5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2pzvjv51gca61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ec55f5d2209e731ffad991bf518f2c1e4fcec1\n\nOver the last two weeks a few reports and FinNews articles have come out expecting strong iPhone sales for Q4 earnings. A strong quarter is expected with the first 5G iPhones and pent up consumer discretionary spending. Any retard could have predicted that but I believe that analyst estimates are low and more importantly is not priced in at $129-133. \n\nA few articles from shills and morons below\n\n[Bezinga: IPHONE 12 SALES ARE 21% BETTER THAN THE IPHONE 11](https://www.gizchina.com/2020/12/29/iphone-12-sales-are-21-better-than-the-iphone-11/)\n\n[Bloomberg: Supply Chain Sends Bullish Signal on 5g After Tepid Start](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/iphone-supply-chain-sends-bullish-signal-on-5g-after-tepid-start)\n\nI did my own due diligence in November and December to figure out how many iPhones they were actually selling. Apple's suppliers posted Q4 [record earnings](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/tsmc-sees-record-breaking-earnings-from-iphone-12-demand) signaling higher production levels than past cycles and analysts report Apple produced 79 million 5g units in Q4 and another 210 million units for FY2021.\n\n Analysts expect a[38% increase](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/22/apples-iphone-12-shipments-set-for-38-annual-growth-in-q1-2021) in units shipped for Q1 2021 and a similar increase for Q4 sales. Additionally the average price of each iPhone sold is expected to be higher than past years (typically around $750.) The model lineup this year is more expensive on average and analysts speculate flagship models iPhone 12, 12 Pro and Max make up the majority of increased sales. \n\nAdditionally sales in Chinese markets are expected to rise Apple market share past the 20% threshold they've been stuck at. \n\nUsing availability data from the Apple website, I found that base iPhone 12 models in any color were sold out (unavailable for in-store pickup) in 80% of Apple stores by the end of December after holiday sales. This isn't an exact count but does suggest that inventories of iPhone 12 models are low even for the commonly purchased base storage models.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/quqwmg5mmda61.png?width=1760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e3607de4af73989b6e35274c26bf82fd1a68dad\n\n Analyst estimates are almost surely correct and may be on the low side if inventories are as low as they look. Additionally the stock has priced in expected lower sales numbers due to a delayed launch date and production holdups. AAPL is still trading below ATH from September when reports came out regarding delayed launches. I believe that Q4 sales will beat significantly  and  since the launch was delayed, demand in Q1 will be greater and guidance for the quarter will be increased during the earnings call. \n\n**Positions**\n\n\\\\We've been sitting at $128-132 for the last two weeks but I have a target price of $142 for post earnings through early March. AAPL is $2.22 trillion behemoth so significant price changes are difficult but the IV on options is low enough (42%) to be worthwhile.\n\n I have already committed the remainder of my options account to this play. I picked up $132c 2/5 on Wednesdays dip but any calls $130+ exp after earnings are a very viable and potentially lucrative play. \n\nIf you buy puts fuck you. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m0piqfflmda61.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc139d7156b79be8e3808451c85b3f45958f3279\n\nOn top of that I just have that autistic little feeling about this play. Felt that way about longing TVIX in February 2018 which was a 10 bagger and Palantir at $9. Being such an autist, I'm not so good with words but I like my numbers and they check out. And lets face it, you've yolo'ed on more retarded DD before.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks give up gains from last week. Lemonade has a wild ride, while NIO shines again. Is JNJ the best vaccine play? Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\n**\\~Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone and Good morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market giving up some of the last week gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/XXF9JHS) losing 1.25%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HGrtWgk) losing 0.66% and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/1z21KR2) finishing down almost 90 points as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/fqwvn71) spiking again by more than 11%, thought it was even higher at the start of the day.\n\nWe saw more companies declining [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/8sr5bqw), but only saw 8 new lows, while the number of companies moving above the moving averages is still very high. We also saw only 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/HgZTxtj) finish the day in the green, with Energy in the lead, while Materials finished flat and Real Estate, Communications and Consumer Discretionary were the biggest losers dropping more than 1% as we saw mostly large-cap growth companies losing ground, with small &amp; mid-caps outperforming yet again, continuing the [TREND](https://ibb.co/8x5m4cc) that can also be seen from the start of 2021.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/m9Jb0sS) from yesterday, you can see almost all big tech companies lost ground, with Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix losing more than 2% while Tesla also lost almost 8% after an 11day winning streak. The biggest gains were made in the semiconductors &amp; drug manufacturers.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/Xp3hvr0) we get don\u2019t get that much economic data, as we wait for more heavy days starting tomorrow.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [LEMONADE](https://ibb.co/K7YV26k) take quite a ride again yesterday, going from barely down for the day, up to a huge gain of 14%, after the COO of the [COMPANY](https://ibb.co/9cCz2XD) went on Twitter and attacked the Seeking Alpha bearish articles on the company, only to later in after hours to announce they will [SELL](https://ibb.co/hYqJJHZ) shares again for corporate purposes. This is further testimony to the point I have been making in the past weeks, that companies are very incentivized to sell stock to raise capital or even for the management of the company to realize some gains. I really like Lemonade and will hold them for the long-term, but after a 200% increase in the past couple of [MONTHS](https://ibb.co/Dp1csg0), I trimmed my positions in the company by selling out the cost basis and letting the profits run, though I might add to this position if a significant pullback or correction appears.\n\nMoving on, we also saw [WALMART](https://ibb.co/pL18LYP) being the latest company that is planning to make a pus in the fintech world. This is really nice news to hear from the company, as they try to diversify their revenue stream even more, while they are also trying to compete more &amp; more with Amazon in the online retail business.\n\nIn the hardware technology [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/b6S6yKn), we saw Apple gaining some market share of the global PC shipments which has seen an overall 13% increase in 2020, the biggest such spike since 2010. I think Apple has room to grow this market share even more with the continuing improvements and adopting of their latest in-house chips.\n\nWe also saw some developments in the health care world, with JNJ\u2019s vaccine [EXPECTED](https://ibb.co/LC4Qsgp) to deliver results by the end of the month, keep in mind this is my favorite vaccine play, with their vaccine only needing 1 shot and not requiring such extreme storage conditions like the Pfizer &amp; Moderna ones, while also being expected to have better results than AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine.\n\nAlso, Eli [Lilly](https://ibb.co/Y8t0gm2) delivered some promising results on their Alzheimer\u2019s study, which led the stock to have a big pop yesterday.\n\nAnd in the IPO world we will have [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/tbdgmjP) Holdings on the deck, as we found out that the fintech Affirm will start its IPO price from at least $41, but it\u2019s really hard to believe shares will reach the market for retail traders under $60-$70.\n\nAnd one last piece of news, exactly like I told you yesterday, [NIO](https://ibb.co/Wv8nRpy) opened higher on the huge hype after the NIO Day, almost touching 67$ before dropping to under 63$ to finish the day, only to [DROP](https://ibb.co/dpzHh7Q) even more after hours, before recovering today in pre-market. It\u2019s a wild ride with this company. I see some short-term downside, but long-term upside for this company.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as I think there is a significant possibility that with this new stimulus checks, we might see another increase in stock trading from people who are receiving these checks. Last [TIME](https://ibb.co/sFWcyRp) around securities trading was one of the top ways that money was used in most of the income brackets. Today the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/FBxg7s8) Markets are pretty flat and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/s22g9Pb) are mixed, with the Dow slightly down, while the Nasdaq is leading the way.\n\n \ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "**DO NOT LISTEN TO PEOPLE SAYING NOK HYPE ARE BOTS. THESE ARE FUDDERS TRYING TO GET IN CHEAPER OR EXIT POSITIONS. THE HYPE IS REAL**\n\nNokia is now a market leader in networking and enterprise level technology, essentially providing infrastructure for all types of networks. They also manufacture telecommunications equipment and engage in licensing. The most exciting opportunity in their current business model is 5G, which could be the main catalyst for this seemingly boring stock to finally break through resistance and become a valuable asset in portfolios. I'll give some key updates and price targets below.\u00a0\n\n\nPartnerships and beneficiary of 5G rollouts\n\n\nFor starters, it's been a common thesis that 5G will be the greatest investing opportunity of the decade, yet Nokia remains in a flat/downward pattern on the chart. They've recently earned several contracts that will give them a stronger moat in the 5G domain as well as steady revenues and growth opportunities. Recent contracts come from a very diverse group of partners, including:\u00a0\n\n-A 5 year deal with T-Mobile, in which T-Mobile will power it's 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum using Nokia's AirScale Radio platform. In addition, Nokia will facilitate T-Mobile to upgrade it's mid-band LTE network to a 5G network.\u00a0\n\n-Secured a government contract via the\u00a0National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence. Nokia was selected as the tech provider and collaborator for the 5G Cybersecurity Project. The federal agency plans to utilize Nokia's technology for the transition to 5G from 4G. The project intends to identify 5G use cases to highlight the efficacy of the components of 5G architecture against security threats as part of a government initiative to beef up it's cyber security and anti-spying tools.\n\n-Partnership with Google Cloud\u00a0in which the 2 firms will work in unison on businesses' digital transformation at the network edge through both 5G connectivity and cloud-native applications and capabilities. The partnership's purpose is to develop solutions for communication service providers to modernize network infrastructure and ensure smooth transitions to cloud-native 5G-core. This will likely build an ecosystem of services that deployable anywhere, from network edge, to public clouds, private clouds, and carrier networks.\u00a0\n\n-Nokia has also recently announced\u00a0partnerships with M1\u00a0for 5G solutions in Singarpore, as well as\u00a0TeleZ\u00a0to deploy key infrastructure solutions for TeleZ subsribers in Sweden, Lativa, Lithuania, and Estonia. They were also awarded a contract by NASA for $14.1 million to build 4G infrastructure on the moon.\u00a0\n\n\nNokia has more than 220 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which at least 30 have deployed 5G. They were also in a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. expressed interest in owning a piece of the company, and in response Finland built it's stake in Nokia via Solidium Oy, the state's equity-asset manager, to 1 billion euros($1.2b usd). Nokia also intends to repurchase 500 million shares in the coming months, so demand for the stock is picking up on all levels.\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to infrastructure, licensing is a huge part of Nokia's business model that will benefit from 5G. The \"Nokia Technologies\" Arm handles patent licensing, technology licensing, and brand licensing. This includes an industry-leading patent portfolio including ~20,000 patent families including ~3500 5G standard essential patent families.\u00a0\n\n\nSo why is a company with so many valuable assets and recently announced deals/partnerships still trading flat and so seemingly undervalued? The short answer is the former CEO made several bad choices which gave Nokia's competitors an upper hand on the current 5G landscape and put NOK share price in a long term downtrend which has gave it a reputation as a boring stock with an ugly chart. However, with new CEO Pekka Lundmark's expertise in driving returns to shareholders, as well as the scrutiny and subsequent bans of Huawei opening the door for competition, Nokia now has a much needed breath of life and a chance to gain market share to become the biggest beneficiary of the 5G revolution. The new CEO is determined to get Nokia to the top and pull in solid returns to shareholders, as evidenced by the slew of recent contracts/partnerships along with his plans for spending aggressively on R&amp;D, as well as developing a leaner business model by cutting unnecessary expenses and unprofitable endeavors.\u00a0\n\n\nNokia is primed for growth as they plan into several emerging, high growth markets including 5G, IoT, Edge computing, Network Encryption, Cloud Radio Access, Software Defined Infrastructure(SDI), Cloud Managed LAN, Optical Communications and Networking, as well as established high growth markets such as Smart Wearables, Defense/Security, and LTE.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDespite the slew of positive news surrounding Nokia and their partnerships/contracts, the stock is still very undervalued, even at today's price surge. \n\nThat may soon change, as the stock's chart is beginning to signal incoming volatility. The implied volatility(IV) and volume for NOK call options are indicating big moves in the coming months. Open interest is on the rise as well.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNOK is trading at a\u00a0Price/Book ratio\u00a0of\u00a01.3x, compared to it's peers average of\u00a04.0x\u00a0and the sector average\u00a02.2x\u00a0\n\nNOK is also undervalued in terms of\u00a0Price/LTM sales. It has a ratio of\u00a00.9x, it's peers trade at an average of\u00a03.9x, and the sector average of\u00a01.8x\n\nTo establish the Fair Value Estimate, we'll use 2 models taking input from previous NOK financials, as well as data from competitors. (Competitors include: CSCO, ERIC, MSI, MSFT, and AAPL.\n\nP/E Multiples:\u00a0$14.94\u00a0target\u00a0\n\nEarnings Power Value:\u00a0$15.64\u00a0target\u00a0\n\nThe average for the 2 models imply a\u00a0Fair Value Estimate\u00a0of\u00a0$15.29 \n\n\n\n\nThese estimates are based on historical data, therefore are fair values for the current price and past performance, not taking into account the market share and recurring revenue recently secured. I believe over the 3 months ad beyond the fair value will be much higher as earnings begin to reflect the value and growth from 5G contracts and recurring revenues.\u00a0\n\n\nEven currently, those estimates are a bit low as Nokia's closest competitor, Ericsson, has a market cap that is nearly 70% higher than Nokia, despite the two having very similar financials and even trailing Nokia in several key metrics.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAt NOK's current share price of, it remains undervalued as ERIC is only ahead of NOK in 2 key categories, EBITDA and Profit Margin, and ERIC is only outperforming NOK by a slim margin in these categories. I believe NOK should be valued much higher, than ERIC since they are gaining contracts MUCH faster than ERIC and also Huawei, which would imply a share price of\u00a0$7.11\u00a0before any buybacks place shares into the treasury, which would increase the price even further.\u00a0\n\n\nNokias Fair value is over $25\n\nThis is based on competitor ERIC who is valued 68.4% higher despite having trailing NOK in almost every key metric for valuation, and the valuation of Huawei who is losing tons of revenue and contracts in favor of Nokia",

Some big names that they have include, **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX.\n\n**Software**\n\nBlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html).

        "selftext": "**Background**\n\nCD PROJEKT S.A. (WSE: CDR) is a Polish video game developer, publisher and distributor based in Warsaw. CD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series and the recent release of Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nThe CD PROJEKT Group currently conducts operating activities in two key segments: CD PROJEKT RED and GOG.com (originally as Good Old Games).\n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nCD PROJEKT Capital Group is headed by CD PROJEKT S.A. A holding company which has five subsidiaries.\n\nThe subsidiaries are:\n\n\\- GOG sp. z o.o (Similar to Steam, it is a distributor of games).\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Inc (Where all the game development happens)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Co. Ltd (Only for selling games in China)\n\n\\- Spokko sp. z o.o. (The mobile arm of CD projekt red)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT RED STORE sp. z o.o. (A new store of merchandise launched by the company)\n\n**GOG -** Who have just released a 2.0 version called GOG Galaxy which subsequently entered its beta testing phase. The goal of the application is to enable players to integrate all their game shelves into a single library, to communicate with friends and to track their progress regardless of their preferred gaming platforms. Its functionality will span PC and console platforms, extending beyond the GOG.com user base. It's main selling points are that is uses the cloud, is DRM free and has a ton of old games such as Diablo, Destroy all humans etc on it's platform that Steam doesn't.\n\nSteam is the single biggest distributor of digital games for PC, it's been dominating the market for years and has way more games than GOG does due to this. Especially as a lot of publishers do not want to host their games DRM free which GOG requires. It's very difficult to predict the future of GOG because Steam is a private company so we don't have access to it's numbers.\n\nHowever the big benefit of GOG is that CD Projekt Red can sell and promote it's games directly through their own platform. The benefit being a much bigger margin on each game sold as 100% of the profit goes to CD Projekt red if a game is sold on GOG, whereas on Steam they take a 20% cut for the first $50m revenue of Cyberpunk. **One third** of all digital PC preorders for Cyberpunk 2077 sales were on GOG which is an incredible achievement by CD Projekt Red considering Steams dominance.\n\nThis is probably the reason why CD Projekt Red has such a huge operating margin from 30% to 50% in recent years. They are involved in the entire process of making and selling their games.\n\n***GWENT: The Witcher Card Game*** is the first multiplayer game developed by the CD PROJEKT Group. It has been a hugely successful and highly rated game (which is impressive considering it's their first mobile multiplayer game). The reason why this game is important for the future is because multiplayer is the key to the cash machine which is microtransactions which the card game has.\n\n**Cyberpunk** was released recently and had been in development for many years. It's sold very well but less than analysts expectations and there has been serious problems on console versions which led to sony removing cyberpunk 2077 from it's PS store for the time being. This caused the companies stock to plummet 37% recently.\n\nI'll get into the numbers at the bottom for my reverse DCF that I did.\n\n**Cyberpunk Online** multiplayer will definitely come at some point within the next couple of years. The reason being is that after GTA Onlines unbelievable success and constant revenue generation for Take Two then it makes sense to try and replicate this with Cyberpunk. This multiplayer will feature microtransactions and in my opinion is the way Cd Projekt red can really make the big $$ in the future. Microtransactions for cosmetic items like in game skins or packs (like fifa) are easy to implement and have huge operating margins as they take 0 CAPEX and virtually no time to implement due to being some simple code and designs. Here's a quote taken from their 2019 Annual Report for *Key Sources Of Revenue*:\n\n&gt;\u25a0 sales carried out through optional microtransactions in GWENT: The Witcher Card Game (incl. kegs and meteorite dust) via GOG, proprietors of console platforms (PlayStation, Xbox) and App Store (Apple)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are some huge risks with cd projekt red, here are the main ones:\n\n\\- Neither IP, The Wither or Cyberpunk 2077 is owned by CD Projekt since the two series are based on a series of novels and a tabletop RPG respectively. So they would need permission from these license holders (the creators I think) to be able to do other spin offs for them. While it is likely the permission will be given due to the huge successes it's not a certainty.\n\n\\- CD Projekt Red relies on a couple of block busters to make 80% of their revenue and earnings. The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the only revenue generates the company has (apart from GOG). If CD Projekt red messes up either of these huge IP's in the future (or like they just have with the console versions of Cyberpunk) then you can expect a huge and sudden stock price drop and potential damage to the company.\n\n\\- Because of the few but huge releases, CD Projekt Red has very volatile earnings and revenue making it very hard to predict, similar to Take Two Interactive. You can see in the following picture how sales drop a lot after release.\n\n**Co-Founders and Board History**\n\nCD PROJEKT has a very long tenure of the management board, all at least 10 years and 3/5 of them 20+ years. Insiders have a significant stake in CD Projekt red's stock, including the joint CEO's. This is great news for shareholders as the insiders have a big incentive to make the company work as they have big stakes in the company.\n\nCompany shareholding structure is made up of the following people:\n\n\\- **Marcin Iwinski** (Joint CEO &amp; Co-Founder) is **13%**\n\n\\- **Michal Kicinski** (Ex Joint CEO &amp; Co-Founder) is **11%**\n\n\\- **Piotr Nielubowicz** (VP, CFO) is **6%**\n\n\\- **Adam Kicinski** (President &amp; Joint CEO) is **3%**\n\nIncentives for management:\n\n&gt;Management goals are based 80% on net earnings and 20% on SP over the WIG index.\n\nThese are poor goals in my opinion. Net earnings can be enhanced by poor acquisitions and stock price is meaningless and should be ignored in incentives as it can produce short term motivations.\n\nManagement hit the majority of their goals for year 2019.Their goals going forward:\n\n&gt;Goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 8,300 PLN or 1,660 PLN a year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Optimistic goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 10,000 PLN or 2,000 PLN a year.\n\nThese goals seem too high in my opinion. Especially after their cyberpunk flop on consoles but it's still possible.\n\n**Competitors**\n\nCD PROJEKT is well known for its biggest sales on The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 hype. However, there\u2019s a lot of gaming industries that compete with one another.\n\nThus comparing its competitors such as Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts (EA), Activision Blizzard has more diversified games and games produced more frequently compared to CD PROJEKT RED.\n\nCD Projekt Red's risk in terms of competitors is releasing a big game that clashes with another big game such as GTA 6. However all gaming companies have a good tailwind right now due to COVID restrictions and microtransactions are lifting all gaming companies margins. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n**Industry**\n\n&gt;**-** CAGR 2019-2024 Video games and e-sports growth expected to be 7% (source: PWC Global Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook 2020\u20132024).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- In 2019 the strongest strong growth was observed in the mobile and console segments. The former grew by 9.7%, reaching 68.2 billion USD, while the latter grew by 7.3%, reaching 45.3billion USD. The PC market reached a volume of 35.3 billion USD, having increased by 2.8%.The largest share of the global videogame market is currently held by mobile devices (46%), 80% of which are smartphone releases. Gaming consoles come in second at 30%, followed by the PC 24%. Mobile devices are projected to retain their top position, with their corresponding market volume increasing by 11.2% annually (on average) over the next three years. According to estimates, the volume of the global mobile game market will reach 93.6 billion USD by 2022 (it currently stands at 68.2 billion USD).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can see from the above as to why CD projekt red is branching out to smartphones and China.\n\n**Reverse DCF**  \n\n\nHere's the original post and reverse DCF because r/stocks does not allow images: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr\\_cd\\_projekt\\_red\\_analysis\\_is\\_it\\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr_cd_projekt_red_analysis_is_it_undervalued/)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt's been extremely difficult to project CD Projekt Red and even after doing research I am still very unsure on a bunch of variables. In my opinion the markets assumptions of CD Projekt Red's growth and margins as shown above in the reverse DCF is perfectly acceptable to me. Therefore I would not buy their shares unless they dipped to around 210 zloty\\~ as I don't think they are undervalued yet. given the risks.\n\nPlease comment if you see anything wrong with my valuation. This was a very difficult one for me.\n\nThanks",

        "selftext": "* The market opened slightly red but quickly reversed because JPow realized this was no way to start a New Year, with Chadsdaq and S&amp;P being propelled to green status thanks to Tim Apple and gang. DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.\n\n* \"I'm totes not dead.\" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.\n\n* The Chinese ADR/ADS sector gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng\n\n* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping, NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings this Thursday after market close.\n\n* GM pop 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. \n\n* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings. FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95.\n\n* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63. Steel prices continues to rip and earnings will be early next month on Feb 11th.\n\n* The DOW closed up 167 pts to 0.55%, Nasdaq up 120 pts to 0.95%, S&amp;P up 26 pts to 0.71%, and RUT closed up 33 pts to 1.71%. Notable numbers tomorrow: ADP employment report at 8:15 AM ET, factory orders at 10 AM ET, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and FOMC minutes at 2PM ET. \n\n(Yesterday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqi8e8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_and_recent_market_driving/)).",

        "selftext": "(*Editor's note: It's a wild day for the market and the country, and I will try to be as neutral as possible despite the fuckery afoot)*.\n\n* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. \n\n* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.\n\n* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.\n\n* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).\n\n* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.\n\n* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.\n\n* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.\n\n* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):\n\n    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. \n\n    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. \n\n    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.\n\n* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&amp;P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).\n\n(Yesterday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr7ze8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_market_driving_news_jan_5/)).",

        "selftext": "**Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot &amp; Industrial stocks? Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn\u2019t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.\n\nYesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.\n\nYesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.\n\nIn some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.\n\nWhile in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business. \n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them. \n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market! \n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them.\n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**What is the impact of the Georgia Election on the Stock market? Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities &amp; Real Estate just finished in the red.\n\nMost small &amp; mid-cap value &amp; core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil&amp; Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.\n\nThe economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.\n\nWe also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index &amp; supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).\n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.\n\nIf the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it\u2019s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big &amp; important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn\u2019t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any \u201cbig tax changes\u201d or any other \u201cbig regulation changes\u201d. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn\u2019t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay &amp; WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don\u2019t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.\n\nYesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN\u2019s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.\n\nMeanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more &amp; more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development &amp; future outlook for the company before. I think both GM &amp; Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling &amp; portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot &amp; Industrial stocks? Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn\u2019t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.\n\nYesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.\n\nYesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.\n\nIn some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.\n\nWhile in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business. \n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Thursday. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 7th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-7-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday\u2019s record despite Capitol turmoil\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high despite the turmoil at the Capitol. Early Thursday, outgoing President Donald Trump said in a statement there \u201cwill be an orderly transition\u201d of power, shortly after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win.\n\n&gt; * Economists expect an increase in initial jobless claims, when the Labor Department reports its weekly numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. With the seven-day average of new daily U.S. Covid infections spiking to a record high, first-time filings for unemployment benefits are seen rising by 28,000 to 815,000 for the week ended Jan. 2.\n\n&gt; * Ahead of Friday\u2019s government employment report, the ADP\u2019s look at December jobs trends at U.S. companies showed a contraction in private-sector positions for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus. Throughout most of the pandemic, the ADP estimates have been below the final government count.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. 10-year Treasury yield above 1%; bitcoin above $38,000\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% on Thursday morning after projected wins for Democrats in both Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.\n\n&gt; * The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president\n\n&gt; * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump\u2019s statement, which promised \u201can orderly transition on January 20th,\u201d the day of Biden\u2019s inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.\n\n&gt; * Congress\u2019 process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to \u2018seriously consider\u2019 invoking 25th Amendment\n\n&gt; * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to \u201cseriously consider\u201d invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.\n\n&gt; * Members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.\n\n&gt; * An administration official confirmed to CNBC\u2019s Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.\n\n&gt; * Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate\n\n&gt; * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock\u2019s projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden\u2019s inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/9XpUya2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/b1ONrMj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hlGMHJY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/MwtIp40.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/woHTGtU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/p2hDbTv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8U9WkLG.png)**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DCDo1wn.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ll8cCTt.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/YsUcUXl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/CP3wwyi.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/AASY8MJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/d1UpWE6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gJR7CZH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-bed-bath-beyond-walgreens-curevac-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)** \u2013 The housewares retailer reported quarterly profit of 8 cents per share, short of the 19 cents a share consensus estimate.

        "selftext": "**What is the impact of the Georgia Election on the Stock market? Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities &amp; Real Estate just finished in the red.\n\nMost small &amp; mid-cap value &amp; core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil&amp; Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.\n\nThe economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.\n\nWe also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index &amp; supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).\n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.\n\nIf the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it\u2019s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big &amp; important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn\u2019t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any \u201cbig tax changes\u201d or any other \u201cbig regulation changes\u201d. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn\u2019t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay &amp; WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don\u2019t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.\n\nYesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN\u2019s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.\n\nMeanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more &amp; more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development &amp; future outlook for the company before. I think both GM &amp; Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling &amp; portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot &amp; Industrial stocks? Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn\u2019t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.\n\nYesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.\n\nYesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.\n\nIn some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.\n\nWhile in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business. \n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them. \n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 7th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-7-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday\u2019s record despite Capitol turmoil\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high despite the turmoil at the Capitol. Early Thursday, outgoing President Donald Trump said in a statement there \u201cwill be an orderly transition\u201d of power, shortly after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win.\n\n&gt; * Economists expect an increase in initial jobless claims, when the Labor Department reports its weekly numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. With the seven-day average of new daily U.S. Covid infections spiking to a record high, first-time filings for unemployment benefits are seen rising by 28,000 to 815,000 for the week ended Jan. 2.\n\n&gt; * Ahead of Friday\u2019s government employment report, the ADP\u2019s look at December jobs trends at U.S. companies showed a contraction in private-sector positions for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus. Throughout most of the pandemic, the ADP estimates have been below the final government count.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. 10-year Treasury yield above 1%; bitcoin above $38,000\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% on Thursday morning after projected wins for Democrats in both Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.\n\n&gt; * The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president\n\n&gt; * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump\u2019s statement, which promised \u201can orderly transition on January 20th,\u201d the day of Biden\u2019s inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.\n\n&gt; * Congress\u2019 process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to \u2018seriously consider\u2019 invoking 25th Amendment\n\n&gt; * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to \u201cseriously consider\u201d invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.\n\n&gt; * Members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.\n\n&gt; * An administration official confirmed to CNBC\u2019s Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.\n\n&gt; * Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate\n\n&gt; * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock\u2019s projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden\u2019s inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/9XpUya2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/b1ONrMj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hlGMHJY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/MwtIp40.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/woHTGtU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/p2hDbTv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8U9WkLG.png)**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DCDo1wn.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ll8cCTt.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/YsUcUXl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/CP3wwyi.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/AASY8MJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/d1UpWE6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gJR7CZH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-bed-bath-beyond-walgreens-curevac-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)** \u2013 The housewares retailer reported quarterly profit of 8 cents per share, short of the 19 cents a share consensus estimate.

        "selftext": "**What is the impact of the Georgia Election on the Stock market? Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities &amp; Real Estate just finished in the red.\n\nMost small &amp; mid-cap value &amp; core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil&amp; Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.\n\nThe economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.\n\nWe also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index &amp; supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).\n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.\n\nIf the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it\u2019s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big &amp; important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn\u2019t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any \u201cbig tax changes\u201d or any other \u201cbig regulation changes\u201d. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn\u2019t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay &amp; WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don\u2019t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.\n\nYesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN\u2019s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.\n\nMeanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more &amp; more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development &amp; future outlook for the company before. I think both GM &amp; Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling &amp; portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#(**[CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL SOURCE!](https://www.stockaholics.net/threads/todays-pre-market-movers-news-thursday-january-7th-2021.11342/)**)\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 7th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-7-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday\u2019s record despite Capitol turmoil\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high despite the turmoil at the Capitol. Early Thursday, outgoing President Donald Trump said in a statement there \u201cwill be an orderly transition\u201d of power, shortly after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win.\n\n&gt; * Economists expect an increase in initial jobless claims, when the Labor Department reports its weekly numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. With the seven-day average of new daily U.S. Covid infections spiking to a record high, first-time filings for unemployment benefits are seen rising by 28,000 to 815,000 for the week ended Jan. 2.\n\n&gt; * Ahead of Friday\u2019s government employment report, the ADP\u2019s look at December jobs trends at U.S. companies showed a contraction in private-sector positions for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus. Throughout most of the pandemic, the ADP estimates have been below the final government count.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. 10-year Treasury yield above 1%; bitcoin above $38,000\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% on Thursday morning after projected wins for Democrats in both Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.\n\n&gt; * The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president\n\n&gt; * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump\u2019s statement, which promised \u201can orderly transition on January 20th,\u201d the day of Biden\u2019s inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.\n\n&gt; * Congress\u2019 process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to \u2018seriously consider\u2019 invoking 25th Amendment\n\n&gt; * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to \u201cseriously consider\u201d invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.\n\n&gt; * Members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.\n\n&gt; * An administration official confirmed to CNBC\u2019s Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.\n\n&gt; * Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.\n\n*****\n\n&gt;  # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate\n\n&gt; * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock\u2019s projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden\u2019s inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/9XpUya2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/b1ONrMj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hlGMHJY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/MwtIp40.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/woHTGtU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/p2hDbTv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8U9WkLG.png)**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DCDo1wn.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ll8cCTt.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/YsUcUXl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/CP3wwyi.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/AASY8MJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/d1UpWE6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gJR7CZH.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* PLUG\n* TWTR\n* BBBY\n* SUNW\n* CBAT\n* WBA\n* CVAC\n* NCTY\n* DNT.X\n* FCEL\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-bed-bath-beyond-walgreens-curevac-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)** \u2013 The housewares retailer reported quarterly profit of 8 cents per share, short of the 19 cents a share consensus estimate.

Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.\n\n&gt; * The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president\n\n&gt; * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump\u2019s statement, which promised \u201can orderly transition on January 20th,\u201d the day of Biden\u2019s inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.\n\n&gt; * Congress\u2019 process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to \u2018seriously consider\u2019 invoking 25th Amendment\n\n&gt; * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to \u201cseriously consider\u201d invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.\n\n&gt; * Members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.\n\n&gt; * An administration official confirmed to CNBC\u2019s Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.\n\n&gt; * Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate\n\n&gt; * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock\u2019s projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden\u2019s inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/9XpUya2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/b1ONrMj.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hlGMHJY.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/MwtIp40.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/woHTGtU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/p2hDbTv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8U9WkLG.png)**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DCDo1wn.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ll8cCTt.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/YsUcUXl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/CP3wwyi.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/AASY8MJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/d1UpWE6.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gJR7CZH.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* PLUG\n* TWTR\n* BBBY\n* SUNW\n* CBAT\n* WBA\n* CVAC\n* NCTY\n* DNT.X\n* FCEL\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-bed-bath-beyond-walgreens-curevac-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)** \u2013 The housewares retailer reported quarterly profit of 8 cents per share, short of the 19 cents a share consensus estimate.

Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.\n\n* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.\n\n* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).\n\n* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.\n\n* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.\n\n* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.\n\n* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):\n\n    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. \n\n    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. \n\n    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.\n\n* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&amp;P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).\n\n(Yesterday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr7ze8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_market_driving_news_jan_5/)).",

Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn\u2019t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.\n\nYesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.\n\nYesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.\n\nIn some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.\n\nWhile in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business. \n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them. \n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**What is the impact of the Georgia Election on the Stock market? Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities &amp; Real Estate just finished in the red.\n\nMost small &amp; mid-cap value &amp; core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil&amp; Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.\n\nThe economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.\n\nWe also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index &amp; supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).\n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.\n\nIf the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it\u2019s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big &amp; important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn\u2019t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any \u201cbig tax changes\u201d or any other \u201cbig regulation changes\u201d. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn\u2019t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay &amp; WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don\u2019t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.\n\nYesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN\u2019s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.\n\nMeanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more &amp; more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development &amp; future outlook for the company before. I think both GM &amp; Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling &amp; portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn\u2019t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.\n\nYesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.\n\nYesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.\n\nIn some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.\n\nWhile in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business. \n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them. \n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**What is the impact of the Georgia Election on the Stock market? Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020, let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities &amp; Real Estate just finished in the red.\n\nMost small &amp; mid-cap value &amp; core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil&amp; Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.\n\nThe economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.\n\nWe also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index &amp; supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).\n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.\n\nIf the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it\u2019s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big &amp; important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn\u2019t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any \u201cbig tax changes\u201d or any other \u201cbig regulation changes\u201d. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn\u2019t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay &amp; WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes.

This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).\n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.\n\nIf the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it\u2019s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big &amp; important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn\u2019t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any \u201cbig tax changes\u201d or any other \u201cbig regulation changes\u201d. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn\u2019t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay &amp; WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don\u2019t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.\n\nYesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN\u2019s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.\n\nMeanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more &amp; more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development &amp; future outlook for the company before. I think both GM &amp; Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling &amp; portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "I'm in tech and I have good news if you like money. Shorting Intel is too obvious I don't know. why options are so cheap to buy. \n\n**Why Intel is doomed**\n\nIntel have missed their own deadlines for delivering newer manufacturing methods and their CPUs are falling behind AMD in terms of cost and performance for a while. That is not the news. The stock is already hit by AMD performance. Intel is doomed because our industry is moving to Arm. Arm processors are performing way better at a fraction of cost. See [this report](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd/9) if you're not convinced. What I'm seeing in the industry is that a lot of cloud computing customers are finding it super easy to switch to Arm. Developer computers are mostly Macs and the M1 Macs are just the tip of the iceberg on what's going to happen. Once developers can easily develop on Arm machines, they most likely will deploy their code to an Arm cloud server. Amazon's AWS Graviton is performing well enough to switch. \n\n**Microsoft will kill Intel** \n\nApple is doing their part with M1 and Amazon is balls deep with their Arm chips but what makes a huge difference is Microsoft's energy for fucking intel in the ass by making Windows Arm friendly and pulling a fast one on Intel by developing their own chips. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAmazon, Apple and Microsoft are going to gang bang Intel's wife.

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

        "selftext": "In early Q1 P-C-P-L is merging with E2open. E2open has disruptive AI / Cloud technology for the supply-chain industry. They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.\n\nWhat differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.\n\nE2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.\n\nE2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.\n\nIn the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. \n\nI'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.\n\nEven if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.\n\nInstitutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers. \n\nMy PT pre-merge is 15 and 25 EOY assuming their projected 10% revenue growth. If E2open surpasses 2021 expected revenue as I'm suspecting and they have major quarterly beats, I'm holding until 50.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my largest position. I'm in 2500 shares at 10.87.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

        "selftext": "# The Metric\n\nI recently had an idea for a metric to be used to find hot stocks. I call the metric \"Price Elasticity\" and it is comprised of two numbers: upturn elasticity and downturn elasticity.\n\n* Upturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market up days\n* Downturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market down days\n\nUsing these numbers and a few additional basic requirements (like positive EPS and at least 31 days of trading history), my screener found 99 stocks out of about 5700 searched that have good to exceptional price elasticities. (the list of these stocks is linked below and also [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing))\n\n# What makes for good price elasticity numbers?\n\nI made two classifications for stocks with good price elasticity data.\n\n1. **Irrational** \\- Upturn elasticity &gt; 1, Downturn elasticity &lt; 0\n2. **Responsible** \\- Upturn elasticity &gt; 1, 0 &lt; Downturn elasticity &lt; 1\n\nWith any stock I want an upturn elasticity &gt; 1, meaning that the stock tends to move higher than the market when the market goes up. The \"Irrational\" classification gets its name because if a stock's downturn elasticity is negative this means the stock, on average, moves up when the market goes down. So a stock that moves higher than the market when the market goes up and also moves up when the market goes down is classified as \"Irrational\". These stocks tend to have less trading history and are very volatile.\n\nThen there are \"Responsible\" stocks which like Irrational stocks move higher than the market when the market goes up. Unlike Irrational stocks though, Responsible stocks move lower when the market moves lower. The reason I still consider them good is because their downturn elasticity is &lt;1 and &gt;0, meaning that, while they do move down with the market, they move down to a lesser degree.\n\nSome popular stocks picked up by the screener include: AMD, ADSK, ETSY, NFLX, NVDA, SHOP and TSLA. Many of the other stocks have lower market caps and could be interesting value / growth plays given they too made the cut.\n\n# Link to the 99 stocks found:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea if there is merit to my Price Elasticity metric (or if it has already been \"invented\") but it was a fun project and the screener found some interesting stocks I would have never discovered otherwise. The validity of the metric is entirely based on the assumption that past trends indicate future performance, and for those looking to beat the market the trends of these 99 stocks should be very appealing. I made the screener using Python3 and TD Ameritrade's API. Of the stocks in that list I am currently holding AMD, CAMT, EPAM, and NLOK.",

        "selftext": "**Lots of opportunities this week, across the market. Though pennies are easier to trade than large caps at the moment (for us retail traders), I suspect a variety of pennies will start to pullback within the next month, as hedgefunds rotate out of them before Spring.**  \n\n\n\\------\n\n$OSS - $4 is the clear support here right now. This chart is almost robotic. Algos/MMs account for the majority of the volume. I think a move to $5 is completely possible as long as Monday/Tuesday open strong. There has been no interest in buying above $4, so that's why I am waiting to see.    \n\n\n$AZRX - low float, large unexplained bids in after hours to end the week. Can move rapidly. Keep your eye on it.     \n\n\n$FRSX - Not interested in buying until I see it stabilize at a new level. Probably $4. I only look to buy after a stock has finished pulling back. I am not aware of any upcoming PR, but I do know that more eyes have been alerted to FRSXs' existence.   \n\n\n$BFT - $15 support could be inviting to a lot of retail traders. I expect a battle.   \n\n\n$DGLY - u/imatoybutitscool pointed out to me that the DGLY is bouncing off the 200-day MA. If there was a large green candle to open above the 20day SMA, that could indicate a confirmed reversal (for however long it would last). $DGLY and a few other riot stocks could get hot, given news of political unrest.  \n\n\n$AMD - Watchlist for another spike. ($95c, 1/15/21 would be my pick) If no bad news comes out, I see a potential move from $91 to $95. $AMD is relatively simple to trade using basic indicators such as the: 20SMA + 10day EMA + 10day RSI)   \n\n\n$PLTR and $GME - Yes, I know these are r/WSB children, meaning they are likely terrible ideas, and hedgefunds are trying to short them. $GME is a no-go from me. Tracking the short interest is scary, because the short volume can reach as high as 30%, and the covering barely bumps the stock back up. I would not touch this right now. Not worth the mental distress. $PLTR - The selling volume exceeds the buying volume. However I do think both of these tickers are important to follow, because they could get big intra-day pumps due to being so popular.   \n\n\n$MARA /$RIOT - Play off of Bitcoin. I personally don't trade crypto, but you can definitely use these two tickers to your advantages during times of bitcoin bullishness.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market.

        "selftext": " About five years ago a friend of mine recommended the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham. The strategy outlined within really resonated with me. I spent my twenties as wandering acetic of sorts, and I never imagined myself playing the stock market, because it seemed like the kind of endeavor reserved for guys who snort blow off of hooker\u2019s tits in the back of lambos. Value investing, on the other hand, seemed to really fit my persona. I mean I\u2019m the kind of guy who will argue with the green grocer for hours just to get a 10-cent discount on some shriveled turnip, so I figured I might actually have a knack for sniffing out bargains in the equity markets as well. I became more and more eager to dip my toes into stocks, so over the next few years I devoured every bit of literature I could find on the subject, mostly focusing on the works of the greats like Warren Buffet and Ray Dalio, etc. I\u2019d already been investing in index funds for about 10 years or so, but in July of 2020, I felt like I was finally ready to take the plunge, so I registered for an account with Fidelity and after much consideration I loaded up what I believed to be a pretty-well balanced portfolio that could potentially grow my trifling savings and supplement my paltry income as a freelance translator.   \n\nFast forward to the present and I\u2019ve lost about 30% of my initial investment. That\u2019s mostly on stonks mind you, because my pee-pee is much too small to bear the weight of leverage and options. I have found that I possess an uncanny ability to buy the peaks and sell the dips. I\u2019ve done it multiple times over with all manner of stocks. I firmly seize the reigns when they soar to their lofty heights and then ride them down to their absolute troughs, clinging in utter paralysis until queasiness overcomes me and I seek relief by clicking the sell button.\n\nTruth be told, I have also begun dabbling with some contracts here and there. Though I always try to play it safe, sticking to two months out ATM calls, but somehow every time, within moments of clicking the buy button, the trend lines belligerently reverse, as if to spite me. At this point I am 0 for 10 with my options trades. I have never made money \u2013 Not. One. Single. Time. \n\nAllow me to recount one of my most agonizing trades. My misstep involved a company by the name of Sportsman\u2019s Warehouse. I noticed it was a major holding of Scion Asset Management hand-picked by the OG autist himself Dr. Michael Burry. In mid-October it was trading at about $13/share, giving it a single-digit P/E ratio, amidst peers with valuations nearly double that. The company had reported impressive revenue growth the previous quarter, but much of that income came from bubba wingnuts preemptively scooping up semi-automatic weapons before Paw Biden got a chance to slap a ban on the AR-15. My thesis was that the share price was being punished unduly, and that their diverse revenue streams would buoy the share price in due time. I bought some $13 calls expiring on December 18. I watched over the next two months as the share price continued its jagged downward trajectory and my calls expired worthless. \n\n\u201cThen what happened?\u201d \n\nWell, I\u2019m glad you asked because, the very next trading day Sportsman\u2019s Warehouse announces that it will be acquired by Bass Pro, and then, as if to mock me, the chart produced a handsome green fully engorged candlestick about 40% taller than my strike price.\n\nOn another occasion I followed a hot tip on WSB and bought ATM calls on Atlas Air Worldwide about a week before Congress requested that they to return 630 million dollars granted to them as part of the Payroll Support Program, and the share price tanked. \n\nI was also intrigued by BMC Holdings, a home builder with an ingenious system of flat-pack framing that saved contractors money in labor costs and disposal fees. True to form I rode that one sideways for a few weeks, eventually got bored, and sold it to break even, only to see it moon days later on news of acquisition by a larger rival. \n\nPerhaps the most tragic blunder in my short stint as a trader concerns our beloved GME. I first learned of the GME deep value proposition on this sub in July, and I watched timidly from the sidelines until the share price was sufficiently elevated for my entry. This was probably the closest thing I had ever done to a YOLO. I bought $8,000 worth of shares in late September for 10.98 and held steadfast until October 8 by which time it had declined almost 20%. At about 12:30 pm on that fateful day I decided to cut my losses to the sum of $1,600, cursing the name of the WSB autist who had led me into this ill-conceived trade. I could almost feel the sulci furrowing into my smooth brain as I made up my mind to click the sell button. Henceforth, I would think for myself. Never again would I be led astray by \u201cstock tips\u201d from strangers on the internet, be they the incoherent ravings of a WSB degenerate or the prudent advice of a WSJ sage. I summoned up my reserves of discipline, stood up, and walked away from the trading desk. Well, I suppose we all know what happened about an hour and a half later. GME achieved lift off, propelled by news of the Microsoft partnership and I was left admiring its celestial flight from my decidedly terrestrial vantage point. \n\nThe other day I decided to do a little back-testing, thinking that it might provide some insight into what I have been doing wrong. I plugged in all of the tickers from the portfolio I picked back on day 1 and I found that if I had simply diamond-handed those bitches I would be up like over 100% within the past 6 months. That first day of my foray into investing I had the good sense to buy stuff like NIO, BILI, AMD, and BMCH, and I had every intention of holding them forever, but then I found this sub and decided to try some more \u201cadvanced\u201d strategies.\n\nNow I scan my watchlist and notice how every single ticker has just kept bouncing along higher and higher. It seems, so inconceivable that my account balance has followed the opposite trajectory. How could this happen? What went wrong? I managed to lose money buying stocks in one of the biggest bull markets in history. My timing was so impeccable. I was somehow able to enter even stocks with tremendous upward momentum and exit just after a major correction. I am a true prodigy at buying high and selling low. It occurs to me (as it must to all shitty traders) that if I had simply taken a short position on all of those trades, I would have actually tucked away a 30% gain. Have I just been fooling myself into feigned bullishness all along? Was I born to be a bear?\n\n*Processing img ru7m5v9hc5961...*\n\nTL;DR \n\nValue investing is for chumps. Buy and hold actually works.",

        "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI have been lurking on here for quite some time now and, going into 2021, I figured I'd start a thread to ask some of my questions for 2021. Maybe I will see them answered, or read suggestions / find inspiration.\n\nI started investing about three months ago and am currently invested in Vanguard All World, SAP (buying after the dip has worked out well), ICLN, Nvidia, AMD. I intend to hold all of them long-term with a hopeful profit of over 5%. Nvidia has a bit more room to grow, I hope, given their sales numbers, different tech and ARM acqusition, and I am also hoping for incredible sales numbers of AMD. \n\n I also hold GME because I am an absolute sheep idiot who bought into the hype high; I will probably sell low but am waiting for Jan 11. In the next few days, I want to buy a bit of Microsoft for 2021. Overall, I am looking for a relatively \"safe\" return of at least 5 - 10%, ideally a bit more of course. All my stock choices, however, are very tech-oriented. That is because it's the field in which I know most about the companies and their numbers, and also because they've been running well.\n\nHowever, I am very new and none of this of course means that these companies will run well in 2021. If we start seeing a return to normalcy in mid 2021, what are stocks that really benefit from that return to \"normalcy\"? I figured Salesforce could be an option because of its dip and them also probably benefiting from overall economic upturn, just like SAP. But that, again, would be tech. I read JPM and on this subreddit a lot, what would be the reasoning here? People are also mentioning Disney: is that because of Disney+ or because of reopening theme parks? \n\nSo, as you can see, I am open for suggestions. It'd be cool if you could help me out a bit! Thank you in advance. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot invest in ARK ETFs, as none of my three European brokers offer these funds, and I am not willing to open a fourth broker account.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week.
