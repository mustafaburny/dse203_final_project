It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

        "selftext": "Okay you gang of deluded retards, I'm going to drop some actual useful DD for you. tl;dr and positions at the top, because I know that for the majority of you, \"Fedex parked in front of White House, buy calls\", is as sophisticated DD as your deformed cuckold brains can handle. This is a long post so for those of you who actually want to understand why you're taking a position and learn about a commodity, read on; for those of you who don't, fuck off.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR AND POSITIONS**\n\nTankers will have their best earnings call in at least 5 years, if not the last decade, due to all-time-high tanker rates that began spiking towards mid-March. Rates are so high that, say, companies with clean LR2 tankers currently run a spot price of 8x the 5 year historical average and 1 single 2 month voyage is enough to be profitable on the entire year. You're looking to make bets on tanker companies that are trading below their NAV, will post strong FCF, were well positioned for the spike in prices, have large fleets, and have the right types of ships. $NAT is literally the meme-iest stock because it's actually the worst across every single one of these dimensions of any tanker company.\n\n**TL;DR ON WHY NAT IS A MEME:**\n\nLet me draw you an analogy:\n\nWSB is a class in school, and you've all decided not to be homosexual for a day, and NAT is a girl in class. As a result, you all start sending her dick pics and showering NAT with attention, assuming that she is extremely high value. However, in your autistic haste, you all forgot to look around and actually there are 15 other girls in the classroom, and they are all way hotter than NAT. NAT is actually ugly and fat, but you're too busy tunnel visioning in on NAT while you beat off to realize that literally every option is better. As a result, NAT is now overvalued, but a bunch of you are stubborn fuckfaces who continue to shower her with attention because you're too autistic to admit you had no fucking idea what you were doing this whole time.\n\n**POSITIONS:**\n\n**Lowest Risk Position Examples**\n\n* EuroNav ($EURN) $12.50C 6/15\n* Scorpio Tankers ($STNG) $23C 6/15\n\n**Moderate Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $12.50C 5/15\n* $STNG $25C 5/15\n\n**Higher Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $15C 5/15\n* $STNG $30C 5/15\n\n**Legendary Autistic Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $17.50C 5/15\n* $STNG $35C 5/15\n* $NAT, any calls\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**SECTION 1: Overview on Oil Demand Crisis**\n\nIf you understand oil demand destruction and contango, skip ahead. However, based on the fact that people continue to pile in on USO and UCO calls and leaps under the justification of \"hurr durr oil must go up, right, so cheap\", and half of you are bagholding $NAT still, I assume 75%+ of you are retarded.\n\nMany of you still probably have no idea what's happening with oil and why it's fucked long-term. The tl;dr here is that even with OPEC+'s historical cuts, we're still drastically oversupplied. The problem with oil is it's not your meme SPY calls that are in the cloud; oil is a physical product and when you trade USO, you're trading (theoretically) on receiving delivery of oil. We are almost completely out of oil storage already.\n\nYou may ask, well [u/safuros](https://www.reddit.com/u/safuros/), if that's true, why don't we turn off the wells? Markets naturally handle supply and demand. Well, you worthless piece of shit, while your child-groping Honors Econ teacher may have drawn a graph once upon a time in high school when you still had the potential not to be a useless person as you are now, oil production isn't that simple. The reason every country is sandbagging and trying to get other countries to cut oil is that there's a game theory element in play, as well as an oil well intrinsic function issue.\n\nOnce oil wells reduce their production to roughly 50-60% of output, they *cannot go any lower* without risking destroying the well, which is extraordinarily expensive to get the rights to drill on and also is like throwing out a gallon of water when you've only taken a sip. Thus, the only option to reduce further is to entirely stop production and cap the well, and then, assuming your lease on the well hasn't lapsed by the time you can re-open it, uncap it, both of which are extraordinarily expensive. Therefore, most oil companies are far, far better off continuing to produce oil at a loss, because that's still a long-term better play than turning off. Moreover, why the fuck should you be the well to turn off, if other's aren't? Add in the fact that everyone cheats on oil production cuts and the Saudis and Russians are trying to fuck each other and the US in the ass, and you've got a nice oil crisis.\n\nThis leads to the USO/UCO shit show and negative WTI price. Normally, futures holders offload their contracts to buyers who intend to actually take physical delivery as the option expiration date draws near. However, because there is no storage and no demand, none of the typical buyers actually wanted to buy, so you had a bunch of tendie seeking autists desperately trying to offload their contracts so that they wouldn't have 5 dumptrucks of oil barrels delivered to their homes and be completely fucked, such that they were willing to *pay* people (i.e. negative price) to take their contracts. As for contango, well, google it.\n\nFinally, this problem isn't going away any time soon because unless you're so truly deluded as to believe that we'll not only have a V shaped re-opening in terms of social, commercial, and consumer behavior, but that fuel consumption across airlines and cars will rebound immediately, we're on a long term path to recovery, and we're already out of supply. This is like having a clogged bathtub full of water and turning the faucet from 100% on to 50% on - you're still fucked until the faucet turns off (impossible) or the clog goes away more than enough to offset the faucet (not happening for a while). This is why experts broadly agree that [the OPEC+ cuts are meaningless](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/4/21/opecplus-mega-deal-rendered-meaningless-by-demand-destruction) and that groups like Morgan Stanley believe [demand destruction of oil will persist until well into 2021](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Morgan-Stanley-Oil-Demand-Wont-Return-To-Normal-Until-End-2021.html).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**SECTION 2: A brief overview of Tankers**\n\nYou don't need much of a brain to understand, given the above, why tankers stand to benefit from demand destruction. However, there are many types of tankers, and it's not as obvious as hurr durr buy tankers. Each tanker type carries a different type of product, has a different size, and commands a different rate. Here is the current rates:\n\n[3 key types of tanker business models, spread across a variety of tanker variants](https://preview.redd.it/hd3q2ncaqmw41.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fca616d8afc83afa14721af8e2e5bd1bf243fadd)\n\nAt this point I'm realizing that this post is getting way too long and i'm tired of typing it already, but do your own research on types of tankers. You can see though that tankers are commanding a stupidly high rate compared to their historical values:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8u5q1odqmw41.jpg?width=1081&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bc3668993ed1965a45f8c9af5a7a07f16e851b5\n\nThe current rates are so high that [one spot voyage is profitable on the entire year](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/tankers/tanker-rates-one-spot-voyage-makes-the-whole-year-in-red-hot-market/2-1-801368).\n\n&gt;\"If an MR can get $30,000 per day on a spot voyage, it covers its costs for a year...If an LR2 gets $150,000 or $160,000 a day, it\u2019s the same...you could lay the ship up, earn zero for the next ten months, and still make a profit on the ship.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Guess who owns the most clean-fuel ready LR2's that are exposed to the spot price? $STNG](https://preview.redd.it/iyeeu45gqmw41.jpg?width=894&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b23175ca9c77eb406cadc5b01411c22545e72d59)\n\nNow, don't be stupid and assume that rates will hold this high all year. That said, even if rates went to $0 by mid summer, the rates for Q2 are so high such that it'd still be a higher revenue year than last year. And rates aren't going to $0...they're going to continue to stay above the historical average, just not as high as now, due to the crazy demand destruction.\n\n* **Miscellaneous point of clarification:** I see a lot of dumbasses posting about what numbers will look like if the entire fleet is booked out for, say, NAT. That's ridiculous and not how it works, so don't just go number of tankers x spot rate = revenue for year = tendies.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Section 3: Why $STNG and $EURN?**\n\nI really need to go fuck your wife soon, so I'm making the sections shorter and shorter. But i'll still tell you way $STNG and $EURN are good bets. First, let's start with NAV - **N**et **A**sset **V**alue. If you don't know what this means, Google it.\n\nAs you (should) know, NAV is something you estimate and can be calculated differently based on different assumptions. Trading below NAV means the stock is underpriced as is, and that's before record earnings and guidance. By most accounts, $EURNs NAV is at least $13 currently, and $STNG is close to $30. They trade at $10 and $21, respectively, right now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$STNG isn't even at it's average price for 2019, but 2020 is objectively a better year unless a meteor blows up their fleet](https://preview.redd.it/smsydzfnqmw41.jpg?width=2001&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b4de32295c00a853844ad5de51c44e7aeabbe0c)\n\nSecondly, fleet size and type. $STNG has one of the largest fleets in the world, and in particular, they have the most LR2 tankers. If you go back up to the graph, you'll see that clean LR2 tankers are commanding an absurd rate, spiking to as high as $250,000 for a few days and currently settled around $150-175k/day, compared to a 5-year historical value of below $25k. $EURN has a solid fleet of VLCC's which are commanding a strong rate, and EURN has good financials - most their boats are fairly new, they don't have a ton of debt.\n\nLastly, they're among the first up on the earnings block, with STNG reporting 5/6 this week and EURN reporting on 5/7. Compare that to NAT, who reports the 23rd, so theta will eat away at what remains of your atrophied testicles every day. That said, regardless of theta, STNG and EURN are really strongly positioned.\n\nI expect that earnings will be solid and likely beat, but not by a crazy amount because rates only started really jacking up in late March, and rates in early Q1 were actually pretty low. However, as many of you still don't fucking understand, **earnings don't matter nearly as much as** **guidance.** That's why you dumbfucks all complain about companies beating earnings but still tanking and then creating stupid conspiracy theories about \"MM is fucking rigging this market\". Guidance for tankers is going to be **euphoric**.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Section 4: Why is $NAT a meme, and mistakes I see people making**\n\nUltimately, this comes down to people angling towards the right space (tankers) but you've been too stupid to do any research. You probably do this for all your bets, because you're a fucking autist, but you should stop.\n\n1. Fleet size misconception: Cramer meme'd NAT, infamously calling out that they have the largest fleet in the world. In fact, if you actually tried to verify anything you ever fucking did, you could have googled this and realized that NAT has a fleet that, just like your dick, is one of the smallest around. Moreover, they have the wrong type of boats - they primarily have Suezmax boats, which command an okay rate, but aren't close to the best boats to have right now.\n2. No investigation of NAV: NAT's NAV, by all accounts, is close to $3. They are trading at close to $6, and were nearing $8-9 at peak pump. Why the fuck on god's green earth would you buy a company with the wrong type of boats, the wrong fleet size, trading at over 2x NAV, when everyone else is around or below their NAV and has a better fleet?\n3. Massive debt and shitty assets: NAT is saddled in debt, is historically shittily managed (read their earnings report if you know how, but you probably don't know how), and all their boats are at the end of their lifetime, meaning NAT not only has horrible debt but will need to buy a shit ton of new boats very soon\n4. Stupid assumptions on revenue: We covered this earlier, but no, just because demand is high, it doesn't mean every boat is going to get booked at the spot price. Many boats are on existing contracted rates from last quarter, and the ones who are not are not all getting booked out at once.\n5. Looking at ATH as an indicator: If i see another one of you dumb fucks pointing out that NAT used to trade at $16 5 years ago, I will personally find you, tape you to a chair, and shit down your mouth. NAT has issued a shit ton more shares. You are probably the same group who thinks that USO went from $2 to $18 last week.\n\nThe ONLY justification for NAT is now that it's been memed and retail knows all about it, it will probably rise again if the other tankers do well. You can make that play, and you might even make money. Just make sure to dump that shit before earnings because they're not going to be good enough to justify the rise and there's going to be a stupid dump.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**MY POSITIONS:**\n\n\\- 40 $STNG 5/15 $23C\n\n\\- 200 $EURN 5/15 $12.5C\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nFuck you",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR**: China needs dollars badly, not gay little treasuries yielding 1%. They will not purchase treasuries at the next auctions and interest rates will spike. Chaos in the bonds market will lead to chaos in the stock market. Bears,go in for the kill. Bulls, close your long positions on the 11th and reopen them at noon on the 13th. What makes this play so beautiful is just how well it can be timed. $TLT ATM put 5/15 purchased 5/11.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*Automod didn't like the full post, I'm going to be editing this together in parts to figure out what word or phrase is triggering it, bare with me here\\*\\**\n\nThis post will start off with some ECON 101 shit for the autists who never learned the basics. If you already know why bond prices move in  the opposite direction as interest rates and why China buys so much US debt, then skip ahead. The bond market dwarfs the size of the stock market, there is about 9 times as much outstanding bond value as there is total market cap. Bonds are where the big boys play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Interest rates and bond pricing\n\n**When interest rates rise, the prices of old bonds fall, and when interest rates fall, the prices of old bonds rise.**\n\nConsider a zero coupon bond, one where you pay a certain amount and at the end of the bond term you get paid back more (unless you\u2019re a cucked German bond buyer). For a one year bond with a 5% yield, you would pay$95.24 for the privilege of redeeming the bond for $100 in one year\\[Formula:(end value \u2013 price)/price = interest rate\\]. But what if the next day interest rates fall to 3%? The bond you just bought suddenly looks a lot more attractive. Its yielding a lot more than the bonds the suckas are buying today. If you turned around and sold it the next day, you could scalp off the extra yield and sell it as though it were 3% bond. Using the same formula, you could sell it for $97.04. Nice. If on the other hand, the interest rate rose to 7%then everyone trying to make a buck would want the bonds they buy to yield 7%. In order to sell your 5% bond, you would have to take a loss to make it attractive. The new price of the same bond would be $93.48.\n\n**The sensitivity of a bond\u2019s price to interest rates, depends on the bond\u2019s time to maturation.**\n\nThe more years a bond has to collect interest, the more the rates affect the bond\u2019s price. Consider a bond that pays 5% a year, compounded annually. In practice, only savings bonds compound, but any bond can be recalculated as if they compound. That bond would cost $231.38 and pay out$1000 at maturation \\[Formula: end value = price \\* interest rate \\^ years\\]. If the next day, interest rates increased to 7%, U R FUK. That bond would now sell for a paltry $131.37. If interest rates fell to 3%, your investment would nearly double to $411.99. If they fell to 1% you could sell that bond for$741.93. Damn WSBGod. That\u2019s the power of compound interest. Below in the DD section, there\u2019s a more realistic graph showing approximately how $TLT will respond to interest rate movements.\n\n**Interest rates depend upon supply and demand for a bond.**\n\nThe fundamental rule of microeconomics: prices are set by supply and demand. Therefore, the discount and interest payments of a bond depend crucially on what market participants want, their *demand*.  Suppose you know a company, Widgettech, that sells widgets is run by a  complete moron and that Widgettech is trying to raise capital by selling bonds. There\u2019s another company WidgetDotCom, run competently, that currently sells their zero coupon bonds with a 3% discount. Would you buy Widgettech bonds at 3%? Hell no. You need to receive a premium for that. The same is true for government bonds: th eUS 10 year is trading at 0.6% interest while the Brazilian 10 year is trading at 8% interest. Investors need to be compensated for the risk that Brazil can\u2019t pay them back. Demand for crappy bonds is low. Demand for good bonds is high\n\n*Supply* is another fundamental issue. If you want $100 to YOLO, you could probably get a loan from your dad. If you want to YOLO $10 million you\u2019re going to need to look elsewhere. The larger the loan you want, the more market participants you\u2019re going to need to engage. To get that  $10 million you\u2019re probably going to need to put your tin cup before a bunch of banks and all your friends and family. To make them pay any attention to you, you\u2019re going to need to make them a damn good offer. It can\u2019t be the \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back next week\u201d that you might do with your dad. It would have to be \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back an additional 50%.\u201d When a company or nation wants to take on substantially more debt, they will need to raise the interest rate to get more people to drop some change in the tin cup they\u2019re rattling.",

A report just came out showing over 20.5 million Americans lost their jobs in April. We're now at a a top level unemployment rate of 14.7%. The Dow is up over 350 points as I type this.\n\nWhat CNBC and other media outlets won't tell you in their hacky \"[Why the stock market is up even with historic job losses](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/why-the-market-is-up-even-with-historic-job-losses.html)\" articles, is that quite a few public companies can weather the storm, while many main street businesses will close permanently. In other words, large corporations are essentially \"buying out\" these small businesses in the long run.

        "selftext": "During one of the coronavirus task force briefings, an admiral came up and detailed how he was getting ventilators into the system. Much of the press was outraged when he detailed it out because the government was using a middle man that was profiting off it. The admiral\u2019s response? \u201cMy job is not to invent a system. My job is to put volume in the system.\u201d\n\nSuch is the realities of leadership in a time of crisis.\n\nSo. When the Fed went into \u2018save everything mode,\u2019 they did so with a desire to unfreeze credit markets and make sure markets functioned. Powell\u2019s job was to put volume into the system.\n\nThat system now has volume. And plenty of it. Everyone is buying everyone else\u2019s debt. Disney wants five billion for a year? Wells Fargo says \u2018COUNT ME IN.\u2019 Boeing is issuing bonds? \u2018IT\u2019S A RAID,\u2019 says every person with access to debt markets. Delta can\u2019t fly 10% capacity this quarter. People buy their debt like it\u2019s the liftoff of the 747.\n\nSo the system now has ample volume going back and forth. Everyone\u2019s leveraged to the tits in new debt. What could possibly go wrong?\n\n30-50 million unemployed is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nAlready high household debt continues to skyrocket as new income falls off a cliff is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nReckless debt issuance and a borrowing system that never really reset after 2008-9 is what\u2019s wrong.\n\nIn what will likely go down as the dumbest FOMO among smart money of all time, every major institution has tried its best to get in on every company\u2019s debt offerings. But what happens if Delta sees just 30% of flying traffic in the third quarter? What if California and France refuse to open Disney\u2019s parks until early July and shut them down again in September as precaution? And would anyone really be surprised if Boeing doesn\u2019t get the 737 max off the ground until 2021?\n\nThese events have a decent probability of happening. And such companies as Delta and Boeing may not be able to service their debt at the end of 2020 if, say, we have to shut everything back down to prevent a second wave.\n\nNot every bond holder is going to get screwed. But the rate of defaults on loans is going to be much higher than the laughable estimates JPM and Well\u2019s have set cash aside for.\n\nLet\u2019s keep in mind: it wasn\u2019t the Fed\u2019s job to invent a new system. Its job was to keep the current system functioning.\n\nSo what is the system they\u2019re pumping? The debt system. And all they\u2019ve really done is re-inflate a debt bubble to a much bigger size than it was in February. And given the details released today by the Fed essentially announcing they'll be buying HYG and LQD, this bubble is growing to hindenburg-sized levels.\n\nWith people putting their rent on credit cards, our system is just surviving right now. But what happens in wave two?\n\nBoeing can\u2019t pay its coupon as Delta withdraws all orders so it can attempt to service debt too big to pay itself. An empire like Disney looks at risk for shuttering. Restaurants are seen as germ lands by the average consumer and nobody goes dining in for several years. Housing construction companies simply cannot survive the epic demand and supply destruction with defaults on mortgages skyrocketing as well. Fannie and Freddie make 2008 look like a prelude to the real story. And the Fed may have to try and get out of HYG as companies in the ETF fail and they have to preserve tax payer dollars as per their legal obligation, which will only further feed the negative feedback loop.\n\nAt Buffet\u2019s shareholder meeting saturday, he praised Powell\u2019s speed to get credit markets functioning again. On top of that, he said March was the highest bond issuance month of all time, followed by April breaking that record.\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting in what he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the consequences of this will be.\u201d\n\nSo perhaps we are somehow able to punt the debt bubble pop down the road by allowing all loans to defer for extended periods. Perhaps the US government is able to find some way to write off certain types of debt in a last resort effort to avoid economic catastrophe. They will certainly get creative as everyone becomes desperate. But in all likelihood, these kinds of ideas are untenable without resulting in extreme damage to other segments of the economy.\n\nWe are on the brink of the debt bubble collapse. And given a second wave, we will create a negative feedback loop that will slump the United States Markets for years.\n\nI don't believe we will have a 10 year great depression. We learned so much from that time period and we will use that knowledge to recover faster, and maybe even better. But like the civil war, world war one, and world war two: everyone thought at the beginning of each outbreak it was only going to last a few months. We think the same thing now about this crisis.\n\nTL;DR: Often when you are operating in a paradigm you don\u2019t realize the flaw of that paradigm until you are forced to shift into a new paradigm. The debt bubble paradigm is about to shift, but not before it pops.",

The chart looked like this:\n\n[End of week March 20th](https://preview.redd.it/bupxssadn7x41.png?width=1300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c85dbdef1e3d68a93b5a4972168df2100340943)\n\nSince then, the Fed has announced trillions in monetary stimulus, numerous programs, the SEC relaxed all sorts of rules, Congress passed 2 trillion in relief, and markets have rallied a historic amount. All bullish things, yes. But how bullish can they be, amidst a 1Q GDP blowing by the expected -3.5% to -4.8%, disastrous earnings reports, 30 million jobless claims in that same timespan, the oil sector CRASHING and trading negative for the first time ever, every economic forecasting model projecting a longer and deeper recession than previously thought, as well as every standard data point (ISM, housing, manu, etc) being more negative than the expectation. For every positive event the market has seen, there have been numerous negative events and data points, and yet this market has rallied at a historic rate: even the NASDAQ is now positive for the year. 6000 points in the Dow Jones. the S&amp;P has rallied nearly 700 points off the lows.\n\nSO let me ask that question again: what do you remember about march 18th? Well, how about this to refresh your memory:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5sjcbrhkm7x41.png?width=1850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6614cc36bb9fa85c4a0d66f8fb0a09fe0aed29e4\n\nSo, let's take a look at the chart since March 23rd, the day humans were no longer allowed to be on the trading floor, the day we decided, okay we'll trust the computers and do everything digitally, we can trust those billionaires and Market Makers and institutions regulated by a government whose very survival depends on the markets going higher regardless of the economic devastation they're going through. Let's take a look at the chart THE EXACT DAY the human element of trading was removed: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2a8qb7np7x41.png?width=2399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15f58eb9435214ff3691fd1f81bf2af3af6037f1\n\nYahoo Finance sucks, but I like the color feature and percentage filled in for you: a 23.58% gain. Fucking ROCKET ship. Disney has disastrous earnings, fuck it let's stay above 100. GDP blows by expectations at probably the biggest surprise in history comparing real number versus expected? Fuck it let's moon. Powell keeps printing, right, that's driving it higher, right? \n\nNo. What's driving it higher, is MMs and HFTs using programs to inflate the stocks. Retail traders make up a sliver of volume and portion of the markets. If you think some college kid YOLOing his stimulus check on options is what's bringing this market money, you're smoking crack and exactly the kind of autist we expect here on WSB. But if you're able to think critically for yourself, you'll realize why this is the biggest con we're going through:\n\nPension funds (federal state and local), Billion dollar university endowments, financial investment institutions, Hedge Funds, hold the vast majority of wealth in the markets, and they have decided along with the government, to fuck fundamentals, fuck reality, fuck the real economy, we're going to inflate the shit out of these markets and prop them up. Algorthimic trading from HFTs can easily manipulate buys back and forth. The SEC has removed all sorts of rules and regulations, and the government is going to intentionally turn a blind eye, because Capitalism itself was at stake. They're letting the market makers dictate their own reality, and we have severed ourselves from all fundamentals. \n\nSo what are the implications? For one, the market is going to trend higher until some big dog up top says it's time for a taste of reality. My guess is honestly when people return to the floors, and these funds and players have all properly hedged and prepared. They're doing some illegal shit, insane manipulation, and they're going to get away with it. To fight them, is to fight the system, and some WSB autist or Robinhood options trader aren't ever going to win that battle. One of two things is going to happen: they're going to get away with it and we accept the reality of living in a rigged market, the free market being completely dead, OR: someone comes out with a documentary exposing all this a few years from now, and gets depressed and commits suicide with a bullet to the back of their head. \n\nThe con is in, the rigging has been done, jump on board or be crushed by the corrupt who wield all that power. Prepare to do nothing but shop online with Amazon and Wayfair. Prepare to eat your veggie meat to feed the world in Beyond Meat, prepare to always watch your content heavily regulated by the Mouse, prepare to live on an internet censored by Big Tech pro China companies, and  watch as all those people who can live free thanks to Jeffrey Epstein's suicide live like gods above you.",

        "selftext": "Hello you dirty little bastards it\u2019s me, u/expander2 from the DD summaries that clog up your feed three times a week. I'm here with something a little different from what I normally do. I\u2019m gonna learn ya how to play earnings like the big shots down in NYC. Okay not really like them but I am going to teach you how to do it like you aren't the stupidest crayon in the pencil box.\n\nSo let me lay out a little table of contents for you first. I am going to;\n\n* Explain what goes into picking a play\n* Go through how to know when to sell and when to have diamond hands\n* Show some examples of earnings plays I have advocated for in the past\n* Give general pointers/ a wrap up\n* Be incredibly crude and border on stage 4 autism\n\nSo let's get right into it shall we?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How do I pick an earnings play?**\n\nFirst things first, what is an earnings play? An earnings play is when you bet, either using options or buying shares, that a company is going to either do good or bad when they report their earnings. Earnings are reported quarterly which, for most companies, means they are reported April/May for Quarter 1, July/August for Quarter 2, October/November for Quarter 3, and January/February for Quarter 4. These months are called \u201cEarnings Season\u201d. We can use earnings to decide if a company is doing good or bad and if they will do good or bad in the future. Good quarter (increased revenue, profit, etc.) stock price usually goes up. Bad quarter (net loss, supply problems, scandels, etc.) stock price usually goes down.\n\nSo how do I pick one? Well my little shit-stain, you pick a company or industry that you feel you can anticipate easily. It sounds easier than it is, I know. So let's run through a little example. You start hearing about this Covid thing in March. You think, \u201cHey, if medical PPE (personal protective equipment) is hard to come by right now, then a lot of people must be buying it!\u201d That's the first step, put two and two together and realize that world events do, in fact, influence the economy. So now that we know PPE must have a high demand, we can look to the next step which is research companies that will benefit (or do bad) if the situation in question happens.\n\nThis research is a BIG part of an earnings play. I know that here on WSB we like to jump headfirst into plays without doing any research whatsoever, but if you want to make money then I would do at least a little bit. Research;\n\n* What a company does\n* What their main sources of revenue are\n* HOW MUCH DEBT THEY HAVE\n* How much cash they have\n* And what influences their sources of revenue\n\nThe debt part is very important along with the sources of revenue and their influences. With debt you want to look for if it is manageable or not. I wont get into that here but my boy u/fuzzyblankeet writes many a great post about how to read a corporate debt sheet. Try [this post about PLAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx6b0t/playtimes_over_fuzzy_does_db/) and you should have a good bit of information for that smooth brain to digest. The key takeaway is that debt and when it expires drives how a company spends their money and if they can profit in the long run. Of course, know where the company's revenue comes from. Does it come from what they produce? Does it come from advertising? Where do they attract the most customers from? What geographical area does the majority of their sales come from? Blah, blah, blah, you guys get the gist. You don't need to understand every aspect of the company, not even the CEO\u2019s know everything about their companies. You just need to know enough to comprehend where a company can go if they have a good or bad quarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**When do I sell and when do I hold?**\n\nNow that we have a company we want to play, we buy in and wait until we get close to earnings. Unless I am getting ridiculous returns way before earnings, like 200%, I hold until I get within a few days of earnings. Now here is the tricky part. The obvious thing to do is that if you think a company is going to have a good quarter, you hold through earnings and ride that price sky high. Well, that can be true but a lot goes into it. Let's go through a few scenarios.\n\nA company is trading pretty sideways for days and days. It gets to the day before earnings and is still trading sideways, doesn\u2019t have a lot of volatility. This is a prime example of investors not really being worried about earnings at all. Earnings will still influence the price but major swings aren\u2019t likely. Earnings being good will lead to new investors buying in and bad earnings will mean investors will sell but for the most part the market doesn\u2019t anticipate anything big happening. It's best just to hold these through earnings and hope it goes the way you anticipate.\n\nThis next scenario deals with you thinking a stock is going to go up because of earnings but it will also work in reverse when dealing with put options. So earnings come out tomorrow. The price was trading steadily around $69 for the past few days. All of the sudden, the day before earnings, the price begins to shoot up to $71, then $73, then by 3 o\u2019clock it's at $75 a share. This is evidence of the market ANTICIPATING good earnings. Earnings haven't come out yet but, as we say all too often, they are already \u201cpriced in\u201d. Now when earnings come out things can pretty much go two ways. The price can continue to go up because earnings were somehow BETTER than anticipated. Or, (and this is the more likely scenario) the price will drop after earnings because they weren't quite as good as the market anticipated. This is what happens when your calls rocket in value before earnings then bottom out after, and you sit there sobbing with your tendies out the window saying, \u201cbUT EarNInGs wERe gOOD!\u201d It sucks, but I\u2019ve seen this exact scenario happen many times and it has happened to me too. So the best thing to do here is if there is a large run-up the day BEFORE earnings, take your gains before they release and don't be greedy (we will get more into that later).\n\nThe last scenario deals with more volatile stocks. Let's say you bought calls on a stock that you think is going to go up after earnings. The week of earnings it is jumping around like a nutsack on a jog. It started at $20, then dropped to $17, then up to $24, back down to $19, all the way to $27, then back down to $16 before earnings are reported. We can gather from these crazy fluctuations that there are conflicting ideas on what the results of earnings will be. From here, the best thing to do is to just stick with your DD and hold through earnings, because clearly nobody fucking knows whats gonna happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some real world examples**\n\nI'll break down some lingo here real quick. If you already know just skip to the next header where it says LAKE. When I say I bought calls for a certain date (4/17), I mean they expire that day and I can no longer trade them. Strike, is the number I think the share price can rise to or be on the way to when I sell. The decimal numbers (.70, 1.10) are the premium you pay per share to buy an option contract. So a .70 premium will cost $70 to buy, 1.10 will cost $110. That should let you understand a little more.\n\n**LAKE;** First, let's look at the Lakeland Industries play I advocated for a while ago. We go through the research process and decide that a medical PPE company will make money because of the coronavirus. I'll go ahead and use my own plays so I don't have to make a bunch of shit up.\n\nEarnings for LAKE came out on 4/15 after hours. On 4/8 they were trading at a low around $14.95. I bought calls for 4/17 (after earnings) at $17.5 strike for .70. Then on 4/14 I doubled down and bought calls for 4/17 at $20 strike for .30 and at that point they were trading around $16.50. Then comes 4/15, they have a run-up all day and at one point hit $18. THIS IS THE POINT I SOLD. I sold BEFORE earnings and took my profits. The $17.5 strike had jumped to 1.45 and the $20 had jumped to .65. These are both over a 100% gain.\n\nAfter close earnings were released. They were great. It showed an increase in revenue, less debt, and a bunch of other good shit. The only problem was it wasn't as high as people anticipated. On 4/16 LAKE hit lows of $15. This is just how it happens sometimes.\n\n**JNJ;** We also have the Johnson and Johnson play from the 4/9-4/13 post. They make medical stuff, home staples, you know what JNJ is.\n\nEarnings came out 4/14 before open. On 4/13 they were trading around $139.77 and this is when I bought in. I got calls for 4/17 at $147 strike for .60. That day it stayed pretty low because no one expected earnings to be fantastic. They were fantastic and the price soared to $146 on 4/14. I sold that day to lock in gains and protect myself from a sudden drop of other people cashing out their gains. The value went from .60 to 1.10 for an 83% gain.\n\nNow the price kept going up in the following days and honestly I should have held for longer. I would have if I would have bought longer dated calls. Overall, what I did here was a good choice but I could have squeezed more money out of it if I was more reckless. That is the key word, reckless. Not taking such a large gain and hoping that it will go up just a little more is reckless in the long run even if it would have worked out this time.\n\n**HAS;** Last we will look at Hasbro which a few of us got burned on last week. I bought some HAS calls for 5/8 at $85 strike for 1.10. Earnings were set to come out 4/29.\n\nThe day before earnings the price went way up for my options. I was looking at over 100% profits. This should have been the perfect sign for me to sell because earnings can't be good enough to rationalize such a run-up. I didn't sell. Earnings came out and they reported barely breaking even. Investors thought it would be a good quarter, it wasn't. Now I\u2019m stuck bagholding these options waiting for them to expire at the end of the week so they can get the fuck out of my portfolio. DON'T BE GREEDY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**General pointers/ Wrap up**\n\nTruly, the best thing you can take away from this is to not be greedy. Take the profits you get. The difference between a 100% gain and a 100% loss can be holding just one day too long. Take in the signs and learn how to read the market trends. Price goes up before earnings? Sell and lock in gains. Price goes stagnant? Hold. Price goes opposite where you thought it would? You are either very wrong or know something that no one else does and you might as well hold.\n\nHere on WSB, the consensus is usually to make as much as possible for the meme. Well, do you want to be a meme or do you want to consistently make money. I know your answer is you want to be a meme but you know what the smart answer is. If you have over 50% gains (which is more than most professional investors make) take it. Protect yourself.\n\nAlso, if you can't afford to lose your entire account then you shouldn't be doing this. If your Robinhood balance hits $0 you should not be worrying about how you are going to pay bills it should just be an \u201coh well\u201d moment. And remember for the few and far in between moments that you do make money, put some back for capital gains taxes so you don't get fucking audited.  [This post explains](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgfr97/taxes_how_to_treat_those_sweet_tendie_gains/) a lot that you need to know in regards to taxes. \n\nThat's all I really have for you. I hope this makes earnings plays a little easier to understand. It takes practice and practice leads to losses, just don't get too butt hurt. We all lose at some point and the only way to consistently win is to not play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Fuck you, read it. You need all the help you can get.",

        "selftext": "What people right now are expecting to happen, is that states will reopen, and people will wait and see if there are news of a \"second wave\" or new infections. And then people will all panic and realize that we're either back to lockdown or half a million people will die, or it magically \"disappear\". Only then, people are assuming that the market will react.\n\nBut the other investors on the other side are just as smart as you. There are probably very few people who think reopening will not cause a rise in infection. The smart money is definitely not that dumb. This is hot potato and the first to leave wins. \n\nThis has to happen before you're expecting it, because the smart money has no reason to stay that long if they can leave before it. Why would they? Would you do it? They won't wait for the news they know will come. Hell I bet some of them even control when the media calls it \"second wave\". It's all very arbitrary, calling it waves gives the media the power over public opinion. It's open to interpretation. But call it a second wave and there you go, you have the public primed for a sell sign. That sell sign will come as a scare, to squeeze people to panic sell, not as the trigger to the initial selloff. Prices will be already low when that happens and they will use that to maximize buying. They would want those headlines to come when they can push stocks below their worth, not as a reminder to correct their prices.\n\nA \"second wave\" headline will happen because the media won't be silent over fast increasing case counts. Retail investors will sell on that news. Smart money won't let other investors pull out before the headline comes, if they can maximize their sell before. \n\nSo the question, what is the timeline you think this will happen.

With dollar signs in my eyes I tried my hardest to unlock the green RH theme buying $ROPE and $CSV like the memes said, but I was #redgang until all my savings were gone. So I studied all the DD posts for months, made new savings, and set out to lose that too. I found a JavaScript machine learning tutorial on YouTube and got to work, mostly watching tendie porn on wsb every few minutes to refresh my false sense of hope.\n\nNow my script is finished, using machine learning on every DD thread I could find, analyzing the resistance, taking into account I, II, III, IV crush groups like they said, and cross referencing the greeks against fibonacci sequencing models. Everything I could possibly learn from WSB, I fed into the machine learning script so it generates a list of the top 69,420 positions on the market every time I open Internet Explorer. Then I inversed the list order, flipped the strike projections, watched The Big Short for the 3rd time that morning, and started trading. This shitter bot then somehow pulled off three consecutive weeks of 100% returns paper trading, so I decided to share the automated autism with you broke fucks so we can all lose our money together.

        "selftext": "One thing I have learned trading this market for many years is that the fundamentals always play out. The question is all about timing. If you sold when SPX was near the bottom, you\u2019d be massively screwed. \n\nThe fundamentals are bad. Unemployment figures are rising. Many companies have slashed a ton of their profits. Even though the economy is about to re-open, the impact of this on the stock market hasn\u2019t been felt yet and the effects will last a long time. \n\nThe truth is that this drop never happened because of COVID in the first place. It happened because of companies being overvalued and inflated resulting in an eventual collapse. COVID was just a trigger and those fundamentals are still in play. Just two years ago, nearly half of unicorns overstated their valuations, and it got much worse last year and this year: https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/the-vc-bubble-is-going-to-burst-51553077853.

Why do I think this is not just another one of those \u201cHaha it\u2019s going to crash\u201d posts we\u2019ve seen over the last two months? It\u2019s simple. Retail volume has been washed out and reached a peak last week. You can see this through aggregate order flow on stocks most traded by retail such as TSLA (which will drop the hardest). You can see this through the number of people holding stocks like that on Robinhood which has the most retail volume. The influx of retail traders reaching a peak during a rise or during a drop (which occurred at low 220s) is generally indicative of a top or bottom in case of a downtrend. \n\nWhen retail volume peaks in a market where the fundamentals are telling the opposite story, you go short, and you go bigly short.\n\nTL;DR P SPY 240 MAY 22",

        "selftext": "# Background\n\nThere's a 2007 study on the economy during, and the economic recovery following, the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic (sourced below). The study concluded that employment *increased* in the US during the pandemic due to a plethora of new jobs created specific to the problem. There was no shutdown of the economy. I then looked at historical unemployment figures. It's clear to me now that there's absolutely no basis for a quick recovery of employment, especially following black swan events. The V-shaped recovery narrative is bullshit.\n\n[https://www.stlouisfed.org/\\~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic\\_flu\\_report.pdf?la=en](https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic_flu_report.pdf?la=en)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Employment will take years to recover\n\nEmployment can't recover overnight. There's no basis for it. Proportional to the current workforce, the most jobs we've ever gained in a single month was in September of 1983 at 1.18 Million. After that, the jobs gain at the end of WW2 at a little over 951,000 when soldiers returned home from the war. \n\nWe're currently sitting at 36.4 Million unemployed and counting. Hourly employees have been let off; we know white collar is next (see below). The number is only going to expand in the short term. Even if it were to stop at only 40 Million (one more week of job losses), it would take 36 months of the best jobs gain ever in the history of the US to recover to February's employment levels. The argument for a quicker recovery is that many of these people will be immediately rehired. Based on my arguments below for a delayed recovery of many different businesses and significantly reduced demand, many if not most will not be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Q1 numbers were worse than you think.\n\nQ1 saw a 4.8% GDP drop, despite a positive January &amp; February. If January and February had positive GDP growth, then the March drop was proportionally equivalent to a 15-19% contraction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Analyst Q2 GDP projections are too optimistic\n\nA complete shut down of our economy has never happened before. Analysts are claiming a \\~20%+ GDP drop. It will be greater than that by as much as 10 percentage points based on unprecedented negative economic reflexivity, which is not addressed in any of these analyst models. It strains credulity to believe that people will flock to restaurants, theme parks, travel locations, community centers, festivals, concerts, sports games, etc in droves. \n\nIn fact, I think every large gathering will have low attendance and the companies that host events as their main business may find themselves without sufficient revenue to continue operations. This effect will lead to declines in revenue for many different other industries and businesses directly and indirectly. The many small businesses which profit from events, fairs, and festivals rely on a certain amount of revenue to pay for their spot at the event. These businesses will largely be defunct. \n\nOnce people decide to venture out, they'll be unable to spend at pre-covid levels due to massive unemployment. Fear will set in as revenues decline. Investment sentiment will turn negative, and low interest rates won't even be able to keep asset prices from crashing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# White collar layoffs are next\n\nPeople making \\~$250k-$1M+ at Fortune 500 firms are taking 20-50% salary reductions. Global businesses with domestic headquarters are first laying off their employees abroad, and next they will start trimming operations domestically. That's the word. On face value, it appears bullish, due to lower labor costs, but instead it shows weakness in these firms and will lead to overall declines in demand across the broad economy. There will be many companies that will find their business in shambles in this quarter, which will drag down the indexes, even if a handful sectors happen to perform well by Q2 earnings at the latest. Although, news in the interim may accelerate the timeline. \n\nCompanies with recurring revenues sourced from customers with inelastic demand, such as pharmaceutical firms and military contractors will do fine for a while, but will eventually fall as well due to high p/e relative to other income producing assets and equities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nA nationwide economic shutdown, in the manner it has been done, is like stopping a truck by running it into a wall. Large swathes of the economy have been effectively destroyed. They will have to be completely rebuilt. Demand will drop significantly for years. Employment will likely increase higher even after the economy is reopened.",

        "selftext": "**Vague Statements**\n\nSo many technical analysts talk like the Oracle at Delphi.  \"These are interesting levels to look at\" or \"This day/week/month is going to be really pivotal!\"\n\nUmm okay?  What in the fuck does that mean?  How does any of that possibly generate any trade-able insight?  Of course, it's not meant to, its purpose is to make the person sound like a wise timeless sage.  Oh how brilliant are the technical analysts that can easily discern \"interesting\" levels!\n\n**Weasel language**\n\nAnother favorite tool of technical analysts.  Saying what 'could' happen instead of what 'will' happen.  Write a long diatribe about how the current level **could** be either resistance **or** support.  Wait awhile until an up trend or down trend is clearly visible, then point to your useless piece of shit writing and say, \"you see?  What did I tell you!\"\n\n**Unfalsifiable claims**\n\nThis is a big one.  Any sleazy snake oil salesman worth his salt knows to make unfalsifiable claims.  Never ever talk about what **will** happen or even what is **probable**, but only what the **potential** is.  \"If things break down here, there is potential for further downside\" or \"Potentially, this could be massive support. Let's see what happens.\"\n\nOn the rare occasion where technical analysts go out on a limb, they always have an excuse at the ready, such as:\n\n* Technical analysis is about probability, nothing is 100%.\n* The pattern wasn't subsequently \"confirmed\".\n* There were unforseen factors.  Fuck you Fed! (When everyone and their grandma can see the continual Fed balance sheet expansion).\n* Hey man, you always have to set your stops.  \n* I was mistaken, it happens, but technical analysis works and look at all these (cherry picked) predictions that I (vaguely) got right!\n\n**Survivorship Bias**\n\nTechnical analysts **love** to bring up things that they got 'correct'.  \"Hey I told you that could be support and look at the rally since!\".  When someone is selectively bringing up their past record, they almost always leave out the ones they got dead wrong.  For example, every single month, post a quarter about how you're 'skeptical' of the market, that a collapse in equity prices is 'in the cards', and then after the 27th article, when there is finally a significant decline, make sure to bring up that article from now until kingdom fucking come.  Pin that article to the top of your twitter feed or link to it on reddit.  Doesn't matter if it took you 20 accounts to get a spectacular prediction right, people will follow a 2 week old account like lemmings.  \n\n**Analysis in Hindsight**\n\nThis by far, is imo the most annoying.  Many technical analysts, with the benefit of hindsight, like to opine about how past moves were oh so obvious well after the fact.  Whether this is done to intentionally mislead people or is the genuine expression of someone with delusional faith in magic lines can only be determined on a case by case basis, largely depending on whether or not they are selling a subscription service.  They will rarely, if ever, talk about how \"obvious\" a move **will** be but will drone on endlessly about how obvious **past** moves are.  \n\nI will say one thing about the fucking jackasses that post on loss threads with comments like \"duhhhhh you couldn't see the future!  How stupid!\": at least they are not sleazy scam artists.",

Beginning in March MicroVision started earning a royalty on each component shipped that was approximately equal to the gross profit it earned on each component it had previously produced. \n\nAround the same exact time, Microsoft started expanding production capabilities for its Hololens in order to meet higher demands for the product. \n\nAnd to follow that up, the Army which is currently planing to equip its first units with the Integrated Visual Augmentation System toward the end of next year, thanked Microsoft for the expanded commitment to meet production demands. \n\n\u201cOur Microsoft partners have been outstanding in reforming the supply chain where necessary and continuing on with the development in their production and manufacturing facility in California\u201d \n\nAnd if the dots aren\u2019t connecting enough, immediately after this on April 6th, MicroVision stated their first clue of possibly entering a buyout of some sort. \u201cAs we reported on March 11, we are actively engaged with multiple interested parties to evaluate various opportunities to license our IP as well as other strategic alternatives.\u201d \n\nWhile no one knows for sure if MicroVision\u2019s technology is in the Hololens, there have been some confirming reports stating that may be the case (found under Hybrid Arrive section). \n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\u2019s Possible Expanded Use of MicroVision (MVIS) Technology \nThe connection between MicroVision and Microsoft is almost undeniable when it comes to the Hololens reports and timelines. But an additional use of their tech may change everything. \n\n\n\nThere are rumors and evidence that Microsoft is using MicroVision technology in their new expanded capability with the Xbox. Microsoft expanding their use of MicroVision technology can show us their interest and commitment to the technology, and also validate why they might think about buying MicroVision out. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Microsoft announced an Xbox Series X gameplay reveal event for Thursday, May 7, the same day as MicroVisions conference call.

        "selftext": "The fundamentals and the \u201cfeel\u201d of the markets are broken right now. Just like Goldman Sachs announced yesterday (5/11/2020), I think that there is a very good chance of a second crash coming to the markets.\n\nSo far, I trust my gut. I've been correct many, many times so far. In early January, I knew the market was coming down. On February 3rd, I even made a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRmJPgljdG4) to sell stonks. I got laughed at.\n\nTurns out, a few weeks later exactly what I said would occur happened. Early March, Markets Crashed \\~30%. Based on a text I sent on Sunday, March 22, I said \u201cI don\u2019t see it dropping much further.\u201d I came to this conclusion because I got news alerts that \u201cPowell: Federal Reserve Pledges Unlimited Quantitative Easing to Keep Markets Functioning\u201d and gut feeling the CARES ACT was nearing from drafting to negotiation phase. I bought, and told people to buy now.\n\nEnough humble bragging. As soon as this happened, the FED bailed out the market. **RULE #1**: DON'T FIGHT THE FED.\n\nAnyway, the next day (Monday, March 23rd) the Fed did come in. Since that day, the Markets have \u201crecovered\u201d.\n\nThe markets are going to experience a second dip. Since early April, I\u2019ve expected a \u201cW\u201d recovery rather than a \u201cV\u201d, \u201cU\u201d or \u201c\u221a\u201d recovery. Every day we move on, the more confident I become. Here are some reasons I predict a second dip:\n\n1. States will issue a second lockdown phase. High chance this may happen very soon (people freak out over confirmed cases/deaths next week as there is a 2week incubation period) or a spike in the fall. Prediction: 50%.\n2. The shutdown is dragged out way too long. States are crazy enough to extend until mid June. Who\u2019s gonna stop them from shifting the goalposts into August, November, 2021? I see draconian states being crazy enough to do this. Prediction: 100%.\n3. People will realize unemployment numbers are not \u201ctemporary\u201d, but permanent. The market seems to expect a quick bounce in the unemployment numbers, but I truly do not think this will happen. Prediction: 95%.\n4. Consumer spending/demand does not return. I see Q2 financial reports being a much bigger dumpster fire than predicted. April is expected to be bad, but May and June are expected to be a return to normal. I do not see this. Prediction: 80%.\n\nWith one of these  or a mix of these happening, I see a second dip in July/August.\n\nWhat will cause this second dip to recover? The Fed. Markets will keep falling, until then they drop \\~20% and the Fed comes back again.\n\nI predict the Fed will announce negative interest rates. President Trump wants this so badly, and it's one of the most powerful tools the Fed has to pump the market. I don\u2019t even think the market needs to dip again for this to happen in the near future.\n\nI predict this will happen before the election. (September/October). Once this happens, there is no stopping how high stocks will go. As the great Warren Buffett says \u201cInterest rates are like gravity in valuation. If interest rates are nothing, values can be almost infinite. If interest rates are extremely high, that's a huge gravitational pull on value\u201d.\n\nGet those financial news apps installed on your phone ASAP. Fox Business, CNBC, etc. I DON'T CARE. Even if my prediction of a second dip is wrong, as soon as you hear that the Fed announces negative interest rates, go ALL IN. I won't tell you what stocks to buy, but as I said before: **DON'T FIGHT THE FED**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;in before \"this guy is full of shit\". I'm just writing my prediction",

        "selftext": "A lot of traders like to make fun of this mentality. They say \u201cset your stop losses tight, get out if it goes against you two ticks and move on.\u201d This is a glue-guzzling retarded thing to say and I\u2019m about to tell you why. \n\nBefore you say \u201cOh they\u2019re professional traders, they know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d do me a favor and shut the fuck up. This is the market that\u2019s on it\u2019s way to ATH. We\u2019ve seen companies do the exact opposite of what they should do. STNG came out and made earnings their bitch and lost 10% in one day because the algos saw a downward dog trendline and a negative 50SMA. HOG came out and said they have no customers, no money, and no idea when they\u2019ll make money again and they popped 20%. \n\nIf you start with an account of $1000 and make a stupid play, you might lose 80%. Say you invested in literally anything on march 23rd. However, if you decided to be retarded like Warren Buffett and sell at rock bottom, you would have a portfolio that\u2019s worth 20% of what you started with. Why not sell and move into a different play? Because for you to take that $200 back to $1000, you would need 500% gains in a comparable amount of time as it would take for your original security to recover. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no chance that the original security will recover fully!\u201d Fucking wrong. Unless it\u2019s Luckin Coffee or some other radioactive dogshit, we\u2019ve seen time and again that stocks are only gonna go straight fuckin up for the next infinity years. Long after humans are gone algos are gonna be trading the last securities back and forth with digital money. \n\n\u201cThis is WSB, options or ban.\u201d Someone rack this faggot. I\u2019ve been on WSB for years and shares have always been part of the play. Especially right now, with IV insanely high, option premiums are through the roof and nothing is moving the way you expect it to. Buy shares in something with a low RSI, wait till it pops, and sell that shit. If it goes down, pretend its fucking bitcoin and hold it. \n\n If you wanna bitch and moan about only making 30% on a play, go to your all-time record on Robinhood and remind yourself that you\u2019re down 94% all time and you would suck a bleeding hobo dick for 10% gains. Take your favorite lipstick and write \u201cYOU ARE NOT FUCKING SMART ENOUGH FOR A TEN BAGGER\u201d on your mirror until you learn to walk away from the table with 15% in a week. \n\n\nTL;DR buy shares, hold them till they go up, sell them, repeat. If they don\u2019t go up, don\u2019t fucking sell them, and maybe your kids will sell for a gain. \n\nPositions: STNG, DHT, GLOG, UIS, INFY, MPLX.",

        "selftext": "Those DD posts all spammed yesterday. So much evidence the stock is going higher.\n\n-12% today.\n\nGreat work guys. DD is another way of saying \"I have no idea what I'm doing, so I'll rationalize why my trade will work.\" The mob of reddit upvotes it, because they're clueless, and now you got yourself a bunch of new bagholders.\n\nPerhaps it's a good thing these traders lose. Buying long on some of these companies, just downright stupid. \n\nStupid money is good. While it's sometimes painful to read the overwhelming amount of bullshit on this subreddit, every now and then something new comes along. Nowadays, we have the next hype stock posted daily. It's comical. \n\nHere's each point broken down:\n\n**Recklessly long-biased**\n-\n\n99.85% of all posts on here are long biased \"hot stock picks.\" I suspect many traders wouldn't be long if they had the choice. Unfortunately, robinhood and most mainstream brokers don't have the shares to borrow. So, instead of admitting it's impossible to profit long-term by swinging these pumps long, these traders double down. Like playing slots, they are always the losers, because they don't even know they are playing against the house.\n\n**Incompetent**\n-\n\nEver notice how each stock pick, those hype picks that you see on the front page, always fail? They always drop, even after a week. Those, like myself, who bring up the fact they fail, are met with usual replies:\n\n* You need to sell sooner rather than later\n\n* I bought before the pump even started\n\n* Gibberish about how the company is great\n\n* I'm a bad person for even suggesting the idea they'll fail\n\nNow all these vapid arguments all have one thing in common, the person has a vested interest in the stock. It's pretty amusing, because they create posts that are entirely emotion based. Some are more clever. Emotional based posts under the auspices of \"DD.\" I'll get to why this subreddits \"DD\" is nothing more than confirmation bias.\n\n**Shockingly uniformed**\n-\n\nNewbie traders, who admit they're new, should be given the benefit of the doubt. Although, newbies helping newbies create more newbie decisions, perhaps this is a bad cycle. While I can't prove it, sometimes there are manipulative forces that jump into subreddits like this. They mask themselves as \"arbiters of preforming proper DD.\" These people are nothing more than newsletter frauds, who have blended in to almost seem real. \n\nRead into astroturfing.\n\nEver notice how many DD posts contain a laundry list of reasons why a company is a good buy. Where is that short-biased DD? One side of the trade is correct, so perhaps there's more to it then \"microsoft may have a stake in it.\" Ironically, if you keep track of these hype stocks posted on here, all that DD is laughable. Re-read a few from a couple months ago. Check where those stocks ended up. \n\n**Never profitable long term**\n-\n\nOver the past 5 years, I've seen this subreddit grow into something pretty insane. A new stocktwits has formed. Pumpers, gullible sheep, and the occasional good trader make up the population on here. I remember posting similar things 5 years ago. These traders, who were confident in their positions at the time, would fire back at my contrarian arguments by saying my arguments are wrong. How many of these traders survived?\n\nNone.\n\nNone of those accounts, over 100 traders, survived.... except myself. I was short-biased, they were long-biased. Wave after wave, month after month, newbie traders are flushed out. Gullible traders, otherwise known as sheep, are the first ones to blow up. They are the slot machine players. The buyers into these hype stocks creating \"DD\" as a mask for their confirmation bias. \n\nCMV.",

        "selftext": " Alright autists and retards, everybody has been losing money on tankers this last week but I have news for you: your weak hands are the only reason you are losing money on tankers.\n\nIt may be a surprise to everyone under the age of 14 that the situation the tanker industry is in has happened twice in the past decade. There is a strong correlation between the oil contango and the market price of tanker stocks.\n\nAs you can see here from Euronav's investor update in April\n\n[https://imgur.com/UFgjZa5](https://imgur.com/UFgjZa5)\n\nNow that I have shown that the two are related let's take a look at the contango history:\n\n[https://imgur.com/e4Jwn76](https://imgur.com/e4Jwn76)\n\nLet's compare that to the stock price history of say STNG, NAT, ASC, FRO, and DHT:\n\n[https://imgur.com/iruMQGf](https://imgur.com/iruMQGf)\n\nIn 2008 and 2015 when the oil contango was at its highest (UNTIL NOW) these stocks were at 5-10 times what they are valued at now. It is important to note that the contango spike precedes the tanker stock price by about 6 months. But how is the contango rising compared to 2008? much faster and steadier ([https://imgur.com/oz4DplY](https://imgur.com/oz4DplY) ) What I am saying now is that these stocks are apollo 11 and you still have a chance to jump on the shuttle.\n\nLooking at earnings reports from STNG and DHT we see that they nearly made as much as the entire fiscal year of 2018 IN ONE QUARTER. No link cause I'm lazy and you people need to learn to do your own DD.\n\nSo everyone knows that the spot price is for these ships is up to as much as $110,000 (or at least you should know this because its over twice the standard rate and is RIDICULOUS) but what does that mean. Looking at ACG earnings report (I picked this one to show because its the most clear and easy to read) we can see \"Any increase in TCE goes fully to the bottom line, with every $10,000 / day increase in TCE adding approximately $90 million in earnings and cashflow annually.\"\n\nfrom ASC's highlights in the earnings report: [https://imgur.com/FNXyDMC](https://imgur.com/FNXyDMC)\n\nSo lets say they only are making $20,000 more per day per ship (its much more) and lets pick a small company like ACG that has a very small fleet of 20 tankers. That's a lot of tendies.\n\nWhat's the risk?

        "selftext": " I pasted [the article](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/05/07/the-market-v-the-real-economy), to exempt you from registering an account to read it.\n\n##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give\n\nSTOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.\n\nThis rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms\u2019 shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.\n\nWounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. \u201cThis is the second time we\u2019ve bailed their asses out,\u201d grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.\n\nStart with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield \u201cjunk\u201d bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.\n\nThe Fed has little choice\u2014a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket\u2019s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.\n\nTellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft\u2014which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.\n\nAt one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.\n\nThe first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with\u2014American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.\n\nA second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets\u2019 confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors\u2019 nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.\n\nThe most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.\n\nFor now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.\u25a0",

Who doesn't want that? Well if you do I have the play for you! First let's catch you up to speed on this 2 week old post, which if you would have followed me, you to would be enjoying over 800% gains at this point.\n\n[Original DD Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ifvr/cornerstone_ondemand_csdo_dd_undervalued_gem_in_a/)\n\n**but wait there's more!**\n\n&gt; Private reports of the SABA acquisition in relation to CSOD's overall revenue forecast a 25-33% increase, this will officially be detailed in Q1 earnings report.\n\n&gt; SABA has a very large clientele base which is apt for cross-selling $CSOD's exisiting products\n\n&gt; CSOD is mostly institutional buys. They are looking for safe-havens in this risky environment, $CSOD has a HUGE cash flow. Cash is king in a recession. They are also primarily catering to essential employees, their cash flow will not be as affected. SABA acquisition also represents a large percentage increase in free cash flow.\n\n&gt; CSOD already has most of its annualized returns locked in due to contracts and will be able to provide stable, if not forward-looking guidance.\n\n&gt; [Please see this additional comment DD, holy fucking shit just buy calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ifvr/cornerstone_ondemand_csdo_dd_undervalued_gem_in_a/folrklv/)\n\nSo what we have here is a undervalued, heavily hit company during the crash which has yet to make it's checkmark recovery like so many other stocks. What's difference?\n\nWell people are now finally realizing how strong the tech sector is, and how valuable remotely-engaged businesses will be in the future. This pandemic just caused a paradigm shift in how humans will work in the future, companies like $CSOD will profit from this immensely in the next 2-4 quarters which investors will EAT UP.\n\nNow let me answer some questions that I frequently see...\n\n&gt; *hurr durrr I saw the executives selling shares?* well yeah no shit, they were about to announce an acquisition which usually tanks share prices short-term. The next time they sold was the actual market crash, who wouldn't?\n\n&gt; *but what if this is another NET?* $CSOD is still significantly down from its share price before the crash and acquisition. Once we see how the new acquisition will help CSOD in the medium-term, institutions will be eating this stock up for its MASSIVE FREE CASH FLOW. Also this is mostly institutional buyers, this ain't a meme stock (except now it is...)\n\n&gt; *how are you sure they beat?* if you take a look at the current expectations for Q1, they are relatively low in a quarter where all of America, and the World was sent into lockdown resulting in a MASSIVE shift to online-based learning, trainings and work. I believe they beat handily and their SABA acquisition models are icing on the cake for the BREAKOUT OF THE CENTURY.\n\n&gt; *is it to late to join the party?* no but you now have to account for IV, don't pick retardly OTM 5/15 calls, stick to 6/19s at strikes $40 or $42.5, maybe $45 for a daytrade.\n\n&gt; *when are you selling?* I bet my short-term livelihood on this play, I can't leave it all on the table and will take some profits EOD Monday. I will be remaining in a $5k-$7.5k long-term play for earnings. Literally I bet my savings on this shit.\n\nI am glad my first $DD has been so profitable for so many, and I hope it continues to pay y'all out, it sure has for me. I can't wait to see what is in store on Monday night. What's next? Find out this weekend on another edition of Baked Morning.\n\nGood luck, and may your portfolio finally go green.\n\nTLDR: avoid IV, stick with June 19 $37.50c / $40c / $42.50c as many as you can buy.",

        "selftext": "Daily overview heading into the US open. The US options market opens in about 2 hours from now. Futures are up. [Prices trade on resistance](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gehuxi/were_now_back_to_2890_spx/). Our outlook for the day is bearish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day opportunity rank: 1**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExpected opening action:\n\nSPX is trading 2890 in the futures market.  Prices making a double top in this area would signal a  downtrend through the day most likely.  I expect to see the market continue to  fall in the coming couple of hours and the US open  to be lower than the current price.  My estimate  at this point is a  low around 2865 - 2860.\n\nIf we see prices falling a bit in futures and then breaking under this level our best bet for the day is probably going to be found around the retest of the 2880 area. Here we can buy puts and use moderate strikes  of 2865 - 2860 or aggressive strikes of 2845.  This is a level where I want to take daily, weekly and monthly options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risk assessment of the day;**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBullish risk:\n\nTo gain any sort of control over the market the bulls have to be able to take the 2890 area.  Above the 2899 level the bulls could have a firmer grip on the market until at lest 2910.  All risk today should be confined to under the 2890 level.  2899 is the stop loss level on the day.  As the market trades right now, I think the bull risk is low,  and lower still if we fall to  2865 sort of level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRange risk:\n\nI think  today has a very low probability of being a ranging day. I do think the market can range for a while around the 2890 price point, and I'd not expect to see this for more than 8 - 9 hours. We've been there around 6 hours now and I think (at least one way or the other) a break of the range is due and a trending day will follow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it is very likely some sort of news that will start to make the market very volatile is due some time in the coming days or week ahead. Today we have a big opportunity to position ourselves for this. Taking quite a low  risk entry that we can cut loss on quickly if need be, and get in to the trades before the premiums rocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n\\----\n\nOptions trading can be very profitable but is also something that can have a lot of (especially short-term) variance. To trade options without any losses is impossible and even profitable options trading strategies are going to experience some runs of losing trades. Here are some risk awareness points anyone considering options trades based upon ideas and information posted here;\n\nDaily options 3 times rule:\n\nDaily options can produce either reasonable or exceptional gains in a small period of time. The right option on the right day is worth a fortune, but these are also the trades most likely to produce losses. When taking daily options it's best to adopt a mindset of being willing to lose the option on three attempts if required. That's not to say risk everything over three bets, it's to say bet an amount you can lose 3 times and still be fine to take other trades later.\n\nOpportunity Ranks;\n\nThere is always the option to trade, but the best opportunities to trade come along far more infrequently. Many days and weeks or trading will not present extremely high probability options trades. Using smaller bets during times when the market is offering lower odds (which is most of the time) allows for the riding of more ups and downs in losses while waiting for clearer opportunities. At times when more things line up to support the trade, it makes more sense to bet bigger on these. These are rarer opportunities.\n\nMarket conditions will be ranked as being low (3), medium (2) or high (1) probability. High probability rankings do not remove the requirement or usefulness of the three times rule. Often a big move is going to happen, but getting it on the nose first time is difficult. Hedging and Protecting Positions; It is best to ensure there is capital available to place hedge trades against options you have open if required. This should be considered before opening any trades.\n\nEverything here's educational only. You have to make your own decisions",

        "selftext": "Like what do they plan on doing with the trillions of assets that they have absorbed in the past month?  Are they just gonna hold this dogshit on their books until the end of time?  What about all the junk bonds and ETFs BlackRock has been buying up?  Where do these go?  In an ideal world, they would slowly be introduced back into the market once the market is \"standing on it's own\" again, whatever the fuck that means. \n\nExcept I don't think this is possible. [From 2008 to 2014, the Fed radically increased their balance sheet](https://thesoundingline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Balance-Sheet-of-the-Federal-Reserve-Total-Assets-1914-through-May-6th-2020.png) and only after **9 years** were they even able *to begin* to sell off a fraction of these holdings. \n\nNow here they are *again* holding the fucking bag that's looking to be multiples bigger.  If they even mention the possibility of selling this dogshit, the market is gonna crash.  So what's the plan? Is there even a plan?  I haven't seen this mentioned once and I'm hoping the wsb hivemind can soothe my fears.  \n\nMy personal opinion is they will inflate the mother of all bubbles to stave off a crash for possibly a few years which will crush all the bears\u2019 hopes.  By then, the balance sheet will be around 10-12 trillion and rates will be a 25 bps negative.  At this point, the Fed will *actually be out of ammo*.  When the next disruption hits, I'm not really sure what they can do from there.  That's when the mother of all crashes happens and it's probably guns and ammo time.  For a brief moment you'll be rich on your shitty RH account until you're gunned down shortly after by roving gangs.  The level of irresponsibility we're seeing is truly unrivaled.  They are playing with our economy like it literally can't go tits up which makes me fear for the worst.  Or maybe i'm retarded like [this guy](https://media3.giphy.com/media/G8ebH5TOE3pde/source.gif).\n\nWait for us to hit 315 and then go in on some SPY 180 P 2022 strike",

        "selftext": "# tl; dr\n\nSeriously, just go away.  If you can't be bothered to read for 5 minutes before putting money on something, you don't belong here.   You're not an autist; you're just a full blown retard.\n\nWhat you should do first is go read the post where I called the price of the stock pre-earnings and as a great [COVID Recovery Play: PRPL to $12-$14 by 5/12 and $20-$24 by end of Q1 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g30vst/covid_recovery_play_prpl_to_1214_by_512_and_2024/)**.**\n\nAfter that, you need to go read how I predicted the beat on earnings consensus over the weekend here:   [Purple (PRPL) Earnings is Monday After Hours: Here's What to Expect](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggp2vx/purple_prpl_earnings_is_monday_after_hours_heres/)**.**\n\nOnly after reading and understanding those two things will you be capable of making tendies as described below because you will actually know what you are doing.\n\nIf I've already exceeded your maximum word count, go back to reading the memes on the sub so you can cool your overheated brain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote:  all quotes below are paraphrased from the earnings call.  I am not transcribing that thing.\n\n# 2020 Q1 Earnings Release\n\nEarnings could not have gone better.  PRPL is literally a brand new business that should catch your eye for investment.  I am solidly in the $19+ camp [from my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggp2vx/purple_prpl_earnings_is_monday_after_hours_heres/) based upon results and the guidance given.   You can still make tendies on this play because PRPL builds its price action over time, which I will cover below.   Let's look at some numbers first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Consensus|Actuals|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|$106.97M|$122.4M|\n|EPS|$0.05|$0.11|\n\nA solid beat on Revenue, EPS, EBITDA and Adj. EBITDA.   Just an amazing quarter, but the historical isn't the best part.   The forward looking is ***amazing***.  Before we get into that, a few more numbers that matter.\n\n**Receivables**\n\nPRPL has a large wholesale business which means it has significant exposure to bad debts due to retail brick and mortar locations closing and retailers who are obviously cash starved.   Joe told us on the call  that their wholesale accounts are \"largely current on their receivables\" and Purple is \"continuing to get paid almost entirely across the board\".\n\nAwesome.  This means very little bad debt and the revenue earned will convert to cash.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nYeah, I called this one.   It was material to the shift in EPS, but you are an idiot if you care.   This stuff is equity and should be treated as equity.   Yes, GAAP requires otherwise, but the FASB doesn't always make the best decisions.\n\n**Supply Chain**\n\n&gt;Our supply chain has not as yet been significantly affected by COVID-19. Currently, our domestic suppliers are able to continue operations and provide necessary materials when needed. Suppliers in China were temporarily closed as a result of the pandemic but we had sufficient inventory on hand. Many of our suppliers resumed production in March and are able to supply materials as needed. As a result, we don\u2019t expect supply to have a material impact on our ability to meet anticipated demand.\n\nThere you have it.  Pretty much no supply chain risk.\n\n# Forward Looking Guidance\n\nPRPL did not provide formal guidance for the rest of the year, but the rest of the year is what they mostly talked about on the call, and the management team clearly wanted you to understand April with their \"[Second Quarter Preview](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx)\".  Let's look at what they said.\n\n**Cash**\n\nThey ended Q1 with $26.4M in cash (down from Q4's $33.5M in cash); however, **they ended April with $62.5M in cash**!  Management really wanted to call it out so they put the April cash number at the top with all of the Q1 numbers on the earnings release, which I thought was funny.  In reality, they've done a fantastic job at managing expenses and converting inventory on hand into cash during the quarter.   This should give you quite a bit of confidence in the management team.  This is probably more cash on hand than they have ever had, which means they are well weathered to not just manage this storm (which is a storm that is cash flow positive for them), but to invest ahead of the competition for the future.\n\n**Hiring and Capacity**\n\nJoe confirmed that \"the furlough is all but over\" and Purple is \"actually in hiring mode right now to bring people in fairly aggressively\" in order to expand capacity.   According to Joe, \"***demand has not waned at all***\".  Purple is still selling very near capacity (they brought a new machine online and are expanding their hiring aggressively to fill the capacity).\n\nPRPL announced previously, as a result of COVID, that they were deferring all capital expenditures.They've now done a 180 on that statement.  PRPL is accelerating the completion of the Max 7 machine in order to increase capacity another 20% over last year, which should be done this quarter.  The Max 8 &amp; 9 machines are still happening, but because they are being built in their new east coast manufacturing facility, it is unknown whether they will get them done this year.\n\nIf you have been paying attention to my previous posts, you will remember that ***the Max 8 &amp; 9 machines were not necessary to meet the pre-COVID guidance*** provided for the year.  This is part of why ***PRPL is going to beat their original pre-COVID guidance this year***.  Read on.\n\n**Wholesale Sales**\n\nWholesale is down dramatically.  Duh.  85% of wholesale doors were closed during April, but they have seen through April that sequential wholesale orders have been increasing.   **Believe it or not, we are happy for wholesale to stay closed longer for PRPL.**   What!?!   Yep.  We'll get into that more in a second, but let's talk about the hedge to revenue that wholesale provides.\n\nI strongly inferred in a previously post that PRPL can simply expand wholesale doors to make up for lost same store sells.   Joe just came out and said it on the call:  if wholesale sales are slow to recover on a same store basis, the could just expand to more doors.\n\nAdditionally, their wholesale partners burned through their safety stock of Purple mattresses.  As wholesale doors are opening up, large orders are coming in to restock their inventory.  The trend for wholesale remains to be seen as doors reopen and Memorial Day weekend comes in.  Wholesale doors are achieving up to 85% of demand at most right now and this is a good thing.\n\nThis means our worst case scenario is that PRPL will meet their pre-COVID guidance for the year by simply expanding wholesale doors.  The hedge.\n\n**Direct to Consumer Sales**\n\nTHIS is why PRPL is going to BEAT their pre-COVID guidance for the year.  I'm calling it now.\n\nApril DTC sales were up 170% YoY for the full month.   170%!!!  Not only that, Joe explained that:\n\n&gt;It has been remarkebly consistent.   Briefly saw DTC retract at the end of March.  PRPL saw pretty consistent DTC performance at the beginning of April, but a retraction in wholesale as stores shut down.  ***About the time the stimulus checks hit, we saw a pretty significant increase in our DTC business***\\*\\*.\\*\\*   We did some surveying and we don't think its entirely related to the stimulus checks themselves, but really some sentiment and people settle into the new normal. Since that time, ***we've seen a consistent but eleveated performance on DTC***.  It has really be pretty remarkable on how consistent it has been.\n\nThis means the run rate exiting April was greater than 170% YoY for DTC (if the average of 170% includes half the month at a lower rate).   Joe told us that this is more than offsetting the decline in wholesale.\n\nPRPL will beat pre-COVID guidance for the quarter and for the year because:\n\n* They have a new Mattress Max machine as of the beginning of the quarter (20% increase over last year's unit manufacturing capacity)\n* They are still selling everything they can make.\n* They receive greater revenue and margin from every DTC unit relative to wholesale.\n\nTherefore, we will see a revenue and earnings beat for the next quarter and likely the rest of the year.\n\nPRPL management believes that unit demand never disappeared and that they've seen a shift of demand from their brick and mortar partners to online (which means PRPL makes more money per mattress).\n\nAdditionally, they've seen a decline in marketing acquisition costs as many competitors are struggling and overall advertising costs are dropping nationwide.  The acquistion model online is much more simple than attempting to spend to get people to go into stores (for anyone who understands modern digital marketing, these means they will be able to scale their spend and revenue justifiably easier and faster).  New customers as a % of all customers (in terms of traffic and purchases) has gone up as they have been able to cast a wider net digitally and had a higher conversion rate.\n\nJoe's words about the boost in revenue caused by the shift to DTC are:  \"it is distorting revenue up\".   Joe, this is going to distort the stock price up too.\n\nLastly, Joe stated very clearly their plans for wholesale reopening offsetting DTC revenue in their manufacturing constrained world:  \"they would throttle their wholesale growth until they could continue to expand their capacity\".  DTC for the win!\n\n**A slow return to normal will benefit Purple by boosting per unit revenue and margin.**\n\nLike I said, this is a brand new business.\n\n# Forward Looking Price Action - More Tendies!\n\nThere are still opportunities to make tendies with PRPL tomorrow and over the next quarter.  Here is why.\n\n**PRPL Builds Price Momentum**\n\nBecause PRPL is a mid-market stock with not a lot of following and mid-market volume, its price actions are not immediate.  The typical pattern after earnings is that the price adjustment builds slowly over the next day to whatever direction earnings dictates.   Then, the price action continues to build over the next quarter.  Look at the price action after the Q3 2019 earnings call if you want the most pronounced example of this.\n\nWherever we start tomorrow, I'll bet money that we end much higher.\n\n**PRPLW Lag**\n\nPRPLW warrants do not behave like your typical CBOE options where market makers have algorithms changing the bid/ask on every strike with every movement of the stock.   Typical market makers accept those prices at every level because they are delta hedging with your play.\n\nPRPLW warrants are OTC and there is no options chain currently, which means not a whole lot of market making.   While this makes them less liquid, it also means that PRPLW warrants typically lag the price of PRPL stock on the way up as you are trading against other people.   Plenty of scalping opportunities on big price movement days if you know what you are doing.   If you don't know, it means you can usually get a good deal if you buy into a longer-term hold.\n\n**Short Interest**\n\nSHORT INTEREST INCREASED!!!  The 4/30 numbers are out tonight and short interest increased a whopping 33.5%!   That means we have a short float of 10.72%.\n\nIf you recall my weekend post,  only 16.44% of float is left with non-institutionals.   Those 2,439,121 short shares are going to get squeezed.   The shorts got hurt today with ER and they are going to want to slowly exit their position over the next day or so, which is another reason why we may see momentum in the stock tomorrow.   If there is a push behind it, we may see a much more dramatic squeeze.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqo6ilxgv8y41.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bcdb6ded74c2d3281d7a98717e11aad72e17975\n\nWe still saw a significant amount of short volume through today.  As the stock gaps up, margin calls are going to happen.   As shorts cover and new buyers buy in, this will accelerate.   Depending on your broker, margin calls could have days to cover, which means we will see upward pressure over a few days.\n\n**Press Coverage**\n\nPRPL is still not a well known stock.  It will likely get some better press coverage over the next few days for two reasons:\n\n1. It slaughtered earnings better than most companies this season.\n2. Casper, a media darling, reports tomorrow morning.\n\nIt is Casper's first earnings release since IPOing.   Whether or not it is a disaster, most reporters will start drawing comparisons to PRPL.   More visibility through the day tomorrow and weeks to come will drive further new investment as people start to understand what is happening here.\n\n**Index Additions**\n\nPRPL gapping up and growing will only increase the number of indexes it gets added to and therefore funds that are required to buy in.   More cash investment required over the next few months will only support a growing stock price.\n\n**Great Fundamentals**\n\nLastly, this stock had great fundamentals before this huge earnings beat, and fundamentals always win in the long run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck tomorrow and let's get some tendies!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Positions\n\nI have one share of PRPL.   I made $2 on it today and am up $1.91 since open.   In great wsb tradition, I'll probably do a gain post on that.\n\nThe PRPLW warrant prices don't update AH.   That's where I ended the day.   I had a steak dinner tonight to celebrate.   The wife tried to give me a chicken salad from Panera, but I wasn't having it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8xftnpzz8y41.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=005bd6c3156a79eeab3d4ec007858cb6efb94c73",

        "selftext": "Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 5/2-5/4. I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem \"important\" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst things first. Remember that we are reading *Money; A Suicide Note* for the [WSB Books event](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g85inu/wsbooks_vol_1_money_a_suicide_note_4pm_et_516/). It can be bought (which is recommended) or [downloaded here](https://epdf.pub/money-a-suicide-note129e7b0df400a345810ae585631783a94603.html). It will download as a LIT file then upload it to [this site](https://anyconv.com/lit-to-pdf-converter/) and re-download as a PDF. This event is aimed at making everyone a better trader and having a little autistic fun at the same time.  Now for the DD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Z;**  Let's take a look at Zillow. They are an interesting company. This is an excerpt straight from their website;\n\n&gt;Zillow serves the full lifecycle of owning and living in a home: buying, selling, renting, financing, remodeling and more. It starts with Zillow's living database of more than 110 million U.S. homes - including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market\n\nThey are a big business raking in $2.7 billion in 2019. However, looking at [their 10-K](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/z#link_fullReport) from that same year shows a $300 million loss which is up about $180 million from 2018. That's not good. They are consistently spending much more than they bring in but somehow are still seen as a good company. Their debt also rose in 2019 from about $700 million in long term debt to a whopping $1.5 BILLION. All these numbers are straight from their 10-K (Feel free to thank me and thank u/fuzzyblankeet too for teaching me how to understand this shit). At the end of 2019 they had 2,707 homes in their inventory. \n\nNow you ask, \u201cWhat do we do with all these big numbers that I don't understand?\u201d, and I say, \u201cYou just fucking look at them.\u201d So here is what we can take away from this. This is a company that is consistently losing money, has more than doubled their debt in a year, and much of their asset value comes from owning 2,707 houses. What happens to the price of homes in a recession? It fucking drops\u2026 like a lot. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdbzyn/home_sales_to_fall_up_to_60/) goes over some basic stuff but more importantly it shows what they just released which is a statement saying it might take UNTIL 2021 TO RECOVER. Damn, that sucks. Earnings come out on 5/7 after close so puts for 5/15 because you can't sell options that expire that day. But more than that, this is a long term play too. Zillow will not do well in a recession and we haven't quite entered one yet. If you want, look far out for puts. Could be a smart thing especially given all this information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Next Leg Down;** For another explanation on why we are rising in the midst of a pandemic, read this post or read the last few lines right here;\n\n&gt;This entire bull rally has been fueled by new retail investors buying the dip, bringing the stock price to euphoric levels. Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve been seeing the people waiting at the sidelines for years to get into the stock market slowly FOMO into the rally in smaller and smaller volumes, while the smart money have been locking in their profits at an even slower rate - hence an ascending wedge. As the amount of new retail interest in the stock market started slowed down, the amount of new bulls started to decline. This doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll instantly go back to circuit breakers, we might see 282 -&gt; 274 -&gt; 284 -&gt; 274 happen before panic, this time by the first-time investors, eventually bringing us down.\n\nI cut a couple things out so this isn't a direct quote but it's what you need to understand. Millions of first time investors are \u201cbuying the dip\u201d and when they stop doing this in such large numbers then the real gravity of the situation we are in will hit. It will be all Uh-oh\u2019s and fuck-me\u2019s from then till we hit the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Oil Reminder;**  Oh and remember those tanker plays I recommended on the [4/9-4/13](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0nkrl/summary_of_dd_from_49413_insider_trading_oil/) post? Those fucking printed. So remember the [4/23-4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7f1m6/dd_from_423424_live_nation_oil_starbucks_and/) post I made about land based oil storage? Those are going to print too so get in while you can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unusual Activity;** This isn't a big thing for me but it may help a few of you.  CNX Resources (CNX) is an oil and gas company and their earnings were terrible. Here's what is interesting; there was 32K open interest for Jul 6P, 28k puts for Oct 5p, and only 10k calls for Oct. Isn't that a little strange. That a lot of volume for a small company, seems like someone knows something we don't. \n\nThen there is Wright Medical Group NV (WMGI) which makes medical devices like joint implants and bone fixation devices for the foot and ankle and some other shit. They have 10k Aug 25P, 10k Aug 30p, and less than 4k volume for every other month. Weird. Do what you want with this information. I don't plan to do anything with these and wont include them in the TLDR or Plays. Here is [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcgyg5/3_unusual_options_activity_from_last_week/) going into more detail about this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast thing, I plan to make an entire separate post detailing my strategy when doing earnings plays tomorrow.

        "selftext": "Yesterday a post about PTON caught my attention. It was by [/u/The\\_Big\\_Short\\_2020](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Big_Short_2020), a new account that had lost money on Blue Apron and zero previous winning trades. Naturally I was intrigued. He is going long with over 50k in calls into Peloton's earnings call on May 6th. IV is nuts at 190% for options due May 8th. The stock is up 19.7% in the past week. He owns one of their bikes, so you already know he is biased and brainwashed. Peloton is just like a cult. Beckies and sissies paying to ride an overpriced stationary bike. Never go against a cult stock, a lesson Tesla shorts forgot about. So I had to match his retardedness by going long 53k [https://imgur.com/a/my7JJXm](https://imgur.com/a/my7JJXm) . We will see if our cumulative 6 figure investment pays off. The following is the copy past of the his position and following that the DD he posted:\n\n  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdj3zw/holding\\_over\\_50k\\_of\\_pton\\_calls\\_ahead\\_of\\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdj3zw/holding_over_50k_of_pton_calls_ahead_of_earnings/) \n\nPeloton is growing rapidly - app downloads have grown tenfold. Their stock popped 5 percent when they announced that they had their largest live class (23,000 riders) over a week ago. Their previous largest live class was 19k the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nFYI - I just did a live class and there were 29k riders present; this is 20 percent higher than their previous record which again caused their stock to surge when announced - Pton chose not to announce this. Why? I\u2019m not sure, maybe saving the good news for earnings?\n\nIm also bullish after calling the peloton delivery man who set up my peloton in February. During the phone call I had with him in late March, he said that they are 3x busier than the Christmas season and that he\u2019s never seen demand like this during the two years he\u2019s been with peloton. Though anecdotal, this tells me the lead time (in my area at least) is caused by the unprecedented demand for the bike. Demand during spring is huge because typically this is Peloton\u2019s offseason. If they have christmas like demand for all of 2020, they will destroy their revenue guidance. Let\u2019s also not forget that peloton lowered their revenue guidance during their last earnings call on Feb 5th before this pandemic hit. They will absolutely crush this lowered guidance, that would have never been lowered if they knew Mother Nature was going to give them the most ideal pandemic for their business model.\n\nLastly PTON CEO John Foley said in 2018 that if peloton wanted to turn a profit, they could do so tomorrow. The reason they don\u2019t is because they want to aggressively capture market share which is why they spent nearly all their profit on commercials. Notice anything lately? Peloton hasn\u2019t been airing commercials because there is no need with demand outstripping Manufactuing. This cut in add spending, coupled with unprecedented demand will allow them to reach profitably much sooner - if they announce that they expect to be profitable in 2021 - two years earlier than planned - than this stock will fucking soar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nA lot of people see the treadmill cancellation as a negative but I\u2019ll argue it is a positive for two reasons:\n\n1) it is a lot larger and bulkier than the bikes. One treadmill takes the space of two bikes. Also the tread is a lot more time consuming to set up - even though Pton isn\u2019t stepping inside their customers houses, they still set up the equipment outside. Bikes only allow for a greater amount of deliveries at a more efficient rate per delivery.\n\n2) Pton has better margins on their bikes versus their treads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTDLR: Pton lowered revenue guidance in February - before the pandemic hit. If they had 20/20 vision they would have raised their guidance. Cuts in add spending, coupled with high demand will allow Pton to reach profitability MUCH sooner than originally believed. Their live rider class counts have grown over 20 percent WITHIN THE PAST WEEK. The cancellation of Pton treadmills allow for more deliveries and better margins. The guy who set up my Pton (I live in metro Detroit) told me that demand is Christmas x3 right now which tells me the long lead time is more likely caused by the spike in demand, rather than supply chain issues.",

        "selftext": "Hasn't the bull trap been fascinating to  watch?  What an incredible pendulum swing from the peak of pessimism in March to the wild splendour of predictions of the 'V' shaped recovery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBull charge headfirst into red flags, and bear hibernate.  Here we are in the weekend of the first week of May, people's businesses are folding, renters demanding rent breaks, landlords sweating over insolvency and heart attacks just lost top spot in killer diseases to the most contagious virus any of us have ever seen in our lives; but none of this matter.

The market *did break.* Just because people jumped in to short too early and have been getting roughed up 'Fighting the Fed' it does not change anything.  This spectacular 'Unprecedented' rally has not went up any more than historic bull traps.  The spiral of reduced wages &gt; reduced spending &gt; reduced business profits &gt; reduced wages (Loop) is still spinning. '[BRR BRR big big](https://imgur.com/a/S1T7IQQ)' is not improving real  GDP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople think the market is not making sense, or not doing what it'd do if it was going to crash. This is not true. It's only not doing what you think it should do based upon what the news is telling you.  Once we'd seen the drop  of March what was to be expected was a bounce from the low and a [strong rally up to about 25,000  on the Dow peppered with positive news events.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/)  All  of us who know how to trade have been waiting for that.\n\nThe market crash is going to be brutal. The second leg of the move will be bigger than the first one.  The low of the next drop can be under 50% from the high, and all the reasons people say that can't happen they said for the 2019 low breaking in  January, 2020.   A time when a 0.5% drop was considered buying the dip.\n\nWhat has taken weeks to go up will take hours to come down.  [A headline will come from no-where](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gatjxp/whatever_it_is_will_be_on_the_news/) and everything you think you know one day means nothing tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've done a lot of work on this trade.  How a trend fails and reverses is something I know a lot about. Whatever you do as an occupation and hobby - I know as much about this as you do about that. This is both my job and passion.  [I'm betting a lot of money on it,](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gbq6eu/big_short_end_of_day_3/) and I got my money by being really good at betting money in markets.\n\nI think the market is setting up to wipe people out.  Your warning sign of this is going to be the arrival of bad news in the coming week and a fall down to break the low of March. Around this time the news may seem to get better - but this will be your final chance to get out at a cheap loss (and yes, I consider a March low exit cheap relative to what June can bring).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying my forecasts are perfect. They are not, but they really have been good enough to do sensationally well during 2020. I've been short from feb. Long during early April and built up a short in the 24,000 - 25,000 Dow range.   I'll paste below a walk through of analysis and trades to this point. If you care to, you can check the accuracy of it and decide how useful my perspective is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\nFind a three year forecast of the [Dow Jones bear market of the 2020's here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/three-year-forecast-of-dow-jones-crash/)\n\n\\---\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe US indices have been [forming a bubble](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/02/29/formingbubbles/) over the last 50 years. In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&amp;P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.\n\nHere is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).\n\nThe pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)\n\nIn the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/). Individual stocks shorts done poorly, One exception was the Vanguard dividends index VYM. This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)\n\nIndividual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)\n\nLater in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).\n\nIndividual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time. A top in the Dow Jones somewhere in the 24,000 - 25,000",

However i can't seem to wrap my head around the following.  \nThere is this known statement/fact that 95% of mutual fund managers can't beat the market over a 15 year time span (something like that, don't pin me down on the numbers). So it seems to me that stock picking is a loosing philosophy over index funds. On the other hand there is the whole world of value investing, which seems very interesting to me. Now what i don't understand is this: value investing is stock picking, so why would I beat the market with value investing if 95% of professionals can't beat the market consistently? Why does value investing make sense?",

I only seen 1 person with a mask on. It's like we beat Covid. This is the first time I have seen this area with any signs of life since mid March.\n\nI don't care about the $SPY right now, you can keep 5 companies fluffed and it'll maintain a decent value, but volatility will pick up within 30 days imho - 2 weeks for these retards to mingle and 2 weeks for Covid counts to start rising again in these under educated anti-science cities.\n\nI've seen a lot of people mention \"Oh the big panic is done, it'll take WW3 to have a drop like that again\". Well, what happens when these normies realize that Covid doesn't care about their boredom or opinion and that returning to \"normal\" does indeed increase the number of cases and ultimately their chance of exposure/death? You have a large portion of the nation now mentally prepared to reopen and if this reopening goes off the rails everything goes out the window. Truthfully, I wish this particular group the worst, but that's a different conversation as I feel like their haste and recklessness is directly jeopardizing not only mine, but our entire country's future well-being.\n\nROLL WEEKLY VIX PLAYS TO THE UPSIDE BECAUSE MAY 1ST WAS THE START OF THE TIMER ON THIS BOMB and begin longer plays to the downside once we see VIX rip up.\n\nAlso, short anything based in South Florida as these swamp folk don't know the first thing about hygiene or basic health. Plus the number of people I know or friends know that have lost their jobs here is staggering so FL housing is bigly fucked. Even people looking for roommates are willing to let someone move in for as little as $300 a month compared to the normal $700-$1,000 you'd normally see asked for around here.\n\nAlso also, inverse me because I am clearly retarded.

        "selftext": "Since RTX is currently a hot topic, here's a breakdown on what the company represents. Make sure you know and understand what you are investing in.\n\n**Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX)**\n\nRTX was formed from the merger of United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Company.\n\nThe company has four subsidiaries:\n- Pratt &amp; Whitney - aircraft engines and gas turbines\n- Collins Aerospace - aerospace parts and systems for commercial, regional, corporate and military aircraft; also a major supplier for international space programs;\n- Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space - satellite sensors, satellite signal processing, radar, infrared sensors, etc\n- Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense - precision weapons, radars, command and control systems\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney and Collins Aerospace are the merged portions from UTC. \n\nUTC spun off Otis Elevator and Carrier Corporation prior to the merger. \n\nThis makes all of RTX's revenue based on aerospace (both civilian/commercial and military) and defense. The intended goal of the merger was to make a more focused business (hence the spin-offs).\n\n**RTX Revenue Stream Breakdown**\n- Pratt &amp; Whitney - $20.9 billion net sales; 75% Commercial, 25% Military [P&amp;W Fact Sheet Available Here](https://newsroom.prattwhitney.com/collateral)\n- Collins Aerospace - $26 billion net sales; 75% Commercial, 25% Military [Collins Aerospace Fact Sheet](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/-/media/project/collinsaerospace/collinsaerospace-website/newsroom/files/collins_aerospace_fact-sheet.pdf)  \n- Raytheon - $27.1 billion net sales (RTN did not file a 2019 annual report) [2018 Annual Report](https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/4ef5db84-7cfc-41d0-9081-d22a83542afb)\n\nCollectively:\n\nUTC accounted for $35.2 billion in commercial sales and $11.7 billion in military sales\n\nRaytheon accounted for $27.1 billion in sales\n\n$74 billion altogether, with about 48% being commercial sales \n\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAlmost half of RTX's sales are related to commercial aircraft. Commercial air travel is obviously almost non-existent right now. Sales for new aircraft (and engines) will be down dramatically for an unknown but extended period of time, and aftermarket repair and maintanence will also be down. A quote on the company's trajectory/recovery from their CEO during today's conference call:\n\n    \u201cIt\u2019s not a sharp V,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is more like a U shape. I think it\u2019s going to be a full two years before we see a recovery close to what we saw in terms of 2019 levels of aftermarket. That could well be three years.\u201d\n\nTherefore, it looks like the majority of the company's income for the near future will be based on defense contracts. This might explain the recent downtrend in the stock's performance. I personally believe the company is undervalued and is a great long term buy and hold, but it may take several years for the stock to recover. Unlike most of the large defense companies out there, RTX's role in the commercial market gives them a wider range of opportunities than their competitors. Pratt &amp; Whitney's engines are widely regarded as the best on the market, and their placement on new Airbus planes means that they will have long term servicing revenue. Therefore, although they may be the weaker portion of the company in the short term, they should be able to rebound effectively.",

        "selftext": "Ever look at the Tesla ticker thinking \"I wish i got involved when this was $20 a share\", or any other massive cooperation? Yeah well unfortunately its always too late, nobody was there to tell you about how good this company would become and supply you with good DD. Well today is your lucky day retards, im here with some crispy piping hot DD that is going to make you so much trendies you wont even have enough dipping sauce for all them. \n\nLow and behold; vectoIQ. TKR $VTIQ. This is the baby that will change your bum life.\n\n\" There's no big news moving the shares of VectoIQ, which at the moment is just a holding company led by former **General Motors** vice chairman Stephen Girsky. Instead, investors seem to be getting excited about the company's [pending merger with Nikola](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/03/electric-truck-maker-nikola-motors-to-go-public-fo.aspx) after Nikola confirmed earlier this week that the merger is on track to close in the first two weeks of June. \"\n\nNow if you dont know Nikola, they are a massive statup with huge potential in the field of EV's, especially commercial vehicles. The have a PREORDER sales at 10 billion right now, so when they roll out these first models their stock will be going through the roof with all this guaranteed revenue. \n\nThe merger of these company's is expected to happen around June 2nd, which again will have an absolutely massive pump on this stock. \n\nI planned to write more in this DD but to be honest just google it yourself and you will see many more in-depth articles of why this company will basically be the direct competitor to tesla. This company will be massive and their share price is expected to reach around $200 by the end of the year, and how much is it trading for right now? $20. Oh, and go look at the ticker and see how this stock has been doing this month as people realize how big this company will be,  UP 85% THIS MONTH, UP 50% THIS WEEK &amp; UP 25% TODAY.\n\nThis is it boys, you jump in now or forever regret it.

        "selftext": "Hi autists. If you're like me, you got railed in the ass by betting on tankers last week. It was baffling, as they crushed earning and locked in beautiful rates for the next 2 quarters but seemed to continue slipping. \n\nBut it seems like the perfect storm is brewing RIGHT NOW for our babies to TANK through next week for huge gainz.\n\nTankers seem to move inverse to oil, and with LA extending it's lockdown to AUGUST (surely many other cities will follow) and renewing tensions with China, oil looks primed for a drawback.\n \nAdditionally, we're approaching that time of month where oil futures holders start to panic and look to sell off their oil (tankers have consistently begun uptrends around the middle of each month).\n\nIf all that isn't enough, most of these guys are trading at ridiculous discounts, near all time lows regardless of the literal all time greatest market they are enjoying right now. \n\nMy personal favorite, STNG, is trading at 50% of it's NAV. Also, the pretty lines on my screen made a nice pattern that says large green dildos incoming (triple bottom and subsequent breakout AH).\n\nTendie time?",

        "selftext": "Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 5/9-5/11. I\u2019m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem \"important\" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot much good stuff for this weekend. Just watching the DD from Friday seeing how it pans out. We will get right into a couple plays but this one doesn't have many plays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OKTA;**  Okay, Okta is another cloud company. Straight from Wikipedia it;\n\n&gt;...provides cloud software that helps companies manage and secure user authentication into modern applications, and for developers to build identity controls into applications, website web services and devices.\n\nThis means that they can make lots of money when everyone is working at home and overhauling their network because of the increased web traffic. This equates into more growth for an already growing company. I'm just gonna copy and paste the important shit [from this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gez830/why_okta_is_a_solid_play/) which gives you everything you need to make a decision.\n\n&gt;Financial performance has been truly outstanding in recent years, with revenue growth reaching 54% annually since 2017. Management comments during the company's investor day on April 1 confirmed that the business keeps firing on all cylinders based on recent data, and several research firms increased their price targets for Okta after the conference.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Most high-growth companies in the sector are losing money due to aggressive reinvestment needs to support long-term growth. Okta, on the other hand, is already generating positive free cash flows, and management has ambitious targets over the middle term.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Okta intends to deliver revenue growth rates in the range of 30% to 35% over the next five years and a free cash flow margin of 20-25% in fiscal 2024. These targets are not easy to achieve, but they are not unrealistic either when considering the company's track record and future opportunities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Total revenue last quarter reached $167.3 million, an increase of 45% year over year. Subscription revenue was $158.5 million, an increase of 46%. Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) reached $1.21 billion, growing by 66% year over year.\n\nEarnings come out 5/28 and should be a beat. I don't plan on entering this myself but I will absolutely look into it again next week and make a firm decision by then. I will update in one of my posts that week what I will do with Okta.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CDLX;**  Cardlytics is a company that provides a marketing channel inside apps like Wells Fargo &amp; Bank of America, through consumer cash-back deals. For the retards, they put ads in banking apps with discounts so that people are likely to buy them. As we know, people are spending a shit ton of money online. Amazon, Shopify, Etsy, etc. are all making money hand over fist because of our consumer culture. People are spending money and this is good for any company that advertises deals. Here is what is interesting and the reason I might buy into this, according to the [OP of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg0jz7/cardlytics_nyse_cdlx_preearnings_call_next_monday/), before covid most of the ads in these banking apps were for airlines, cruises, theme parks; attractions. Now, most of these ads are for clothing deals, carryout, amazon, movies. This means they have successfully flipped their market to generate maximum profit from consumer trends in the wake of a quarantine. If this is true then it is brilliant. Another indicator of performance is the fact that Cardlytics insiders have been buying into their company to the point of spending around $33 million to buy shares of their own company.\n\nIf I had the liquidity to buy in, I would. Earnings release after hours today and I can see them reaching above $50 easily. I'm tied up right now but if I would have seen this earlier I would be in. Do your own research though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guidance;**  If you have SmileDirectClub (SDC) calls then I would sell today, this is if you bought them because of my post on Friday. This run-up is indicative of a massive sell off after earnings no matter if they are good or not. If you got the $8.5 then you are a wealthy man. Don't be greedy. Wish I would have bought it on Friday last week. \n\nedit; My bad I thought earnings came out after hours today. Disregard this I would still hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My moves;**  Because of popular demand and as a credibility enhancer, I have decided to include my moves in regards to the stocks that I write about. This will include things from past DD summaries and ongoing trades. Most of them will not be this long and will only include my moves not an explanation but because this is the first I will include that stuff and more.\n\nToday (5/11) I bought CSCO $45.5c 5/15 and LOGI $60c 5/15 because both are down today and report earning very soon. Both were in my last DD summary so read that for more information on why. I plan to use the earnings from both of those plays to get in on BOX and carry over into next week. I also have some SATS calls that I am still trying to offload. I made quite a bit on SATS $35c so I used a small percentage of my profits to buy back in at $40 and lost that money but I\u2019m not hurt over that.\n\nI have a project going on with another user which will help find the perfect options contract to make a reasonable amount of money based on the smallest moves in underlying price. It is in its testing phases right now but we plan to use it next week for ourselves to see how well it works then I will look into releasing some of that information to you guys. That's all I can really say about it but know that it's taking up a bit of my time because of research and implementation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Okta could make big bucks I will update on that one, Cardlytics will get above $50, Sell SmileDirectClub calls today.\n\n**Plays;** OKTA calls for 6/5 (but dont buy yet), CDLX calls above $50 for 5/15 and buy today because they report after hours.\n\n**Previous WSB DD Summaries;**[ 4/28-5/1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gby6ez/dd_from_42851_match_alphabet_and_a_reminder_tldr/), [5/2-5/4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdkvqf/dd_from_5254_zillow_next_leg_down_oil_reminder/),[ 5/5-5/8](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfxy98/dd_from_5558_cisco_logitech_box_and_smiledirect/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.",

        "selftext": "Capital One is getting squeezed. On top of the coronavirus depression, the oil futures they hold for clients caused them losses so great that they might need to register with CFTC. This is a relatively small part of their balance sheet though: the lion's share of their business is lending to Americans who can barely pay them the minimum payment each month while they extend them more credit. Sounds like an impending disaster.\n\nI have an auto loan with them and they sent me a letter saying that automatic payments must be cancelled more than three business days in advance, despite what I was \"inadvertently\" informed when I signed up for automatic payments on the app. That sounds desperate.\n\nOn the sub r/Capital One, the last few posts are from folks who are not immediately getting credit for credit card payments. I can confirm as a Capital One customer that ordinarily I receive credit immediately upon payment. This, again, sounds desperate.\n\nThe last time I posted about Capital One on this sub, several Capital One shills commented about how great the company is to work for, how allegations of their predatory lending practices are overblown etc. (\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g86bjt/capital_one_cof_is_probably_in_much_worse_shape/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\nNow, curiously, the sub r/CapitalOne is locked. I attempted to post to it from a couple usernames and was informed that \"you aren't allowed to post here.\" There hasn't been a post there for 11 days - and the last ones visible are all negative.\n\nI think Capital One is going to great lengths to shore up its balance sheet by pulling out all the stops their customers agreed to in the fine print and may be involved in locking down the sub r/CapitalOne. \n\nCapital One is a lender that will be hit hard by the coronavirus depression.

The CME recently raised its margin requirements for forward oil contracts. The June contract now requires margin of $10,000.  Given that each contract is 1,000 barrels of oil, simple math tells us that $10 per barrel is a key level to watch in trading.  Should crude fall under the $10 mark, it could trigger margin calls. That could in turn force more selling to raise cash, which sends prices lower, and the vicious cycle continues.\n\n5.) Settlement for June Oil futures contacts is on May 19th. We all remember what happened the day leading up to this last month when oil went negative.\n\n6.) All of this will lead right into NAT earnings on May 18th... \n\n7.) You will hear a loud BOOM! That will be the sound of the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b blowing up there accounts.",

I do this so you can make the best possible well informed decision before you decide to make a purchase. \n\nAs I've mentioned to most of you, I'm well into the cancer companies/industry because of my father's illness. This \"Liquid Biopsy\" is seriously amazing and as soon as it catches on it will tap into a market that other companies aren't in.\n\nLike I mentioned in this post, with traditional biopsies, it is invasive &amp; depending on the location of the tumor, some patients can't even get a biopsy. Plus with a traditional biopsy, you run the risk of aggravating the cancer &amp; accelerating it's growth. With the liquid biopsy, it changes all that and it allows for the oncologist to plan the best form of treatment since they'll have all the knowledge possible of the cancer prior to making the treatment plan.\n\nAnyways, hope this DD can provide you the best knowledge possible so you can make a well informed decision before deciding to purchase stocks. I have tomorrow and Sunday off of work, so I will be posting more DDs on companies I feel will have positive growth this year.\n\nTake care Everyone &amp; have a good weekend!! :)",

        "selftext": "A lot of people act like the market has left everyone behind but there are still great companies on extreme discounts in a variety of sectors, including tech. Here are some stocks from my watchlist that are still well below highs:\n\n**Brookfield Asset Management - BAM** (26.17% down from 52w high) - a diversified asset manager company involved in real estate, renewable power, infrastructure and private equity assets. As safe a real estate play as you can make because of the wide moat. COVID-19 was the first snag they hit since 2008.\n\n**Workday - WDAY** (26.56% down from 52w high) -  provides enterprise cloud applications to  help its customers to manage critical business functions and optimize their financial and human capital resources. Beat Q1 earnings by a big margin and are still down.\n\n**Bruker Corp - BRKR** (28.32% down from 52w high) - makes scientific instruments and analytical/diagnostic instruments for a wide array of fields. Missed earnings this quarter, but this was a stock that grew 1200% from 2008 til pre-COVID.\n\n**Disney - DIS** (29.75% down from 52w high) - yes their parks are in limbo and many of their stores worldwide are shut down and their movies are suspended. But Disney has the resources to weather this storm, and Disney+ has been a lifesaver. If looking long-term, this price may never be seen again once they announce reopenings.\n\n**Exact Sciences Corp - EXAS** (32.29% down from 52w high) - Makes cancer screening tests. COVID-19 has temporarily slowed cancer screenings, but this could bounce back and has grown immensely the past 5 years. Additionally they acquired Genomic Health last year, which focused on genomic based genetic research for cancer detection.\n\n**Hewlett Packard - HPQ** (35.6% down from 52w high) - Strikes me as one of the most underrated large caps right now. They make great products, and it's highly likely an increase in remote work led to increased sales of laptops and printers. \n\n**JP Morgan - JPM** (36.26% down from 52w high) - The best run of the investment banks imo, as they are highly diversified. For a company hammered this hard, they are bound to come out of this even better positioned for the future. \n\n**Conoco Phillips - COP** (37% down from 52w high) - Has already shot way up the past month (I regret selling more than half my shares), but still far below it's highs so plenty more room to rebound. They struck me as one of the better positioned oil companies to make it through this and bounce back given their rock solid financials.\n\n**Raytheon - RTX** (38.64% down from 52w high) - whoever is President, it's hard to bet against the military-industrial complex. Pre-COVID, up 400% from the 2008 trough. Commercial and business aviation connections have definitely hurt them in the short term, but their military applications give them a broader moat, and they seem to be much better run than Boeing, for example.\n\n**StoneCo - STNE** (41.89% down from 52w high) - basically the Square of Brazil, from what I understand, and traded on Nasdaq. Develops fintech solutions for electronic commerce across in-store, online, and mobile channels for small and medium sized businesses. Unlike Square, it is apparently still accurately valued in a time of concern for small and medium size businesses. The added long-term benefit of being in a developing economy also seems to be a good selling point.\n\n**Pinterest - PINS** (49.42% down from 52w high) - has been considered a loser financially for a while, but it seems with the arrangement with SHOP  they are finally figuring out how to better monetize their platform -- which has an extremely loyal following among women especially. The potential for future growth for a stock that has surpassed Snapchat as the #3 social media site in domestic users (47% of internet users in the US, 2/3rds of those female) is enormous. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on these and their future potential for growth? How soon do you think they bounce back to ATHs?",

        "selftext": "There has been a lot of pontification recently on the Fed, QE, inflation etc. While most of these posts have good intentions, they clearly have no clue what the fuck is actually going on. This is like when an eight year old tries to explain the world to a five year old and the five year old is so impressed. It's so bad that I had to waste another hour of my day to write this way too long post to save you guys from yourselves. My last guide to the oil markets was meant to save you idiots from buying USO, but I was too late. This time I hope to reach you in time. This is a complex topic that entire books have been written about. I've skimmed over and oversimplified a lot, but it's still long so buckle up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start from basics. First, you have to understand the difference between the Fed and the Treasury. The Treasury is the department of the government that takes in revenue (taxes) and borrows money (issuing Treasury bills/notes/bonds). For our purposes, we mostly care about the borrowing side of things. The Treasury holds almost daily auctions to issue new debt. This debt is then used to fund Congress approved government spending. Essentially investors hand over money to the Treasury in return for bonds. The mechanics of Treasury auctions are actually very interesting, but outside the scope of this post. If there's interest, upvote a comment indicating such and I will post a follow up that details how this works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Federal Reserve is the central bank of the US. It's has a dual mandate of max employment and price stability (2% inflation). The Fed controls the amount of liquidity in the system primarily through changes in the money supply. Things can get very technical here, but at a basic level, if the fed wants to \"help\" the economy, it lowers the cost of borrowing by creating new money and buying securities (not stocks) from banks and increasing their reserves. Now that these banks have more cash, they're more willing to lend to other banks at lower rates, which lowers the Fed Funds Rate. All other rates should in theory follow. If the Fed thinks everything is amazing or even too good and is worried about inflation, then it will do the opposite by selling securities that it owns and taking back the money. The securities mentioned here are not stocks, but Treasuries, and foreign sovereign debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that that's clear, let's discuss monetary vs fiscal policy. Monetary policy is the realm of the Fed. They actually have a somewhat limited scope to what they can do. For the most part, they can buy/sell US and foreign soverign debt instruments to target interest rates. Recently, they've decided they can also buy bond and bond ETFs to keep corporate bond rates low. They are not allowed to buy stocks. In order to do so would require Congress to amend some laws. Fiscal policy is what Congress can do, which is pretty much anything if they can ever agree on it. Fiscal policy is financed by the Treasury department issuing more bonds. The Fed can do whatever it likes within the pre-set rules without approval from Congress. That's why monetary policy can move so quickly. However, it has those tight limits which is why Jay Powell is always telling Congress they need to do more on the fiscal side. Monetary policy = fast and unlimited in depth, but limited in breadth. Fiscal policy = slow, but unlimited in depth and breadth if Congress ever agrees. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow what the heck is QE (Quantitative Easing)? Well when the Fed wants to lower interest rates in the manner I described above, they start running into trouble when they hit the Effective Lower Bound (ELB). Here in the US we've determined that's zero. In Europe, it's somewhere around -50bps (100 bps = 100 basis points = 1%). The reason why there is an ELB is because it destroys banks. Imagine if rates were -10% (borrowers get paid 10% interest)? Banks would all be bankrupt unless they could pass this negative rate onto depositors. Smart depositors would skirt any attempt from banks by just keep physical cash under the mattress (interest rate of 0). Imagine being able to borrow at -10% and just waiting and earning 0%? For those of you are slow, that's the same as earning 10% return on your cash today. Some nobel prize winning economists have advocated getting rid of cash or making any future cash deposit worth 90 cents on the dollar to allow for deeply negative rates in the future (so keep an eye out for the war on cash). Tangent aside, once you hit the ELB, the Fed has to take different actions to put more money into the system. What they end up doing is a reverse auction where they go out into the open market and buy Treasuries and Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) from investors (notice it's not just banks here). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, now you have the basics, let's answer some questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Congress is doing all these bailouts how are we going to pay for it all?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCongress is doing a ton of bailouts (fiscal policy), and the Treasury will issue a ton of new debt to pay for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Ok, but doesn't that mean interest rates are going to skyrocket?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a vaccum this would be true. If someone is selling a ton of crap, then buyers would want to pay a lower price (charge a higher interest rate). In bond world, prices and interst rates are inverse (If interest rates go up, prices of bonds go down). However, the Fed through QE will be monetizing that debt by buying bonds through a reverse auction. Essentially, investors are just middle men, buying from the Treasury and selling to the Fed for a slight gain. So, imagine a world where someone is trying to sell you a penny for 10 dollars. You would never do that right? Well you would if you knew there was someone else you could turn around to and sell the same penny for 11 dollars to. This is essentially what's happening here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Why doesn't the Fed just buy from the Treasury?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood question, there's some laws in place that prevent that. The Fed has to buy in the secondary market (from investors) instead of the primary market (from the Fed). This is not true in some countries like the UK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"So does that mean we can just issue as much debt as possible?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot quite. The more debt we issue, the more the Fed has to buy so that investors will be willing to pay high prices (low rates) for that debt. To do so the Fed has to print more money. The way this might eventually unravel is that the Fed will print sooooo much money that investors lose faith in the dollar. When this happens (hyper)inflation will take hold. If it gets severe enough, the Fed will be forced to raise rates, this will cause new Treasury debt to be issued at higher rates and eventually we default. This scenario is commonly referred to as the Fed losing control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Why hasn't this happened?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis hasn't happened because we are the reserve currency of the world, we've never defaulted, and we have the strongest military.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I heard the Treasury curve inverted recently. Doesn't that mean the Fed has lost control?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo. Treasury curves \"invert\" when long term rates fall below short term rates. Intuitively, if you're going to lend someone money for 10 years you would want a higher return than for 2 years. That makes sense. When the yield curve inverts, the government is able to borrow for 10 years at a cheaper rate than for 2 years which at first glance doens't make sense. This generally happens as a part of what's called a  \"bull flattening\". Bull as in bond prices are rising (interest rates are falling). Flattening as in the shape of the curve is get getting flat (Plot time to maturity on the x axis, and the yield (for simplicity think of this as the same as the interest rate) on the y-axis. If they are the same yield, then you have a flat line. If 10 yr yields are higher than 2 yr yields you have an updward sloping \\[steep\\] line). This is generally a sign of economic weakness because investors are selling risk assets (stocks) and buying bonds and thus lowering interest rates. In a normal market, all bonds should rise and all yeilds would go down. However, since the Fed targets the front end, short rates have less flexibility to move. It's actually because the Fed is in control that the yield curve inverts. When this happens, it's generally a signal to the Fed that they should lower interest rates so that front end rates can also move down allowing the curve to steepen. If the Fed agrees with the market that things are weak they do this. If they don't, they wait and when investor confidence returns, investors sell long dated bonds and go back to buying stocks and the curve naturally steepens out again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"We already have so much debt, how can we afford to service this debt?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe debt that most of you are most familiar with are mortgages. With a mortgage, the principal is amortized over the life of the loan. With each payment some principal amount is paid off. In the government and to a lesser extent the corporate bond world, you only pay interst until the debt is due. At that point the entire principal amount is due. Even though we are issuing more debt, we are probably saving money since older debt with higher interest rates are expiring and being replaced with low interest debt. In Germany where interest rates are negative, the German government literally gets paid interest on new debt. The trouble comes at the end when the principal balance comes due. At this point, the government needs to be able to roll that debt by taking out a new loan (ideally at ever lower or more negative interest rates). So far they have had no problems thanks to the Fed/ECB/BoJ/etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"But but but... my daddy told me I'm smart and my smart brain says bonds will crash because they are selling more. You're a liar!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou want evidence? Check out what happened when QE was launched 2008-2011. Google \"bond vigilantes\". Japan has been doing all this crazy crap for decades. In the JGB (Japanese Government Bond) market, the \"bonds will crash\" trade has been known as the widowmaker since before many of you idiots were out of diapers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[5 years in the future\\] \"hah interest rates are 40bps higher than when you wrote this post! I was right!\"\n\nNo. Interest rates are most likely rising because crisis is over and the Fed is cool with interest rates going up now. This is one outcome, other outcomes include interest rates never rise (look at Europe/Japan) or we have hyper inflation. No one knows if we will have deflation or inflation in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, here are some upvoted posts with incorrect information. I'm not calling these people out just to call them out, but rather to warn you that if you read their post and plan on making a trade based off it then here is what's wrong with what they said. I hope this helps some of those who got their faces ripped off (official trading terminology) by USO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbzxft/the\\_bond\\_market\\_crash\\_begins\\_on\\_may\\_12th\\_and\\_13th/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbzxft/the_bond_market_crash_begins_on_may_12th_and_13th/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"A rising supply of debt increases interest rates... Where does this money come from? Either we borrow it or we print it. If we borrow it, interest rates will will need to rise to attract more creditors. If we print it, interest rates will need to rise to compensate for inflation. Either way, the price of previous bond issues is coming down... buy puts on bond ETFs a few days before the next auction (5/12 or 5/13)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile the Fed is buying and people have faith in the dollar, interst rates will not rise much, and bonds will crash. There might be brief blips of a few basis points, but that's because the Fed allows it. If there is anything more than a wobble here, the Fed will institute Yield Curve Control (YCC). Currently the Fed only targets near term interest rates and allows more flexibility in longer term rates. With YCC, they will explicitly target many different maturities and keep the curve in the exact shape they like. They will do this buy buying and selling Treasuries at each maturity. They can print as many dollars as required to do this until people lose faith in the dollar. People will not lose faith in the dollar this month. Maybe in 10 or 20 years, but short dated puts are definitely going to fail. Any trade on short term time frames would be betting that the Fed wants interest rates at that maturity to rise. This seems counter to their stated goals at present. \n\n \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gesown/tea\\_leaves\\_qe\\_and\\_intl\\_demand\\_for\\_the\\_dollar\\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gesown/tea_leaves_qe_and_intl_demand_for_the_dollar_why/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"QE works by selling our debt (bonds) to other countries (or large institutions) to generate liquidity, and using said liquidity (formerly for buying various Gov bonds, and since QE began, by buying bonds and other longer term securities from the private sectors)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is almost the opposite of QE. QE is the Fed printing money and buying securities. This does generate liquidity, but I think the author doesn't know what liquidity is. Liquidity is essentially how easy it is to transact. Let's say you buy a new house and decide to sell it the next day. Chances are it will take a long time and the price you sold will be much lower than the price you bought. This is illiquid. Let's say you bought Apple stock and decided you want to sell it the next second. Chances are you can do it immediately and at pretty much the same price. Very liquid. Now imagine you're an investor who has bought a Mortgage Backed Security (MBS) and now the economy sucks and people are defaulting on their mortages. You want to sell it, but it's super illiquid now. Even though it's worth $100, no one is willing to buy it for more than $50 because they're scared too. What the Fed is doing is stepping in and buying it from you at near fair value instead of 50% lower. This then gives you capital to buy newly created MBS. It also gives other market participants confindence to increase their bids as well. If the Fed doesn't step in, you can't sell your old shitty MBS so you can't buy the new MBS. The new MBS gets stuck with the bank/originator who doesn't want it and now they can't give out any more mortgages and the whole housing market collapses. This is why the Fed is providing liquidity in all these different markets. Selling bonds to other countries would just give the Fed more dollars. They would have to do something with those dollars to increase liquidity (like buying MBS). Since the Fed can print dollars at will, they would not need the first step of selling. The Fed for the most part only sells securities to decrease liquidity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR until people lose faith in the dollar, do not expect interest rates to increase in the US (maybe ever). Also, don't trust idiots on WSB to understand and correctly explain to you complicated financial and economic concepts. If it's anything beyond \"buy puts!!!!\" then the most likely outcome is that you will have made each other dumber.",

        "selftext": "The way I have found to get around the PTD is to open a cash account on webull. There are some drawbacks to using a cash account Vs a margin account. If you are use to RH and it\u2019s instant deposit and instant settlement that does not happen with a cash account on webull. The deposit takes about 5 days to clear and become settled funds. But after that it shows up as settled funds and you are free to trade those funds until there are all unsettled. In my experience the funds settle by open the next day.\n\nThe way I use spy to make profit is I look for out of the money options about an hour after market opens. Once I detect a trend in a direction I will by an option in that direction about $2-3 out of the money. These cost about 1.30 if it\u2019s the day before expiration or around .90 if it\u2019s the day of. I don\u2019t hold this to long when the momentum slows down I sell the contract. I\u2019m working with around a $1300 account now i started with $125 about a month ago and have just traded out of the money options that I hold for about an hour at a time at most.once I\u2019m 25% in profit I will let it go a little longer but I\u2019m looking to sell at that point. If the price moves against me more than 10% I sell and cut my loses. I can take 9 or 10 trades a day now before I run out of settled funds. The next morning all my funds are settled and I can trade contracts again picking up 1 or 2 at a time. Given that the spy moves around 5$ a day up or down if you detect the trend early you can make some pretty good gains. Just don\u2019t ride out losing trades and be quick to take profit. \nI hope this helps some of you trading with small accounts. \nLet me know what you think about this strategy and this work around for PTD rule",

        "selftext": "Clearly this rally still has steam, and there aren't any apparent catalysts on the horizon for a return to the downtrend. Everything that the bears have clung to and hoped for has amounted to a wet fart, leaving them with shitstains in their undies, and worthless puts in their portfolios.  \n\n\n* The market doesn't react to unemployment, as it can be explained away as a temporary COVID related blip. \n* Earnings season was a shitshow, but Mr. Market didn't care, as all of the carnage was - say it with me - **priced in**. \n* The retail mania that was brewing in Jan-Feb has returned, and people have reloaded their powder bags with Trump Buxx. \n\nBeing bearish this month is a very bad idea... but eventually the market will have to pay the piper. Fortunately this summer, there will likely be a great opportunity to reenter puts. Although optimal timing may be mid-July, a mid-June entry makes it less likely to miss the put train to Tendie-Town. \n\nOver the upcoming 6 weeks, the vast majority of the US will attempt a \"return to normal\" in daily life and (at least according to the bull thesis), spending habits. It's doubtful that consumer behavior will return to what it was pre-COVID, however. These changes in consumption will be reflected in the July earnings season, and then once again the BEA's initial Q2 GDP estimate (released on [July 30](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule)). Although Q1 numbers have been explained away as COVID (despite most of Q1 not being impacted by the lockdown), market psyche after things have \"returned to normal\" may not be as tolerant of blood-red Q2 earnings and guidance. These awful numbers (from a quarter which was FAR more heavily impacted by lockdown) may not be \"priced in\". \n\nPresently, it seems as though most Americans and investors have the impression that job losses are only temporary, and people will be able to simply go back to their previous job after things reopen. The July and August BLS numbers will likely tell another story. Any residual unemployment in these months will be reflective of **sustained** job losses. The August numbers will be particularly telling,  as these will capture the people who haven't returned to work *even after Trump Buxx have run out*. \n\nRight now, options are rather expensive, which makes puts less attractive still. Although the VIX has had a **massive** downtrend in [the past 6 weeks](https://imgur.com/a/mhEd0dP), it's still quite high historically (over double the \"normal\" range of 12-15). This means that a speculator has to pay for a considerable amount of Vega when an option is purchased. As the downtrend in VIX (likely) continues, we may see this Vega cost reduce significantly, which will result in considerably cheaper OTM options over the coming weeks. Given the rate of decay from such elevated numbers, it's quite possible that we see a VIX of 17 within 5 weeks.\n\nThe real dark horse will be if we have to shut the country back down. There is **no way** that this administration will do this unless things have completely gone to hell, similar to what Italy or New York looked like at their worst. It's unlikely we see this level of spread anytime soon, as lockdown measures are still fairly firmly in place. Roughly 4-6 weeks after reopening, though (aka mid-late June), it's possible that things are bad enough that Trump has to double back and close back down.\n\nIn the meantime... **there really isn't much that bears can look forward to to save them**.  Maybe there's some TA bullshit that they can cling to, but from a fundamentals standpoint (or at least how those fundamentals will be spun by the market and interpreted by the retail investor), the cavalry is NOT on the horizon anytime soon. After the middle of next month, though, the bear thesis becomes much stronger, and if one purchases an option that has enough time to truly play out (Nov 2020 puts), the returns may be extreme.  Additionally, if the Summer Bear Party doesn't come to pass, a Nov expiry allows for an early exit, without losing all value in the position. All of the above though would clearly be proven wrong by the end of August, at which time Nov puts would still have a considerable amount of retained Theta value. \n\nTLDR: If we see an ongoing rally in SPY and VIX under 18 before Jun 26, load up on OTM Nov dated puts. I'm anticipating SPY $315. Although I'm cash-gang right now, I expect to sink $100k into 11/20 SPY $305p. \n\nFor now, bears, it's time to abandon ship on your puts.",

        "selftext": "Often I see people either taking analyst recommendations seriously, or saying that Wallstreet analysts are a bunch of idiots. Neither is true. The important thing to understand here is that it\u2019s actually not their job to help retail investors (you) make money. Here\u2019s how Wallstreet actually works:\n\nMost research analysts work for banks. You probably know that these analysts get paid very good salaries. But research in and of itself doesn\u2019t generate revenue. So how is their existence justified? \n\nLet\u2019s first talk about how banks actually make money. Banks generate revenue via corporate activities \u2013 these include both equity and debt financing deals \u2013 when a company sells new stock to investors, Wallstreet takes a clip. They also take a clip when a company issues new debt. It is true that investors pay Wallstreet some commissions to trade stock and to consume research, but those are dwarfed by fees for facilitating debt and equity issuance. Wallstreet also makes big fees when companies buy one another, so called mergers and acquisitions.\n\nSo as a bank, you want to do everything you can to get a company to choose you when they are selling additional securities. How do they do this? Well one good way is to write flattering research about the company. A research analyst at an investment bank is not supposed to make recommendations that help investors make money, the research analyst is supposed to make recommendations that maintain good relations with the company, so that their ECM, DCM and M&amp;A teams can get deals that make the bank money. \n\nIf we take an example \u2013 some people have asked me why do research analysts keep upgrading Tesla\u2019s stock price target as the share price goes up? No, it\u2019s not because they are stupid. No, it\u2019s not because they can\u2019t see that Tesla is more expensive than all the other US automakers combined. Yes, they can see that the stock price went up while Tesla stopped making cars. BUT Tesla is a company that requires a lot of money (maybe even more now due to their production delays)! And that means both equity issuance and debt issuance. The ECM and DCM bankers are sitting there salivating at the fees that they can make as long as Elon picks them as the lead bookrunner. And these are the guys that get paid the big bucks on Wallstreet \u2013 they go and have a word with the manager of the guy that writes about Tesla, a much lesser earner, and make it clear that they need their firm to stand out as the most bullish on the street, so that Elon chooses them for his next raise. Consequently all of Wallstreet falls over each other to keep upgrading in the hopes of getting into the company\u2019s good graces. It\u2019s twisted, but this is just how Wallstreet works. \n\nThis is also why there are no upgrades for boring cheap and profitable companies. They don\u2019t need Wallstreet, so Wallstreet doesn\u2019t talk about them. On the other hand, if you are a money burning software company that pays their employees in stocks? No problem, no profits required \u2013 you will get upgrades. Research analysts are required to tie themselves into knots to justify any stock price, lest their delicious bonus will look an awful lot less delicious. \n\nThe same goes for companies that like to make acquisitions \u2013 cash rich guys with a bit of an empire building streak \u2013 here Wallstreet wants to pander to them to make money on the acquisition streak \u2013 think Allergan before it blew up. Also companies that are in areas where a lot of M&amp;A activity is going on \u2013 guys that may be purchased by said acquirers \u2013 Wallstreet wants to pump these up to make a bigger fee when they get taken out!\n\nOf course, the issue with buying into this is that it can blow up at any moment. Wallstreet can\u2019t manipulate the whole market. Wallstreet also doesn\u2019t care if Tesla goes to $300 and all the \u201csuckers\u201d (as they call them) who bought based on their recommendations lose money. Once Wallstreet can\u2019t make money out of a company, they don\u2019t care about it anymore. They will still be laughing all the way to the bank.  \n\n**TL;DR: Wallstreet analysts are a bunch of self-interested cheerleaders. Don\u2019t expect them to produce any actual research based on facts. Just like you, they want to make money.**",

You might recall we first discussed those 23 days ago here:   \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3gtcq/seeing\\_the\\_forest\\_through\\_the\\_tea\\_leaves\\_a\\_birds/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3gtcq/seeing_the_forest_through_the_tea_leaves_a_birds/)  \n\n\nWhile we weren't, and still aren't, 100% able to quantify WHY they happen, and we likely never will. I am now basically 100% conviced they're fraudulent, at least, during the rally. That probably sounds like sour grapes, which I get, but I don't recall losing much of anything at the bottom, in the switch. \n\nWhat I am committed to, is making plays that are 100% grounded in good observation. We won't win them all, but we should win more than we lose. A lot of other people have noticed that fundamentals are completely unhinged from stock prices right now, and I'd refer you to our original thesis statements:   \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwg1kr/macro\\_micro\\_tea\\_leaves\\_palm\\_reading\\_and\\_other/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwg1kr/macro_micro_tea_leaves_palm_reading_and_other/)\n\n\"On a larger scale, stonks will always only go up.

This doesn't make much sense. If 65-392 million volume happens during the day, how does it get out-done by 500k at night?\n\nRemember that High Frequency trading (Algo-bot) makes up 50%+ of trades, and based on volume alone, we know they aren't operating at night: \n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091615/world-high-frequency-algorithmic-trading.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091615/world-high-frequency-algorithmic-trading.asp)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the crash, large institutions that trade in the overnight got to give you 3.90 dollars of loss for every .83c you were able to participate in. That trading directly made the day-time traders the \"bag holders\" for most of the loss. We see the reverse on the climb. Combine the abolve with the trend that traders hold trades too long, reducing wins and extending losses, and you have a recipe for failure. \n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/013015/worst-mistakes-beginner-traders-make.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/013015/worst-mistakes-beginner-traders-make.asp)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My conclusions on the above:** \n\nLarger institutions or high net worth individuals are using after hours trading to continue to de-leverage themselves for another crash. By Spiking the market, they're capitalizing on the number of new investors, and less influencial firms and funds that trade during the day. By using small amounts of stock to set a new higher price, or a new lower price, they can setup ideal trades from the daytime traders who are either attempting to cut a loss, not realizing its fraudulent, or sell a 'rising stock' to a day timer, who doesn't realize there is nothing propping it up. The reason they do this is to best avoid most of the fall prices, and gain most of the rising, even if they didn't participate in trading during the day, which we know they do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What can we do with this information:** \n\nWell, we obviously need to plan our trades for the inter-day. Given how choppy the volume is right now during the day, its not very easy to intra-day trade anyways. Stocks are extremely unstable and crashing at rates that are difficult to plan for, and the choppiness is breaking stoplosses left and right. \n\nI think the current best play is to sit out, or scalp runs. Our movement, while slightly upwards still, shows that the rate of decline remains significant higher velocity, and frequently wipes out multiple days for trades. **This makes short-term calls exceptionally risky even though stonks are going up.** \n\nOn the 1 hour chart, there is also a statistically large percent (75%) of the last 20 days that suggest that whatever color the opening 2 hour bar is, that is what color the day will remain, and that the closing bars last value will be at a higher or lower value to the first bars first position as appropriate to the  day's trend.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, back to our fundamentals, where are we at today: \n\nThe country is opening back up, beerflu has been defeated: \n\n[https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-coronavirus-trnd/](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-coronavirus-trnd/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCountries that have already re-opened are starting to report new outbreaks:: \n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/asia/china-south-korea-coronavirus-reopening-intl-hnk/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/asia/china-south-korea-coronavirus-reopening-intl-hnk/index.html)\n\nThe timeline for this seems to be approximately 3 weeks from open to outbreak, based on my reading multiple news outlets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven that the current federal response is to stop testing so much, our \"open - to - outbreak\" time may be reported a bit behind:   \n[https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-we-make-ourselves-look-bad-through-coronavirus-testing-n1202191](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-we-make-ourselves-look-bad-through-coronavirus-testing-n1202191)\n\n[https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/03/26/coronavirus-tests-cara-christ-wants-primary-care-providers-stop-covid-19-testing/2923164001/](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/03/26/coronavirus-tests-cara-christ-wants-primary-care-providers-stop-covid-19-testing/2923164001/)\n\n  \nMeat plants such as those run by Tyson continue to see a huge swath of cases: \n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/tyson-4500-covid-19-cases-as-meat-industry-blames-workers-2020-5](https://www.businessinsider.com/tyson-4500-covid-19-cases-as-meat-industry-blames-workers-2020-5)\n\nAnd while Tyson does employ 122,000 workers, its important to have an idea of what 4500/122,000 really means, which is that at an infected plant, they've seen 58% of workers infected. Those that are lucky enough not to work in a plant, such as admin or other, might very well trend closer to regional averages. \n\n[https://www.kansascity.com/news/coronavirus/article242519791.html](https://www.kansascity.com/news/coronavirus/article242519791.html)  \n\n\nWe know that some lockdown protestors are carrying guns to protests now:   \n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/hundreds-protest-michigan-lawmakers-consider-extending-governors-emergency-powers-n1196886](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/hundreds-protest-michigan-lawmakers-consider-extending-governors-emergency-powers-n1196886)  \n[https://www.bing.com/search?q=north%20carolina%20armed%20protestors&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=north%20carolina%20armed%20protestors&amp;sc=0-31&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=7C4355E027B845C6BBA44A2BF3DC619A](https://www.bing.com/search?q=north%20carolina%20armed%20protestors&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=north%20carolina%20armed%20protestors&amp;sc=0-31&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=7C4355E027B845C6BBA44A2BF3DC619A)  \n\n\nAs are some counter-protestors: \n\n [https://nypost.com/2020/05/08/armed-activists-escort-michigan-lawmaker-to-work-after-protests-against-stay-at-home-order/](https://nypost.com/2020/05/08/armed-activists-escort-michigan-lawmaker-to-work-after-protests-against-stay-at-home-order/)   \n\n\nImagine what happens when someone casts the first stone? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, numerically our thesis remains strong. Our up days are slow and  painful, our downs are quick and costly, leaving an up pace that makes for bad short term options. All of my positions right now are 3+ weeks out, and I'll be reducing the ones I keep tomorrow to 45+ days out, because decay is eating too much of them. Individual plays during earnings remain somewhat unhinged, some companies are acting appropriately, and some are Tesla's and bounce around like ping pong balls. I'd be hesitant to wanna put any real amount of money in any high-volume companies, and anything in SPY, as I'd expect them to be most manipulated at night. \n\nWe're still waiting a bit for the 2nd round of oil fuckery, and about 20 days to go before the big mortgage/rent question comes due. A stimulus for UBI variant will delay this again, but I have serious doubts about our ability to pass such a thing. TBD.   \n\n\nTL:DR\n\nStonks are traveling more at night than during the day. Unlikely to be legit. \n\nShort term calls for specific earnings play only. Cut profits before they risk crashing.    \nShort positions still look bad.   \nFundamentals say rally will be unstable based on other countries 2nd wave reports. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck autists.",

India is prioritizing medical equipment suppliers, food processing units, textiles, leather and auto part makers among more than 550 products covered in the discussions, they said.\n\n\nTrump\u2019s move to blame China for its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, which has killed more than a quarter-million people worldwide, is expected to worsen global trade ties as companies and governments move resources out of the world\u2019s second-largest economy to diversify supply chains. Japan has earmarked $2.2 billion to help shift factories from its neighbor, while European Union members plan to cut dependence on Chinese suppliers.\n\nFor Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a surge in investment would help shore up an economy battered by an eight-week nationwide lockdown to control the Covid-19 outbreak, and help him make up ground hitting a target to grow its manufacturing sector to 25% of gross domestic product by 2022 from 15%. The need to create employment is now even more urgent after the pandemic left 122 million people jobless and forced India to shut down all major cities.\n\nRead:India Pledges Easy Access to Land for Factories Leaving China\n\n\nIt could also present India with a chance to finally push through long-stalled reforms on land, labor and taxes that have hindered investment for years. Modi\u2019s second term has been marred by nationwide protests and slow growth since his party scored a landslide election victory a year ago, presenting a risk for companies planning to move.\n\n\u201cThere are opportunities for India to try to gain a place in global supply chains, but this will require serious investments in infrastructure and governance,\u201d said Paul Staniland, an associate professor at the University of Chicago who writes about India\u2019s politics and foreign policy. \u201cIndia faces tough competition from elsewhere in South and Southeast Asia.\u201d\n\nOfficials have told companies that India is more economical in terms of securing land and affordable skilled labor than if they moved back to the U.S. or Japan, even if overall costs are still higher than China. They have also offered an assurance that India will consider specific requests on changes to labor laws, which have proved a major stumbling block for companies, and said the government is considering a request from e-commerce companies to postpone a tax on digital transactions introduced in this year\u2019s budget.\n\nTax, Labor Laws\n\n\nIndia\u2019s trade ministry has sought detailed feedback from U.S. companies on changes needed to make the country\u2019s tax and labor laws more favorable to companies, said one of the officials. Modi\u2019s federal government is working with states to ensure long term solutions, the official added, including developing land banks to ensure a quick start for units.\n\nIndia expects to win over U.S. companies involved in healthcare products and devices, and is in talks with Medtronic Plc and Abbott Laboratories on relocating their units to the country, an official said. Medtronic spokesman Ben Petok and Abbott spokeswoman Darcy Ross didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nBoth Medtronic and Abbott have a presence in India, which may make it easier for them to move their China supply chains to the country, according to an official. They\u2019re based out of financial center Mumbai and already work with large Indian hospital groups.\n\n\nRead: Trump Hails Stronger India Ties With an Eye to Countering China\n\nIndia\u2019s trade ministry spokesman didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment on the effort to lure U.S. companies.\n\nThe push by Modi\u2019s government comes as India tries to regain lost ground after many companies chose countries like Vietnam over India as an alternative destination when Trump started his trade war with China. Modi has tried to shore up U.S. investments and improve ties through corporate tax cuts, two massive public rallies with Trump in Houston and India, and a $3 billion defense deal.\n\n\nSecretary of State Michael Pompeo last month said the U.S. was working with India, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam on how to \u201crestructure these supply chains to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\u201d The administration was \u201cturbocharging\u201d an initiative to remove global supply chains from China, Reuters reported this week, with one official saying it\u2019s pushing for an \u201cEconomic Prosperity Network\u201d of trusted partners.\n\n\u2018Replace China\u2019\n\n\u201cMy read is that the network, if it pans out, will look to India and Vietnam to replace China in the global supply chain network,\u201d said Derek Grossman, researcher at the Washington-based RAND Corporation who held positions in the U.S. Intelligence Community for more than a decade. \u201cThis would be a rough fit in terms of replacing China\u2019s immense manufacturing capabilities, but perhaps the U.S. has high hopes that India and Vietnam can quickly ramp up to at least equal Chinese capacity.\u201d\n\nIndia in April partially lifted a ban on the export of hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol following a request from Trump. It also approved 130 billion rupees ($1.7 billion) worth of investments to make more bulk drugs and medical devices, and to boost local manufacturing of drug intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients to cut dependence on imports from China.\n\n\n\u201cIndia is a bigger market than Vietnam or Cambodia so it should be a bigger draw for investors looking to move operations out of China,\u201d said Ajay Sahai, director general and chief executive officer of the Federation of Indian Exporters. \u201cBut apart from ensuring land, water and sewerage, the most important change India needs to make is to give a clear guarantee that the government will not introduce retrospective tax amendments.\u201d\n\nSome states including Maharashtra have ensured that supply chains for foreign manufacturers remained functional through India\u2019s national virus lockdown. Others like Tamil Nadu in the south and Uttar Pradesh in the north have offered concessions for those planning to move.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s abundant capital in the U.S. that\u2019s looking for geographies outside, and we can see India responding,\u201d said Mukesh Aghi, president of the U.S.-India Strategic and Partnership Forum, a Washington-based group that advocates for policies that further business ties between the countries. \u201cCompanies realize that while large supply chains in China may have been economical, there\u2019s no point in keeping all your eggs in one basket.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Hello idiots, it's your friend Duncan here again for my apparently weekly series on how to use math and logic to ~~own the libs~~ justify your reckless financial decisions. You might remember my previous posts telling you to [buy calls on a company that eats the poor for money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8od1g/cacc_subprime_autoloans_are_totally_gonna_go_tits/), and urging you to [hoard gold like some autistic mountain dragon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcdjeo/dd_gld_stagflation_and_you/). \n\n\n\n\n\nFor today's installment, I wanted to show use a 10K to understand why the market might price things the way they do. A 10K is a free, publicly available document that Michael Burry said every good investor should read. Obviously, there are no good investors in WSB, but I love shouting uselessly into the void, so here we are. \n\n\n\n\n\nA 10K is usually a large document comprised of a bunch of information about a company's risks, financials, direction, and operations. Its a single all encompassing primer on the company and its vision of its future. However, today I am going to focus on one of the most accessible parts: The Balance Sheet. The balance sheet, cash flows, and a few other segments are actually not written by the company, but by an independent auditor who is required to comply with auditing standards called GAAP. This means that while a company can still engage in some fuckery, you can be pretty sure that the balance sheets and cash flow statements are basically true and correct. \n\n\n\n\n\nA balance sheet is essentially a snapshot of everything the business owns, and everything in owes. The sheet always appears in balance as **Assets=Liabilities+Equity**   Let take a look at the balance sheet for two companies you are all familiar with: America's two largest chicken tendie manufacturers: Sanderson Farms ($SAFM) and Tyson Foods ($TSN). Both are major players in the livestock/protein agribusiness sector, so why then do we see SAFM trading at around 146 with an insanely high P/E of 100.62. Tyson, in contrast, is trading at 59 with a P/E of 10. Why the hell does the market think Sanderson has 10x the potential of Tyson? Lets look at their balance sheets to find out. \n\n\n\n\n[Tyson's Balance Sheet is here](https://imgur.com/O9zBuco)\n\n\n\n\n[Sanderson's Balance Sheet is here](https://imgur.com/a/kDI8YvR)\n\n\n\n\nNow, a balance sheet is not a reflection of sales or cash flow, it is a snapshot in time. Lets look at what each major category means:\n\n\n\n\n* Current Assets: This is everything the business owns that is quickly convertible to cash. This is stuff that you could turn into money generally quickly. These are the tendies on your plate(inventories), in your hand (cash), or the ones your mom is walking down the basement stairs with (account receivable)\n\n\n\n\n\n* Net Property Plant, Equipment: This is obviously the plants, processing machines, offices, computers, and other business stuff they company owns. This is like, the oven, the fridge, the plate, the honey mussy, that all go into making your delicious tendies.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Goodwill or intangibles. This is things that aren't really....real. Sometimes it is things that really do have a clear value, like a patent on a way to process chicken, or a specific breed of bird. But sometimes it's, more wishy washy, like 'reputation' or 'brand recognition'. If you compare the balance sheets, Tyson argues that it has a ton of intangibles and goodwill, like tens of billions of dollars in goodwill. Ok buddy. Sure you do. In contrast, Sanderson's balance sheet doesn't really need intangibles and brand recognition to prop it up. It lumps those into a small 'other assets' category.  This is like mommy's love for you. I'm sure mommy loves you, but if you are relying on that to balance out your good boy points and tendies, you might have a structural issue. \n\n\n\n\n* Liabilities. This is an easy one. Current liabilities are the debt that is due this year, and long term debt is everything else. Look at Tyson, if you total it's debts, they are over 50% of assets, and most of that is long term debt. They also have a lot of current liabilities for their cash on hand. If you're an investor, this is a sign that you need to dig deeper. In contrast, Sanderson has few liabilities, and hardly any long term debt. Total liabilities are only about 20% of assets\n\n\n\n\n* Equity. This is the value of shares outstanding. It important to understand Equity is the value of the shares when they were issued times the number of shares issued. It's not the current market cap. You can see, Sanderson hooks shareholders up. Because of the little debt, tons of the company's sweet sweet tendies go straight to shareholder's pockets. No debt servicing here. In contrast, Tyson will need to spend a lot of money to service that debt, leaving less for shareholders.\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you're an investor, which company is better poised to weather the storm of economic uncertainty? Obviously, Sanderson. They can take on debt to finance operations, especially at these historically low interest rates, and once the market stabilizes, they can start buying up the assets of the competitors that have failed. Based on this P/E of 100, the market seems to believe that Sanderson is going to outlast the competition and become the literal Tendie God. \n\n\n\n\nI would love to recommend a play in all this. Common sense says the market has not fully priced in the risks to Sanderson, and Tyson will struggle to weather the market disruptions to poultry prices, demand etc. However, in this opposite bizzaro dimension, we should all do the opposite of common sense. So calls on Tyson and Sanderson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n YOLO",

        "selftext": "So when you ask someone why they are investing in gold they typically say it is an inflation hedge or it is a low risk asset. Now why is it an inflation hedge? Because if the money supply increases ie inflation, people will see this, and go buy gold with the extra money...because it's an inflation hedge? Right? It only works as an inflation hedge if other people think it is an inflation hedge and treat it as such. So if we all agree it is an inflation hedge then it kind of is, but there's nothing fundamental about it that makes it an inflation hedge. You're not getting bullion for your basement, you own 1s and 0s on a server somewhere. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point, it's good in times of crisis. It seems like the same circular logic of gold is good in times of crisis because people will flock to gold because it's stable because...people go to it in times of crisis. But why are you investing it in gold? What is it about an atom with 79 protons that makes it good to hold in a time of crisis? Let's imagine you do receive the delivery (lets talk storage costs as a drag on your return too). Ok so you have gold. A crisis hits. Real bad. The dollar is wiped out! Good thing you have gold. Ok what next? What scenario exists where this gold is now worth having, where does it derive it's worth? Will people just naturally regress to gold as the store of value just because that's what people did in the past? Then forget the scenario where your gold is in 1s and 0s, in the scenario where you need to spend actual gold you're not getting that metal no matter how you think you own it.\n\nAm I missing something here? It basically feels like everyone sees gold as the global back up currency and because they're all in it together (and telling others) this keeps it working that way. There's no central bank or political authority to back this faith either like there is with USD.\n\nThe value of gold should be determined the same way as copper, demand for use in production of goods and services. It is no different than every other commodity except that because it didnt tarnish in the past and it's shiny and pretty, we for some reason treat it different.",

        "selftext": "\n \n \nOil +20% Again\n \nRally Fades by Half\n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a strong start yet again but at the end of the day we had two down waves starting around 2:45 that cut gains by about 2/3.  Market internals were a bit on the soft side with NYSE A/D only 4:3 and NASDAQ 17:15.  Volume was lighter than the past few days and the DJIA had 21 up and 9 down.  The biggest losers were BA -41 and MCD -18 DPs while the gainers were UNH +37, AAPL +30 and HD +26 DPs.  All these names were higher before the last hour with AAPL trading $301 but finishing $297.80.  The news of the day on the economy was not great.  ISM Non-manufacturing Index for Aprildropped to 41.8from 52.5 in March.  50% is the breakpoint for expansion/contraction.  The trade balance showed a widening in the deficit to $44.4 billion from $39.8 in February.  Exports were down $20 billion.  Tomorrow we have the ADP Employment change report for April and weekly MBA Mortgage applications.\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.

NEM was a strong report and the stock, already up from $58 on Friday finished the day $64.91 +2.17 (3.46%), DIS was the big loser with volumes down due to closed parks and no production taking place at the studios.  Streaming is strong, but a big piece is being done at reduced rates or even for free.  At the close the stock was $101.06 -2.12 but after a small rally, the conference call started and after the company disclosed it is suspending its dividend for the first half it slid to 99.25.  BYND reported good sales growth and the recent closures of several major meat processing plants has been buoying prices.  The stock has rallied off an April low of $57 and closed today $100.16 +5.00 and is currently trading $105 + $5 more.\n \nTwo companies in the same business, EA and ATVI went in opposite directions.  EA was a miss and after closing $119.61 +2.78 it fell t0 112.12 and is currently 113.98 \u2013 5.62.  Activision (ATVI) beat handily and it had closed 68.53 +1.83 and is now $72.40 + 3.87 more.  Pinterest (PINS) had risen from a low of $10.10 last month to close $20.81 -.62 but missed on several metrics and has traded down to $16.70 and is $17.15 \u2013 3.66.  Also, on the bad news side, UAL finished $24.12 -1.14 (4.5%) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH) warned about it continuing as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d  The stock is down from $60 and finished the day $11.18 -3.26 (22.58%).\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was HIGHER with TSN +1.57, BGS +.77, FLO +.11, CAG -.03, MDLZ +.19, KHC +.02, CALM -.39, JJSF +2.66, SAFM +1.97, and LANC +7.67 (5.68%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +9.46, ABBV +4.14, REGN +32.55 (6.01%), ISRG +15.01, GILD -1.54, MYL +.05, TEVA +.31, VRTX +7.81, BHC +.10, INCY -2.17, ICPT +1.71, LABU +2.58 and IBB $127.00 +2.45 (1.97%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was LOWER with TLRY -.27, CGC +.10, CRON -.08, GWPH +.72, ACB -.012, PYX -.74, NBEV -.02, CURLF +.06, KERN -.01 and MJ $11.90 -.05 (.42%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +10.14, RTX +.15, GD +1.72, TXT -.34, NOC +6.18, BWXT +3.09 (6.05%), TDY +1.22 and ITA $147.45 +.01.\n \n \nRETAIL was MIXED with M -.06, JWN -.52, KSS -.27, DDS -1.31 (4.8%), JCP -.0145, WMT +1.04, TGT +.14, TJX +.14, RL +.45, UAA -.31, LULU -.48, TPR unch., CPRI -.07, and XRT $36.16 +.31 (.86%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +36.89, AMZN +7.98, AAPL +5.54, FB +2.39, NFLX -1.65, NVDA +3.94, TSLA +12.31, BABA +4.50, BIDU +.84, CMG -5.75, CAT +1.96, BA -4.96, DIS (see above), and XLK $91.45 +1.37 (1.52%).\n  \n \nFINANCIALS were MIXED with GS +2.97, JPM +.01, BAC -.19, MS -.02, C -1.15, PNC -1.61, AIG +.73, TRV -.06, AXP +.62, V +2.29, and XLF $21.79 -.07 (.32%).\n \n \nOIL, $24.56 +4.17. Oil was higher overnight and the rally continued on all day.  The stocks were mixed with only the big names moving higher.  XLE closed $37.52 +.43 (1.16%).\n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,710.60 -2.70. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We were stopped out of our position in the 5/15 165 calls and I replaced them with the $163 strike.  We are also long NEM.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $8985 +50. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today\u2019s action was a continuing move higher with a high of 9560.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $10.02 + .05 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

The follow-thru from yesterday\u2019s numbers pushed PYPL +18 (14%) and LYFT +5.66 (21.7%).  Today\u2019s numbers were a mix with the hospitality booking firms the biggest losers.  BKNG was a miss and after closing $1443.91 +65 it fell as low as 1,381 -63 but bounced back to close $1,440 \u2013 only $3.91.  Trip Advisor (TRIP) was not quite so lucky.

Market internals were a bit on the soft side with NYSE A/D only 4:3 and NASDAQ 17:15.  Volume was lighter than the past few days and the DJIA had 21 up and 9 down.  The biggest losers were BA -41 and MCD -18 DPs while the gainers were UNH +37, AAPL +30 and HD +26 DPs.  All these names were higher before the last hour with AAPL trading $301 but finishing $297.80.  The news of the day on the economy was not great.  ISM Non-manufacturing Index for Aprildropped to 41.8from 52.5 in March.  50% is the breakpoint for expansion/contraction.  The trade balance showed a widening in the deficit to $44.4 billion from $39.8 in February.  Exports were down $20 billion.

NEM was a strong report and the stock, already up from $58 on Friday finished the day $64.91 +2.17 (3.46%), DIS was the big loser with volumes down due to closed parks and no production taking place at the studios.  Streaming is strong, but a big piece is being done at reduced rates or even for free.  At the close the stock was $101.06 -2.12 but after a small rally, the conference call started and after the company disclosed it is suspending its dividend for the first half it slid to 99.25.  BYND reported good sales growth and the recent closures of several major meat processing plants has been buoying prices.  The stock has rallied off an April low of $57 and closed today $100.16 +5.00 and is currently trading $105 + $5 more.\n \nTwo companies in the same business, EA and ATVI went in opposite directions.

Pinterest (PINS) had risen from a low of $10.10 last month to close $20.81 -.62 but missed on several metrics and has traded down to $16.70 and is $17.15 \u2013 3.66.  Also, on the bad news side, UAL finished $24.12 -1.14 (4.5%) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH) warned about it continuing as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d  The stock is down from $60 and finished the day $11.18 -3.26 (22.58%).\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was HIGHER with TSN +1.57, BGS +.77, FLO +.11, CAG -.03, MDLZ +.19, KHC +.02, CALM -.39, JJSF +2.66, SAFM +1.97, and LANC +7.67 (5.68%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +9.46, ABBV +4.14, REGN +32.55 (6.01%), ISRG +15.01, GILD -1.54, MYL +.05, TEVA +.31, VRTX +7.81, BHC +.10, INCY -2.17, ICPT +1.71, LABU +2.58 and IBB $127.00 +2.45 (1.97%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was LOWER with TLRY -.27, CGC +.10, CRON -.08, GWPH +.72, ACB -.012, PYX -.74, NBEV -.02, CURLF +.06, KERN -.01 and MJ $11.90 -.05 (.42%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +10.14, RTX +.15, GD +1.72, TXT -.34, NOC +6.18, BWXT +3.09 (6.05%), TDY +1.22 and ITA $147.45 +.01.\n \n \nRETAIL was MIXED with M -.06, JWN -.52, KSS -.27, DDS -1.31 (4.8%), JCP -.0145, WMT +1.04, TGT +.14, TJX +.14, RL +.45, UAA -.31, LULU -.48, TPR unch., CPRI -.07, and XRT $36.16 +.31 (.86%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +36.89, AMZN +7.98, AAPL +5.54, FB +2.39, NFLX -1.65, NVDA +3.94, TSLA +12.31, BABA +4.50, BIDU +.84, CMG -5.75, CAT +1.96, BA -4.96, DIS (see above), and XLK $91.45 +1.37 (1.52%).\n  \n \nFINANCIALS were MIXED with GS +2.97, JPM +.01, BAC -.19, MS -.02, C -1.15, PNC -1.61, AIG +.73, TRV -.06, AXP +.62, V +2.29, and XLF $21.79 -.07 (.32%).\n \n \nOIL, $24.56 +4.17.

After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We were stopped out of our position in the 5/15 165 calls and I replaced them with the $163 strike.  We are also long NEM.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $8985 +50. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today\u2019s action was a continuing move higher with a high of 9560.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $10.02 + .05 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",
