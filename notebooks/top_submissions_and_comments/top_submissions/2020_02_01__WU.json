        "selftext": "For those of you who think China has the virus under control and will cause the market to trend upwards,\n\n1. Their media lies and only speculate that they are recovering. Leading indicators like PMI tell a different story.\n2. They went absolutely ballistic in their response due to SARS fears.\n3. No other country (except Singapore) is taking the crackdown response China has. Other countries are gonna take a harder hit than China.\n4. The US in particular was inflated. You all think its from fed injection and repo markets but let me tell you, the massive bull run was primarily due to the weakness of the global economy.\n5. The world had a TINA market for the US. Foreign countries were injecting money to prop their economies up... and this money got quickly invested into the US as a safe haven. Just look at Italy's 2019 debt bubble.\n\n(Hint: domestic funds stopped investing as much cash into the US starting in 2016. We also didn't inject enough money into market to make up for the increased market cap, even if 100% were immediately invested.)\n\nAND MOST IMPORTANTLY, Chinese supply chain is a huge indicator for us. Wu flu started in 2019 and we are barely feeling it now in 2020. It'll be months before we can even think about recovering, even if China is recovered (and they're not.)\n\n\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08TLDR CUCK BULLS WHO WANDER NTO BEAR TERRITORY AND WILL BE EATEN ALIVE\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\n\nthanks for coming to my TED talk \ud83d\udc3b",

        "selftext": "(Bloomberg) -- Brigita, a director at one of China\u2019s largest car dealers, is running out of options. Her firm\u2019s 100 outlets have been closed for about a month because of the coronavirus, cash reserves are dwindling and banks are reluctant to extend deadlines on billions of yuan in debt coming due over the next few months. There are also other creditors to think about.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t pay back the bonds, it will be very, very bad,\u201d said Brigita, whose company has 10,000 employees and sells mid- to high-end car brands such as BMWs. She asked that only her first name be used and that her firm not be identified because she isn\u2019t authorized to speak to the press.\n\nWith much of China\u2019s economy still idled as authorities try to contain an epidemic that has infected more than 75,000 people, millions of companies across the country are in a race against the clock to stay afloat.\n\nA survey of small- and medium-sized Chinese companies conducted this month showed that a third of respondents only had enough cash to cover fixed expenses for a month, with another third running out within two months. Only 30% of such firms have managed to resume operations due to a complicated local government approval procedure as well as a lack of employees and financing, a government official said at a press conference on Monday.\n\nWhile China\u2019s government has cut interest rates, ordered banks to boost lending and loosened criteria for companies to restart operations, many of the nation\u2019s private businesses say they\u2019ve been unable to access the funding they need to meet upcoming deadlines for debt and salary payments. Without more financial support or a sudden rebound in China\u2019s economy, some may have to shut for good.\n\n\u201cIf China fails to contain the virus in the first quarter, I expect a vast number of small businesses would go under,\u201d said Lv Changshun, an analyst at Beijing Zhonghe Yingtai Management Consultant Co.\n\nDespite accounting for 60% of the economy and 80% of jobs in China, private businesses have long struggled to tap funding to help them expand during booms and survive crises. About two-thirds of the country\u2019s 80 million small businesses, including many mom-and-pop shops, lacked access to loans as of 2018, according to China\u2019s National Institution for Finance &amp; Development.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping over the weekend pledged a greater focus on reviving the economy, with a more proactive fiscal policy, accelerated construction projects and freer reserves for commercial lenders to unleash more funding.\n\nSupport from China\u2019s banking giants in response to the outbreak has so far been piecemeal, mostly earmarked for directly combating the virus. Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation\u2019s largest lender, has offered relief to about 5% of its small business clients.\n\nIn an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg News, ICBC said it has allocated 5.4 billion yuan ($770 million) to help companies fight the virus. \u201cWe approve qualified small businesses\u2019 loan applications as soon as they arrive,\u201d the bank said.\n\nAs a group, Chinese banks had offered about 794 billion yuan in loans related to the containment effort as of Feb. 20, according to the banking industry association, with foreign lenders such as Citigroup Inc. also lowering rates. To put that into perspective, China\u2019s small businesses typically face interest payments on about 36.9 trillion yuan of loans every quarter.\n\nStringent requirements and shortlists restrict who can access special loans earmarked by the central bank for virus-related businesses, while local governments and banks have imposed caps on the amounts, according to people familiar with the matter. A debt banker at one of China\u2019s largest brokerages said his firm opened a fast lane to ease debt sales by businesses involved in the containment effort, with borrowers required to prove they will use at least 10% of the proceeds to fight the disease.\n\nThat\u2019s of little help to a car dealership. Brigita, whose firm owes money to dozens of banks, said she has so far only reached an agreement with a handful to extend payment deadlines by two months. For now, the company is still paying salaries.\n\nMany of China\u2019s businesses were already grasping for lifelines before the virus hit, pummeled by a trade war and lending crackdown that sent economic growth to a three-decade low last year.\n\nAt most risk are the labor-intensive catering and restaurant industries, travel agencies, airlines, hotels and shopping malls, according to Lianhe Rating.\n\nYang, a property manager of a seven-story mall in Shanghai, says a tenant who runs a 150-room hotel that\u2019s usually busy has called asking for a month\u2019s rent waiver after business dried up. She expects the massage parlor that rents space in the mall is also struggling and is open to extending some help.\n\nA deputy financing director at a small developer in central Anhui province said his firm is even being denied loans under existing credit lines. A drop in sales has hurt the company\u2019s credit profile and a dearth of new projects means there\u2019s no collateral to put up. Without access to credit, the business can survive for about four months, or maybe longer if some payments can be delayed, he said.\n\nBanks are hardly any better off themselves. Many are under-capitalized and on the ropes after two years of record debt defaults. Rating firm S&amp;P Global has estimated that a prolonged emergency could cause the banking system\u2019s bad loan ratio to more than triple to about 6.3%, amounting to an increase of 5.6 trillion yuan.\n\nWu Hai, owner of Mei KTV, a chain of 100 Karaoke bars across China, took to the nation\u2019s premier outlet of discontent, social media platform WeChat, to voice his despair.\n\nKTV\u2019s bars have been closed by the government because of the virus, choking off its cash flow. The special loans from the authorities will be of little help and no bank will provide a loan without enough collateral and cash flow, he said on his official WeChat account earlier this month.\n\nWu couldn\u2019t be reached for a direct comment, but on WeChat he gave himself two months before he has to shutter his business.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/millions-chinese-firms-face-collapse-000000184.html",

        "selftext": "Chatter on message boards is reshaping the options market and sparking wild [rallies.By](https://rallies.By)\u00a0Luke Kawa\n\n(Bloomberg Businessweek) --\u00a0In a dingy corner of the internet is a message board, soaked in profanity, bro-speak, and greed, where posters with handles such as OverthrowYourMasters and yolo\\_tron campaign for their favorite stocks, putting up screenshots from their online brokerage accounts of their moonshot victories\u2014or showing off their massive losses like badges of honor. Some of them think they\u2019ve found the key to fast wins on the stock market. Wall Street doubts they\u2019re right, but it\u2019s getting nervous about what it sees there.\n\nHistory hasn\u2019t been kind to people claiming to have a magic hand. The latest sell-off, driven by a new wave of coronavirus fears, shows how quickly markets can turn on you. But even veteran traders have trouble dismissing a 900,000-user Reddit forum called\u00a0r/wallstreetbets, or r/WSB for short, whose tips and tactics have shown an uncanny ability to push prices, at least for the short term. Hitherto sleepy companies such as\u00a0Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Plug Power Inc.\u00a0went\u00a0crazy\u00a0shortly after being mentioned there. The board may have added a little froth to\u00a0Tesla Inc.\u2019s $90 billion rally.\n\nThe do-it-yourself traders of r/WSB are waging a kind of guerrilla warfare in the markets, trying to exploit what they see as weaknesses in the system to move prices where they want them. For anyone who wondered about where the small day traders who made the 1990s so wild went, meet the 2020 version. After years of indifference, individual investors seem to be finding their wayback to stocks, for\u00a0better or worse. They\u2019re flexing muscles in ways that can easily call to mind excesses from the dot-com era.\n\n\u201cThere is no denying the fact that in the month of February 2020, the public is back,\u201d says\u00a0Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at\u00a0BTIG LLC. He thinks the S&amp;P 500 can jump an extra 10% because of small-investor enthusiasm. \u201cThis bull market is not going to end until the public falls in love with stocks, and that process may just be beginning.\u201d Of course, timing the moment when irrational exuberance gives way to a mass exit isn\u2019t so easy. Chatrooms where stocks were hyped are seminal artifacts of the 1990s boom and the following bust. They were a setting for bare-fisted digital brawls among all manner of hustlers and promoters, many of whom could move shares on a dime\u2014sometimes just enough so they could get out and leave others holding the bag.\n\nTwenty years later, one thing that\u2019s changed is the nomenclature. It\u2019s frequently both juvenile and objectionable. **For Reddit\u2019s band of self-styled \u201cautists\u201d\u2014a term of endearment**, relatively speaking, that crudely leans into stereotypes surrounding extremely online people\u2014the chief prize is \u201ctendies\u201d (chicken tenders, the treat an overgrown man-child receives for being a \u201cGood Boy\u201d). Figuratively speaking, tendies are the financial rewards that follow from a successful bold wager. Bears are usually referred to in homophobic terms.\n\nWhat this moment shares with 1999 is a rising belief that someone else will come along to buy a surging stock at an even higher price, regardless of fundamentals. But while traders at the end of the millennium were willing to wait around for a \u201cgreater fool\u201d to show up, this generation believes it can conjure up those buyers through its own trading sleight of hand.\n\nFeatured in\u00a0Bloomberg Businessweek, March 2, 2020.\u00a0Subscribe now.\n\nMembers of r/WSB believe they\u2019ve discovered a kind of perpetual motion machine in the interplay of stocks with options contracts, which offer a cheap way to bet on whether shares will rise or fall without buying the stock itself. It goes like this: Members make bets that rely on market makers, the professional middlemen who sell you a \u201ccall\u201d (a bet on shares rising) or a \u201cput\u201d (a wager on a decline). Market makers, like good bookies, don\u2019t want to go out on a limb. When taking a bet, they lay off the risk. If someone buys a call, for instance, speculating on a rally, the dealer buys stock in the underlying company. If the stock rises, the dealer may have to pay out on the option\u2014but that\u2019s offset by the gain on the shares.\n\nWhen shares keep rising, managing the hedge entails buying more stock. That\u2019s where the Reddit set perceives a weakness. A favorite tactic on r/WSB is to swamp the market with call purchases early in the morning in an attempt to force dealers to keep buying stock. Up and up everything goes\u2014supposedly. As the stock price rises, so does the value of the calls, often by far more.\n\nIn this worldview, the only constraint on success is the force of one\u2019s own conviction and willingness to act upon it. An added attraction: It\u2019s all relatively cheap in terms of an option\u2019s simple dollar cost. For the price of one share of\u00a0[Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc.\u2014about $1,965 on Feb. 25\u2014a decent-size campaign can be waged in long-shot options trading for pennies. That matters nowadays, when the rise of exchange-traded funds and mutual funds has convinced U.S. companies that they no longer need to split their stocks to keep the share price manageable for retail investors. Many companies now trade for three or four figures a share.\n\nTo be clear, there\u2019s no magic money machine in options. The middlemen of the market are hardly the only players buying and selling stocks. If the rest of the market sees a reason to sell a company, it won\u2019t matter that r/WSB is pushing it. While options can produce eye-popping gains, they frequently expire worthless.\n\nBut suddenly bullish individual investors are putting their mark on the options market. How influential have they become? Typically puts are in higher demand than calls because traders are more interested in hedging against losses. That\u2019s often not the case now\u2014with some stocks, demand for the bullish calls is higher. \u201cThis is not normal,\u201d said\u00a0Amy Wu Silverman, an equity derivatives strategist at\u00a0RBC Capital Markets, on Bloomberg TV recently.\n\nBenn Eifert, chief investment officer at\u00a0QVR Advisors, was initially skeptical that the money behind these online message boards could sway anything. He changed his mind. \u201cAt least from the dealers\u201d\u2014the middlemen\u2014\u201cthey\u2019ll tell you in big tech names, flows are substantial, and it\u2019s moving things,\u201d he says. Smaller stocks are even more sensitive to sudden bursts of attention.\n\nBTIG\u2019s Emanuel says it\u2019s hard to say whether today\u2019s chatrooms or those in the late 1990s have bigger sway. \u201cWhen I was sitting in a proprietary trading room in 1999, you would see certain stocks be mentioned on message boards, and the process would then be one person saying to another, \u2018Hey, this looks interesting,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cNow you see something on a message board, and you might not necessarily see a continued discussion.\u201d Instead, computerized traders automatically jump in. \u201cAs a human you never actually see the flow because it\u2019s going electronically,\u201d Emanuel says. In other words, don\u2019t just wag a finger at message boards\u2014look at the supposedly sophisticated algorithmic traders that are following them.\n\nMembers are aware that questionable thinking underpins their bets, to the point of self-deprecation. After user SolTrainRnsOnHolGran wondered whether r/WSB\u2019s activities might constitute insider trading, a user named recentlyunearthed replied, \u201cHow can we have insider knowledge when we don\u2019t have any knowledge?\u201d\n\nThe forum\u2019s zest for call options is a key force behind a broad market trend. By one measure, the value of options traded rose 77% over the first six weeks of 2020. Much of this expansion was concentrated in a handful of stocks popular among individual investors, says\u00a0John Marshall, head of derivatives research at\u00a0Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \u201cThe size of the increase in options volumes is definitely moving the needle,\u201d he says.\n\nThe average number of contracts purchased in a single-stock option trade shrunk to just 6.7 contracts in 2020, roughly half what it was in 2015, says\u00a0Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert LLC. Looking at the combination of small orders and heavy trading volume, he concludes, \u201cReally, retail is the only audience.\u201d\n\nAs the swashbuckling day trader\u2019s imprint on the market becomes more pronounced, moderators are getting stricter in their policing of the board\u2014or \u201csub,\u201d for subreddit.
