        "selftext": "Just curious, has anyone ever told a Japanese investor from 1989 \"time in the market beats timing the market\"? \n\nHistorically, at least in America, \"buy and hold\" has been the go-to adage for investing guidance and one to live by, but just be careful in what you put your money into. A lot of companies although great, are grossly overvalued. There's a reason why the Chicago Bulls paid Michael Jordan $30M per season but not $300M. \n\nSome companies that still trade have never recovered from the Dotcom Bubble. Others took more than 15 years just to break even. Just be cognizant of that.",
