I sincerely found my study in operating systems to be absolutely profound when I was seeing the web and gaming world development ultra fast. I'm still totally blown away by it and I currently work for a fintech API. It's beautiful and has drawn my imagination for years.\n\n[Big tech dominance in the web](https://preview.redd.it/bwzq52qtjhs51.png?width=1439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b722c3c49f6aed0f2e90472a779d7ab4a560b57c)\n\nI valued the \\[redacted\\] a lot at the time because I thought that the relationship between its cryptography and heat was significant and I wondered what would become of that.\n\nToday, I still value \\[redacted\\] and I don't believe that the energy required for \\[redacted\\] is trivial.

As in, \\[redacted\\] is not a currency for people, but for machines.\n\n\\- What is the recorded work of a Walmart with a digital redesign that records QR codes on Paypal and the machining that protects it?\n\n\\- What is the recorded work of a truck that drives itself?\n\n\\- What is the recorded work of multiple automated machines working together in succession to complete a task?\n\n\\- What is the recorded work of a server that computes information that's increasingly more meaningful to you?\n\n**I decided to follow this stock seriously after learning about Lisa Su's history at Texas Instruments.** If you look at my research in my profile, you'll see that I'm profoundly interested in the development of Mexican-American modernization and synergy efforts. Texas Instruments was a core element to that due to their deep roots in embedded systems across multiple sectors (automotive and energy consumption).\n\n**I sincerely believe that AMD will acquire Xilinx for far less than 30B** and I believe that the strategy will be an entrance into the industrial automation sector in an aggressive shift while primarily focusing on energy efficiency, international compliance and regulatory needs, graphics processing, and machine-to-machine communications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Teradyne on System-on-Chip and chip needs](https://preview.redd.it/a7bwys2wjhs51.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f682177468e3e962b1364c84939337ec5570126)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n03uposyjhs51.png?width=1965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75a1e1528e1383f9a4352c777acdd77e55ab43c0\n\n[Texas instruments on industrial automation](https://preview.redd.it/3flaqr8ekhs51.png?width=1997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30dce954817e515e6f7e5513c2dbaec8351e9848)\n\nCloudflare's relationship with requests made per unit of energy",

        "selftext": "Two years ago I started investing in TER. I chose the company because it is operating in an industry with a future - semiconductors and robotics. I am very happy with the returns and would like to find some similar stocks. Basically, looking for some good long term reliable suggestions.\n\nI have some KO stock which is similar, but its a little too conventional. I also have some Apple but I don't like the made up valuations that sent it sky rotting a few months ago. Basically, something less sensational than apple, but a little more aggressive than KO.\n\nHope this makes sense!",
