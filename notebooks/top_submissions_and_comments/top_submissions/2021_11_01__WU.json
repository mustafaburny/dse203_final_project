There are also like 15 different crypto apps / exchanges.\n\nThis is the only company that offers cloud computing of mining. So bottom line - this relatively unique play in a hot sector.\n\nMoreover, Wu\u2019s influence and connections and the status of BitDeer, it should get good press.\n\nThe company:[ https://www.bitdeer.com/](https://www.bitdeer.com/) \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sddyhllc26181.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=209c858640731ea65e804e50b0f102397c573033\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7leeohe26181.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=572ccd1fc2c445bca2db7f6e408c882ab531566e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w6od1m8g26181.png?width=793&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74349fa1ca2f1770a3445768b63c3f8104a7d56c\n\n \n\n**- It is \\~60m trust, opted out of a PIPE, no options, no warrants.**\n\nGreat on multiple levels:\n\n(a) No PIPE non-sense\n\n(b) This is something tutes might need exposure too given it's nature.

News typically gets overlooked, there is a few days for a reaction in those cases.\n\n\\- Buying near NAV SPACs that has anything to do with crypto has been one of the simplest and most consistently winningest play over the past month. BKKT, CIF, CND, FCTV, XPDI \u2013 pretty much all saw an upside of 50% - 400% at one point.

        "selftext": "If you are interested in HIMX, now is the time to buy! Let's talk FY-2021 cash dividend.\n\n\\[Edited to correct grammar and typos.\\]\n\n**Background**\n\nHIMX released earnings for Q3-2021 that places year-to-date earnings at $1.69 per share. Guidance indicates further earnings of $0.745 - $0.795 per share for Q4-2021. So HIMX is effectively guiding $2.43 - $2.48 per share for FY-2021, which corresponds to a deeply undervalued forward PE of 4.62 - 4.71.  (I am using today\u2019s closing price of $11.45 as my basis for calculating the PE range.)\n\nHIMX will also be paying an annual dividend based on FY-2021 earnings. This dividend is historically declared in sometime May (or June) and paid sometime in June (or July). The dividend could be a catalyst that finally starts to move HIMX to new highs.\n\n**Dividend Table**\n\nI have prepared a table showing the dividend paid by HIMX for every fiscal year since its IPO in 2006 (see below). Its purpose is to highlight the payout ratios for each of the 13 years that HIMX has paid a dividend. The payout ratio is the proportion of HIMX\u2019s annual EPS that is paid out as a cash dividend. In the table, you can see that the payout ratio has ranged anywhere from 51.3% to 119.0%, with an average of 77.9%.  I note that three instances of the payout ratio were at 100% or above.\n\nI believe that, for Q4-2021 and similar to Q3-2021, HIMX will post earnings at the upper limit of its guidance (i.e., $0.795/share). Using the average ratio of 77.9% with FY-2021 earnings of $2.48/share, we can estimate the cash dividend for 2021 to be $1.932 per share. This estimate implies a mind-boggling forward yield of 16.9% using today\u2019s closing price. In comparison, the dividend yield for the S&amp;P 500 and the iShares Semiconductor ETF is 1.38% and 0.61%, respectively.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nHIMX pays out a very high proportion of its annual EPS as a cash dividend. To understand why, realize that Taiwan gives special tax considerations for dividends. In particular, a Taiwanese company which owns shares in another Taiwanese company is, regardless of the percentage ownership, exempt from business income tax on the dividends received from another Taiwanese company.\n\nFor example, Dr. Biing-Seng Wu is the founder and chairman of HIMX. He holds 74,579,944 ordinary shares of HIMX through two Taiwanese investment companies, i.e., Sanfair Asia Investments Ltd. and Chi-Duan Investment Co. (One ordinary share of HIMX is equal to one-half a U.S.-listed ADS and receives one-half of the dividend.) If HIMX declares a dividend of $1.932 per share, the two investment companies will collectively receive $72,044,256 *tax-free* on behalf of Dr. Wu. A similar arrangement exists for Mr. Jordan Wu, the CEO of HIMX and brother of Dr. Biing-Seng Wu.  Mr. Wu, however, has established different Taiwanese investment companies for this purpose.\n\nThe point here is that HIMX\u2019s board and executive management have a serious tax incentive to pay themselves using dividends. Moreover, because HIMX did not declare a dividend for either 2018 or 2019, the board and executive management will be highly incentivized to issue themselves a fat dividend in 2022 to make up for these missing years. So the $1.932 amount I estimated above is a very real possibility and may even be conservative.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe impending 2022 cash dividend is very bad news for anyone short HIMX. As of October 15, the short interest in HIMX sits at 24,652,040 shares (or 14.1% of the float). At an estimated forward yield of 16+%, the shorts in HIMX are deluding themselves into thinking that they can *slow-roast prime rib in front of a ravenous pride of lions and not get mauled*.\n\nThe market is going to smell HIMX\u2019s juicy dividend months in advance and start buying long before the dividend is declared. I believe the trigger point for such buying will be the Q4-2021 earnings announcement, during which, the FY-2022 EPS will be confirmed. Based on historical norms, HIMX should release Q4-2021 earnings the first week of February.\n\nIf you are interested in HIMX, now is the time to start buying. Today's post-earnings jump in price may be the start of a strong movement upward, just like November of last year.  If HIMX moves to adjust its forward yield to 5% \u2013 which would still be better than every other semiconductor stock on the NASDAQ \u2013 HIMX will move from its present price of $11.45 to north of $30. So by buying now, not only would you get to experience fantastic gains, you will most likely also be rewarded with a fat dividend (if you are willing to hold until July).\n\nReposted from u/state_of_affairs",

        "selftext": "**Remitly**\n\nTicker: RELY\n\nI\u2019ve   been meaning to write this DD for a while, and with Remitly\u2019s first quarterly earnings meeting having just concluded and the ensuing  price drop I believe right now is one of the best times for entry in this  hidden gem. While I don\u2019t believe this is going to explode on some  large catalyst, I believe there\u2019s an opportunity here for a movement to   the $45-50 levels in the next few months. We're currently sitting at a  strong support around $30. This is a fairly short and simple DD because there isn't anything crazy going on here, just a stock I believe to be trading at a tasty discount.\n\n**Who is Remitly?**\n\nRemitly is a recently IPO\u2019d company that handles international  remittances. Remittance refers to transfer of money by foreign migrants  to their   home countries. It consists of several channels such as banks,  money  transfer operators, mobile network operators, and others.  Remittance   has increased massively in recent years due to businesses  involved with  customers &amp; clients working overseas. The opportunity here is huge, there are over 280 million immigrants and the global  remittance market exceeds $1.5T annually.\n\nMain competitors include Western Union as well as MoneyGram.  However 90% of Remitly\u2019s business is driven by digital methods,  compared to 20% at these dinosaurs. Remitly\u2019s users absolutely love the  product \u2013 their app on Google Play has 285,000 reviews with a 4.8/5  rating.\n\nRELY is currently trading  close to 40% off it\u2019s IPO highs. The only  news that has come out about   Remitly since the IPO has been the  announcement of a partnership with   Facebook on their NOVI wallet to  power cash pickup in Guatemala. I  consider this type of partnership  neutral/bullish but it seems to have  been taken negatively by the market  given all the negative sentiment around Meta. I still do not believe that this drop is in any way warranted\u2026\n\nRemitly announced their Q3 2021 earnings on November 10 after market close.\n\n* Revenue totaled $121.2 million, compared to $71.8 million, up 69% (giggidy) year over year.\n* Net  loss was $13.0 million, compared to $2.4 million net loss. The  increase in Remitly\u2019s net loss was primarily due to the $6.9 million    non-cash donation of common stock in connection with their Pledge 1%  commitment, as well as incremental stock-based compensation expense.\n* Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $0.3 million, compared to $0.6 million.\n* Send volume increased to $5.2 billion, from $3.2 billion, up 61% year over year.\n* Active customers increased to 2.6 million, from 1.7 million, up 51% year over year.\n* Average revenue per active customer increased 12% year over year to $47.34.\n\n**Analyst Coverage**\n\nAnalysts have been generally quite bullish about the stock, with an  average   price target of $51, representing a \\~65% upside form the current  price   of $30.\n\n|Firm|PT|Rating|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Wolfe Research|$42|Outperform|\n|JMP Securities|$52|Market Outperform|\n|JP Morgan|$57|Overweight|\n|Goldman Sachs|$61|Buy|\n|Barclays|$48|Overweight|\n|Keybanc|$48|Overweight|\n\nCurrently sitting down about $141k/50% on today's sharp move downward. Bought an extra 300 contracts to bring my total position to 1000. Lots of time to get back at it before expiry. I closed out about $100k of gains on this on the last run from 32 &gt; 37\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u5m3i21751z71.png?width=1364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38ef8cb96ebc7c3506747904ba89a54dd9e3e5b0",

        "selftext": " \n\n# $HIMX - a potential Short squeeze play. GME X'mas special!\n\n**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company \u2013 trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\n\nThe shares are cheap in a more \u201cnormal\u201d S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\n\n2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\n\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4\u201921 and even Q1\u201922, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results \u201cto guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\\*.\\*\n\n4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year \u2013 representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\n\n5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\n\n..and now for the fun bit:\n\n6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\n\nThe amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short \u2013 and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **\u201c*****GME X\u2019mas special*****\u201d.**\n\n7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up\u2026.. and it has already shot up \\~15% last couple of weeks.\n\nDisclosure: I own stock + Jan\u201922 and Mar\u201922 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan\u201922 and $10 Mar\u201922).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bj796w0m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45a1c882d482ef89006219a463ce8d0bb0333082\n\n**What does $HIMX do? Products?**\n\nBefore we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question \u2013 here\u2019s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\n\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make \u2018panels\u2019 which are, in turn, used in:\n\n\\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\n\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n5x51h81m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfd9a80bb277f6c024707280df2ac0800213e008\n\nIn addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\n\n\\- ***High end Timing Controller***  which improves power efficiency in displays\n\n\\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ca3k5vm1m9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=511a9b8f3f27194d734ba953abd792c1f0a463fc\n\n\\- ***Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays*** \u2013 with usage in ***AR/VR glasses***, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), ***Holographic Displays***, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m77pjv02m9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8e314792dc8e053a8b92356db417b331157e7bb\n\n\\- ***Other products*** in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38rzg2g2m9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbb1a9b0dd162a6bd884be1fe1700372900883a4\n\nAs a summary \u2013 the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv1mpey2m9y71.png?width=389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71e68630d5cdb34f3e209fafdf569564206be4e2\n\n**Revenue by segment:**\n\nRevenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) \u2013 with Automotive OEM representing \\~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \\~12.5%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9wfeaf3m9y71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=075f8b8ecc9a7141c63f9854c4ef547874978c67\n\n***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***\n\nThe Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4s9t6fu3m9y71.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74eb623338023bf2a14cfef6dd3e0de7bb33e852\n\n**Competitors and Market Shares:**\n\nIn the Q3\u201921 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).\n\nYou may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqrbjnf4m9y71.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b08916e3dec038ada1c84ce6632df424645f76e\n\nAs for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3\u201921, $HIMX\u2019s market shares were:\n\n\\- Large DDIC: 10.5%\n\n\\- Smartphones: 10.4%\n\n\\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets \u2013 the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.\n\n\\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***\n\n**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**\n\n2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.\n\nCompany realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific \u201cmature nodes\u201d for its products.\n\n$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in \"mature nodes\u201d combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\n\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially\u2026. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\n\n***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** \u2013 not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.\n\nThis gamble paid off very very well \u2013 as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***\n\nThis allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/068apgs4m9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12cdaa1ee73ce6b8c1bc1c3a041b71d5441c3155\n\n**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**\n\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) \u2026..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.\n\nIn addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\n\nOn top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** \u2013 would also require components that use the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d that its DDIC business used.\n\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage \u2013 which they started preparing for, some time ago.\n\n***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***\n\n**Isn\u2019t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\n\nHowever, $HIMX was smart \u2013 it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand\u2026. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\n\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo yes, for now \u2013 the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX\u2019s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\\*.\\*\n\nNow, that\u2019s the background\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***\n\n**SHORT SQUEEZE**\n\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 \u2013 and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \u201c***GME X\u2019mas special***\u201d.\n\nSo, why do I mention a \u2018***SHORT SQUEEZE***\\*\\*\u2019\\*\\* \u2013 well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\~11 days to cover.\n\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\n\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of \u201cshort availability utilization\u201d. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201c***GME X\u2019mas special***\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6jl8ja5m9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bca75f3bff938bac1627c1ee400d55464ca456fd\n\nWith earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) \u2013 so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kdsze7o5m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8508d2baf167f705145fe82387697042098998fa\n\nAs you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun\u201921 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\n\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed \u2013 this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***\n\nI understand the short-thesis \u2013 I really do.\n\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices \u2013 could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\n\n***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance \u2013 but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***\n\nI can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4\u201921 and decent outlook for Q1\u201922) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\n\n***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay \u2013 much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***\n\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\n\n***But now, its time for a reversal.***\n\n**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**\n\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul\u201921).\n\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\n\nSo far, YTD Q3\u201921, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\n\nAn 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***\n\n***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***\n\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July \u2013 so we have some time. But let\u2019s face it, everyone can do that math \u2013 and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\n\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely \u2013 potentially through share buybacks.***\n\nCompany has bought back shares previously \u2013 and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance \u2013 so I wouldn\u2019t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\n\nAll in all \u2013 there will be significant upward pressure on the price \u2013 and although the shares have already risen \\~15% over the last few weeks, it\u2019s quite a surprise that the stock hasn\u2019t rallied much more.\n\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\n\n**A question from the \u201cGrowth Bros\u201d: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**\n\nA common question \u2013 and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\n\nBut, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses \u2013 meaning it is capex light.\n\nSo, 2 points worth noting:\n\n1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is \u2018reinvestment***\\*\\*\u2019\\*\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\n2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\n\nAlso, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\n\n\\- ***R&amp;D*** \u2013 including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\n\n\\- ***Capex*** \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\n\nIn other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their \u2018investment phase\u2019, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\n\n**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming \u2013 so, why hasn\u2019t the share price gone up then?**\n\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\n\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20\u2019s performance) as well.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fktzhqb6m9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c89e04defb6c099bc4b9bc42ffbbb8a629c300ea\n\nHedge Funds\u2019 share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 \u2013 when performance improved dramatically.\n\nMuch of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***\n\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\n\n**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn\u2019t stock kept pace?**\n\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\n\nAlthough the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it\u2019s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**\n\n**Q3 Earnings**\n\nNow \u2013 let\u2019s discuss the recent earnings\n\n***Q3\u201921 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\n\n***Q3\u201921 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2\u201921 and vs 22.3% in Q3\u201920 (guidance was 50.5-52%)\n\n**Q3\u201921 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q \u2013 the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!\n\n***Q3\u201921 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\n\nThe charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rr40ujs6m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d6018caa0a4b33ec41443087d76c3d550a707fc\n\nCharts for annual performance incl LTM Sep\u201921 and YTD Sep\u201921 are shown below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3lf7a87m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b9c7798cdad4ee62516737cc7a57c864a95efb6\n\n***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***\n\n**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**\n\nPerformance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\n\n***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:\n\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\n\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)\n\n(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\n\nWorries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure\u2026\u2026or at least that\u2019s what the shorts were betting on.\n\nBefore I go into $HIMX\u2019s guidance, let\u2019s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) \u2013 which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\n\n\\+\n\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\n\n\\- Q4\u201921 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\n\n\\- Q4\u201921 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\n\nThis Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) \u2013 so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\n\n***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***\n\n\\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\n\n\\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\n\n\\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\n\n\\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\n\nYes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***\n\nTo be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple math\u201d, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX\u2019s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.\n\nHowever, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\\*.\\*\n\n***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words \u2013 earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\n\nThis level of \u201csurprise\u201d is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s question is below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1u3gy7v7m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d297a98c6bf56b94befc9944e71213700183033\n\nThe answer to this question was pretty much that\n\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 \u2013 FY19*), and\n\nb) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers \u2013 making the demand for its products more \u2018defensive\u2019.\n\nManagement also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \u201c***again and again and again***\u201d (yes, 3 again\u2019s specifically mentioned) \u2013 and notes that guidance this time is no different.\n\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX\u2019s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings \u201cwithin guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1\u201917) \u2013 and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p91sf7e8m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d80df51e444182c244f0223e67d9318508036043\n\nSo yes \u2013 as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this \u201cagain and again and again\u201d!!! Let\u2019s just say ***management is highly credible.***\n\n**Top line guidance by segment:**\n\n\\- ***Large DDIC*** \u2013 to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market.

Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX\u2019s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\n\nInterestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is \u201cundertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features\u201d.\n\nAlso, and more importantly ***\u201csuccessful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches\u201d. i.e. ***winning more market share.***\n\n***Lots to like here.***\n\n***Automotive*** is $HIMX\u2019s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.\n\nCompany notes that the \u201cincrease in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle\u201d.\n\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alw2qvp8m9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5186906e4e3721c278f3ada2060c45e75545f7ee\n\nAs noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\\*,\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***\n\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) \u2013 which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*\n\nIn addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical\u2026\u201dto name a few\u201d. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***\n\n$HIMX also notes \u201cwithin just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company\u2019s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***\u201d. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***\n\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.\n\n***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\\*.\\*\n\n**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**\n\nThe chart below compares Himax\u2019s valuation vs peers \u2013 note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\n\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers \u2013 with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables \u2013 representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\n\nThe ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 \u2013 representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vz827099m9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e5562ad7509cb6c31d88c1def5e4a05dcdd6bda\n\nAs for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** \u2013 which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\\*!\\*\n\n***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely \u2013 as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\n\nWe haven\u2019t even discussed $HIMX\u2019s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\n\n***But I\u2019d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and \u201cin the game\u201d, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***\n\n***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** \u2013 although, that is probably some time away.\n\nFor now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.\n\n**Let\u2019s squeeze this one dry.

        "selftext": " \n\n**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company \u2013 trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\n\nThe shares are cheap in a more \u201cnormal\u201d S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\n\n2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\n\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4\u201921 and even Q1\u201922, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results \u201cto guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\\*.\\*\n\n4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year \u2013 representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\n\n5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\n\n..and now for the fun bit:\n\n6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\n\nThe amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short \u2013 and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **\u201c*****GME X\u2019mas special*****\u201d.**\n\n7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up\u2026.. and it has already shot up \\~15% last couple of weeks.\n\nDisclosure: I own stock + Jan\u201922 and Mar\u201922 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan\u201922 and $10 Mar\u201922).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o1wf2tlni9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e8b0a77c67249322e5df8ff0d9659bb732ca6d9\n\n**What does $HIMX do? Products?**\n\nBefore we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question \u2013 here\u2019s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\n\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make \u2018panels\u2019 which are, in turn, used in:\n\n\\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\n\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xauvd0foi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f100091008d982b11365eddb2f01cd44c01162e\n\nIn addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\n\n\\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays\n\n\\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/li47nu0pi9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a8868c0eb6a3fe24c5c50f5d5f9e7718ca93355\n\n\\- ***Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays*** \u2013 with usage in ***AR/VR glasses***, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), ***Holographic Displays***, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vvu6klpi9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef61f91d95755a75c3fd93469579d2319803b1e8\n\n\\- ***Other products*** in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iez5je3qi9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=787ecdcb5e97d36f62df285ebebfd01deaacb2d7\n\nAs a summary \u2013 the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6v2lpclqi9y71.png?width=389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae56cce85a11b4acad1bd9220fe384301fabff12\n\n**Revenue by segment:**\n\nRevenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) \u2013 with Automotive OEM representing \\~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \\~12.5%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8hum9v7ri9y71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e61e336fbeff67b6e15b64833d98267991f78d6f\n\n***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***\n\nThe Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ielx6ipri9y71.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44ecce802b70bee76deda31d8d5eec35f08ab3b3\n\n**Competitors and Market Shares:**\n\nIn the Q3\u201921 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).\n\nYou may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ny3uxngsi9y71.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=972f8fc3828e7e89e6e30ad4810a444f2eecbf07\n\nAs for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3\u201921, $HIMX\u2019s market shares were:\n\n\\- Large DDIC: 10.5%\n\n\\- Smartphones: 10.4%\n\n\\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets \u2013 the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.\n\n\\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***\n\n**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**\n\n2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.\n\nCompany realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific \u201cmature nodes\u201d for its products.\n\n$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in \"mature nodes\u201d combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\n\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially\u2026. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\n\n***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** \u2013 not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.\n\nThis gamble paid off very very well \u2013 as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***\n\nThis allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dy2osq4ti9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7471bbecf7cdbbeae78af1c495e4dfc1c18cca08\n\n**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**\n\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) \u2026..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.\n\nIn addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\n\nOn top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** \u2013 would also require components that use the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d that its DDIC business used.\n\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage \u2013 which they started preparing for, some time ago.\n\n***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***\n\n**Isn\u2019t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\n\nHowever, $HIMX was smart \u2013 it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand\u2026. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\n\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo yes, for now \u2013 the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX\u2019s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\\*.\\*\n\nNow, that\u2019s the background\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***\n\n**SHORT SQUEEZE**\n\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 \u2013 and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \u201c***GME X\u2019mas special***\u201d.\n\nSo, why do I mention a \u2018***SHORT SQUEEZE***\\*\\*\u2019\\*\\* \u2013 well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\~11 days to cover.\n\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\n\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of \u201cshort availability utilization\u201d. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201c***GME X\u2019mas special***\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9f23hvtti9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7dfbd7e3f672ab3504d82035e0e479551ac7b02\n\nWith earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) \u2013 so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3idfre8ui9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4484efc50e8d9e3660213ecfcb05b2a828fbe2\n\nAs you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun\u201921 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\n\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed \u2013 this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***\n\nI understand the short-thesis \u2013 I really do.\n\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices \u2013 could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\n\n***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance \u2013 but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***\n\nI can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4\u201921 and decent outlook for Q1\u201922) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\n\n***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay \u2013 much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***\n\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\n\n***But now, its time for a reversal.***\n\n**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**\n\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul\u201921).\n\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\n\nSo far, YTD Q3\u201921, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\n\nAn 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***\n\n***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***\n\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July \u2013 so we have some time. But let\u2019s face it, everyone can do that math \u2013 and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\n\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely \u2013 potentially through share buybacks.***\n\nCompany has bought back shares previously \u2013 and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance \u2013 so I wouldn\u2019t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\n\nAll in all \u2013 there will be significant upward pressure on the price \u2013 and although the shares have already risen \\~15% over the last few weeks, it\u2019s quite a surprise that the stock hasn\u2019t rallied much more.\n\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\n\n**A question from the \u201cGrowth Bros\u201d: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**\n\nA common question \u2013 and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\n\nBut, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses \u2013 meaning it is capex light.\n\nSo, 2 points worth noting:\n\n1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is \u2018reinvestment***\\*\\*\u2019\\*\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\n2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\n\nAlso, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\n\n\\- ***R&amp;D*** \u2013 including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\n\n\\- ***Capex*** \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\n\nIn other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their \u2018investment phase\u2019, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\n\n**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming \u2013 so, why hasn\u2019t the share price gone up then?**\n\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\n\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20\u2019s performance) as well.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/06tfb03vi9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ca55057da0a7bbce8c10570cbf3b69f98cac9a8\n\nHedge Funds\u2019 share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 \u2013 when performance improved dramatically.\n\nMuch of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***\n\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\n\n**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn\u2019t stock kept pace?**\n\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\n\nAlthough the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it\u2019s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**\n\n**Q3 Earnings**\n\nNow \u2013 let\u2019s discuss the recent earnings\n\n***Q3\u201921 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\n\n***Q3\u201921 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2\u201921 and vs 22.3% in Q3\u201920 (guidance was 50.5-52%)\n\n**Q3\u201921 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q \u2013 the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!\n\n***Q3\u201921 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\n\nThe charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0unbjivi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d594b0e8072fb6ecde336215b1b53a8dd306a859\n\nCharts for annual performance incl LTM Sep\u201921 and YTD Sep\u201921 are shown below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3jo922wi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ed04ce59353eb39eba145d03f6acd6de01549d6\n\n***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***\n\n**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**\n\nPerformance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\n\n***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:\n\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\n\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)\n\n(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\n\nWorries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure\u2026\u2026or at least that\u2019s what the shorts were betting on.\n\nBefore I go into $HIMX\u2019s guidance, let\u2019s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) \u2013 which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\n\n\\+\n\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\n\n\\- Q4\u201921 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\n\n\\- Q4\u201921 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\n\nThis Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) \u2013 so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\n\n***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***\n\n\\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\n\n\\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\n\n\\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\n\n\\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\n\nYes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***\n\nTo be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple math\u201d, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX\u2019s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.\n\nHowever, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\\*.\\*\n\n***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words \u2013 earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\n\nThis level of \u201csurprise\u201d is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s question is below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvps6kwwi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1b237c9ee9fb86a957c78f5298eba51ac76f8fd\n\nThe answer to this question was pretty much that\n\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 \u2013 FY19*), and\n\nb) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers \u2013 making the demand for its products more \u2018defensive\u2019.\n\nManagement also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \u201c***again and again and again***\u201d (yes, 3 again\u2019s specifically mentioned) \u2013 and notes that guidance this time is no different.\n\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX\u2019s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings \u201cwithin guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1\u201917) \u2013 and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/got3rshxi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5f649c842415a00feebddadb2d9d725450fc5f8\n\nSo yes \u2013 as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this \u201cagain and again and again\u201d!!! Let\u2019s just say ***management is highly credible.***\n\n**Top line guidance by segment:**\n\n\\- ***Large DDIC*** \u2013 to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\n\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) \u2013 ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***\n\nBy sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\n\n\\- ***Smartphones*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***\n\n\\- ***Tablet*** \\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and\n\n\\- ***Automotive*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX\u2019s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\n\nInterestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is \u201cundertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features\u201d.\n\nAlso, and more importantly ***\u201csuccessful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches\u201d. i.e. ***winning more market share.***\n\n***Lots to like here.***\n\n***Automotive*** is $HIMX\u2019s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.\n\nCompany notes that the \u201cincrease in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle\u201d.\n\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hytzjkzxi9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2040aa5b1ffb16b28ffd7400325710ed38126385\n\nAs noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\\*,\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***\n\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) \u2013 which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*\n\nIn addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical\u2026\u201dto name a few\u201d. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***\n\n$HIMX also notes \u201cwithin just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company\u2019s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***\u201d. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***\n\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.\n\n***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\\*.\\*\n\n**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**\n\nThe chart below compares Himax\u2019s valuation vs peers \u2013 note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\n\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers \u2013 with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables \u2013 representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\n\nThe ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 \u2013 representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0zr9jmyi9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f94c1451776d96781b769bcb1c4d4d564f7eb67e\n\nAs for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** \u2013 which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\\*!\\*\n\n***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely \u2013 as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\n\nWe haven\u2019t even discussed $HIMX\u2019s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\n\n***But I\u2019d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and \u201cin the game\u201d, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***\n\n***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** \u2013 although, that is probably some time away.\n\nFor now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.\n\n**Let\u2019s squeeze this one dry.

Plenty of gems on his site for even the most primitive minded of apes. \n\nHimax Trade Idea - Script\n7th November 2021\nWelcome to the Yield Fanatic\u2019s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese\nsemiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.\nThe date of write up is 7th November 2021 \u2013 as I write this, $HIMX\u2019s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn\u2019t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.\nBut as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:\nFirstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic\u2019s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.\nSecondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield\u2019s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.\nThe aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.\nAnd finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.\nTo be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.\n   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.\n $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:\n 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company \u2013 trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\n The shares are cheap in a more \u201cnormal\u201d S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\n 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4\u201921 and even Q1\u201922, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered\n\n results \u201cto guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.\n 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year \u2013 representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\n 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\n  ..and now for the fun bit:\n 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\n The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short \u2013 and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\n7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.\n  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan\u201922 and Mar\u201922 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan\u201922 and $10 Mar\u201922).\n \n What does $HIMX do? Products?\n Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question \u2013 here\u2019s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make \u2018panels\u2019 which are, in turn, used in:\n - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\n - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\n   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\n- High end Timing Controller (TCON) which improves power efficiency in displays\n   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet\n of Things (IoT) area.\n \n  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays \u2013 with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.\n \n- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)\n  As a summary \u2013 the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:\n \nRevenue by segment:\nRevenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) \u2013 with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.\n  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.\nThe Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.\n  \n Competitors and Market Shares:\nIn the Q3\u201921 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).\nYou may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.\nAs for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3\u201921, $HIMX\u2019s market shares were:\n   - Large DDIC: 10.5%\n  - Smartphones: 10.4%\n - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets \u2013 the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.\n   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%\n  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?\n2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.\nCompany realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific \u201cmature nodes\u201d for its products.\n \n $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in \"mature nodes\u201d combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\nCovid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX \u2013 not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX\n found itself in a very sweet spot.\nThis gamble paid off very very well \u2013 as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!\nThis allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\nSo what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.\nIn addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\n   \n On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) \u2013 would also require components that use the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d that its DDIC business used.\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage \u2013 which they started preparing for, some time ago.\nI guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.\nIsn\u2019t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 this is from a combination of\n  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\nHowever, $HIMX was smart \u2013 it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\nSo yes, for now \u2013 the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX\u2019s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.\nNow, that\u2019s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.\nSHORT SQUEEZE\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 \u2013 and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\nSo, why do I mention a \u2018SHORT SQUEEZE\u2019 \u2013 well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest\n  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of \u201cshort availability utilization\u201d. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\n \n With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.\n https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) \u2013 so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\n  \n As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun\u201921 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed \u2013 this could rally much much higher than previous highs.\nI understand the short-thesis \u2013 I really do.\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices \u2013 could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\nThe whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance \u2013 but recent\nguidance seems to suggest otherwise.\nI can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4\u201921 and decent outlook for Q1\u201922) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\nFrom what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay \u2013 much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\nBut now, its time for a reversal.\n   \n The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul\u201921).\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\nSo far, YTD Q3\u201921, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\n  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!\nThat, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July \u2013 so we have some time. But let\u2019s face it, everyone can do that math \u2013 and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely \u2013 potentially through share buybacks.\nCompany has bought back shares previously \u2013 and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance \u2013 so I wouldn\u2019t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\nAll in all \u2013 there will be significant upward pressure on the price \u2013 and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it\u2019s quite a surprise that the stock hasn\u2019t rallied much more.\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\nA question from the \u201cGrowth Bros\u201d: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?\nA common question \u2013 and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\n  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses \u2013 meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:\n1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is \u2018reinvestment\u2019. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\n   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\n  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\n\n - R&amp;D \u2013 including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\n  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\n In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their \u2018investment phase\u2019, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\nSo performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming \u2013 so, why hasn\u2019t\n  the share price gone up then?\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20\u2019s performance) as well.\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\n  Hedge Funds\u2019 share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 \u2013 when performance improved dramatically.\n \n Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\nSo, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn\u2019t stock kept pace?\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\n   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.\nThe belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.\nWith performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it\u2019s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!\nQ3 Earnings\nNow \u2013 let\u2019s discuss the recent earnings\nQ3\u201921 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\nQ3\u201921 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2\u201921 and vs 22.3% in Q3\u201920 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3\u201921 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q \u2013 the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3\u201921 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\n  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\n \n Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep\u201921 and YTD Sep\u201921 are shown below:\n So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.\n \n GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market\n Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\nWhy was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\n Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that\u2019s what the shorts were betting on.\nBefore I go into $HIMX\u2019s guidance, let\u2019s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) \u2013 which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\n+\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\n - Q4\u201921 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\n  - Q4\u201921 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\n This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) \u2013 so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\nBut $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:\n - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\n  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\n  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs\n prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.195 \u2192 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\n  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\n Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!\nTo be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple math\u201d, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX\u2019s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.\n \n However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.\nBut, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words \u2013 earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\nThis level of \u201csurprise\u201d is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\nMr. Lopez\u2019s question is below:\n The answer to this question was pretty much that\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 \u2013 FY19), and\n   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers \u2013 making the demand for its products more \u2018defensive\u2019.\n  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \u201cagain and\n again and again\u201d (yes, 3 again\u2019s specifically mentioned) \u2013 and notes that guidance this time is no different.\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX\u2019s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings \u201cwithin guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1\u201917) \u2013 and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.\n \n So yes \u2013 as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this \u201cagain and again and again\u201d!!! Let\u2019s just say management is highly credible.\nTop line guidance by segment:\n- Large DDIC \u2013 to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\n- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) \u2013 GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\n   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy\n - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and\n   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX\u2019s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\n Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is \u201cundertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features\u201d.\nAlso, and more importantly \u201csuccessful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches\u201d. i.e. winning more market share.\nLots to like here.\nAutomotive is $HIMX\u2019s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the \u201cincrease in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle\nis evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle\u201d.\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need\n to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\n \n As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) \u2013 which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).\n In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...\u201dto name a few\u201d. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.\n$HIMX also notes \u201cwithin just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company\u2019s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services\u201d. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.\n \n VALUATION &amp; Conclusion\nThe chart below compares Himax\u2019s valuation vs peers \u2013 note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers \u2013 with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables \u2013 representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\nThe average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 \u2013 representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\n  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA \u2013 which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!\nIs $54/share possible here? Absolutely \u2013 as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its\n existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\nWe haven\u2019t even discussed $HIMX\u2019s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\nBut I\u2019d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and \u201cin the game\u201d, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.\nYes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary \u2013 although, that is probably some time away.\nFor now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.\nLet\u2019s squeeze this one dry. GME X\u2019mas special.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company \u2013 trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\n\nThe shares are cheap in a more \u201cnormal\u201d S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\n\n2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\n\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4\u201921 and even Q1\u201922, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results \u201cto guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\\*.\\*\n\n4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year \u2013 representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\n\n5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\n\n..and now for the fun bit:\n\n6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\n\nThe amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short \u2013 and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **\u201c*****GME X\u2019mas special*****\u201d.**\n\n7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up\u2026.. and it has already shot up \\~15% last couple of weeks.\n\nDisclosure: I own stock + Jan\u201922 and Mar\u201922 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan\u201922 and $10 Mar\u201922).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gqg937dgk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b7e972ca53b36ef7a3d6f7c88066fdf2d222646\n\n**What does $HIMX do? Products?**\n\nBefore we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question \u2013 here\u2019s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\n\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make \u2018panels\u2019 which are, in turn, used in:\n\n\\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\n\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h50s60ugk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892a3056cf01889198bc457d8f82f6b8b400bfda\n\nIn addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\n\n\\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays\n\n\\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud).

So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\n\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially\u2026. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\n\n***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** \u2013 not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.\n\nThis gamble paid off very very well \u2013 as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***\n\nThis allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/phfpsc7lk9y71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105a9a81f695b40972159284b71221332b135fa3\n\n**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**\n\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) \u2026..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.\n\nIn addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\n\nOn top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** \u2013 would also require components that use the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d that its DDIC business used.\n\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage \u2013 which they started preparing for, some time ago.\n\n***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***\n\n**Isn\u2019t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\n\nHowever, $HIMX was smart \u2013 it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand\u2026. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\n\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo yes, for now \u2013 the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX\u2019s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\\*.\\*\n\nNow, that\u2019s the background\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***\n\n**SHORT SQUEEZE**\n\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 \u2013 and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \u201c***GME X\u2019mas special***\u201d.\n\nSo, why do I mention a \u2018***SHORT SQUEEZE***\\*\\*\u2019\\*\\* \u2013 well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\~11 days to cover.\n\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\n\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of \u201cshort availability utilization\u201d. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201c***GME X\u2019mas special***\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wlec4jnlk9y71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7431b6338296b82f9ee58f4cd68efcf085006046\n\nWith earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) \u2013 so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gur681mk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19567105edc88b46b8a5ecb1fb38f267d2f1a08\n\nAs you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun\u201921 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\n\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed \u2013 this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***\n\nI understand the short-thesis \u2013 I really do.\n\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices \u2013 could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\n\n***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance \u2013 but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***\n\nI can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4\u201921 and decent outlook for Q1\u201922) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\n\n***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay \u2013 much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***\n\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\n\n***But now, its time for a reversal.***\n\n**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**\n\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul\u201921).\n\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\n\nSo far, YTD Q3\u201921, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\n\nAn 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***\n\n***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***\n\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July \u2013 so we have some time. But let\u2019s face it, everyone can do that math \u2013 and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\n\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely \u2013 potentially through share buybacks.***\n\nCompany has bought back shares previously \u2013 and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance \u2013 so I wouldn\u2019t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\n\nAll in all \u2013 there will be significant upward pressure on the price \u2013 and although the shares have already risen \\~15% over the last few weeks, it\u2019s quite a surprise that the stock hasn\u2019t rallied much more.\n\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\n\n**A question from the \u201cGrowth Bros\u201d: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**\n\nA common question \u2013 and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\n\nBut, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses \u2013 meaning it is capex light.\n\nSo, 2 points worth noting:\n\n1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is \u2018reinvestment***\\*\\*\u2019\\*\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\n2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\n\nAlso, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\n\n\\- ***R&amp;D*** \u2013 including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\n\n\\- ***Capex*** \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\n\nIn other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their \u2018investment phase\u2019, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\n\n**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming \u2013 so, why hasn\u2019t the share price gone up then?**\n\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\n\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20\u2019s performance) as well.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fmymorlmk9y71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=263b1739f6cc3a650e588fdfc56d4b6738627e1c\n\nHedge Funds\u2019 share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 \u2013 when performance improved dramatically.\n\nMuch of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***\n\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\n\n**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn\u2019t stock kept pace?**\n\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\n\nAlthough the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it\u2019s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**\n\n**Q3 Earnings**\n\nNow \u2013 let\u2019s discuss the recent earnings\n\n***Q3\u201921 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\n\n***Q3\u201921 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2\u201921 and vs 22.3% in Q3\u201920 (guidance was 50.5-52%)\n\n**Q3\u201921 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q \u2013 the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!\n\n***Q3\u201921 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\n\nThe charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ekr0n3nk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8e4751d19445bcd21d6da1cbc455cd1d5ef0f60\n\nCharts for annual performance incl LTM Sep\u201921 and YTD Sep\u201921 are shown below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u308tonnk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2a6dc1c18790e454789b305b8076e44d399ca66\n\n***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance.

However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\n\n***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:\n\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\n\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)\n\n(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\n\nWorries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure\u2026\u2026or at least that\u2019s what the shorts were betting on.\n\nBefore I go into $HIMX\u2019s guidance, let\u2019s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) \u2013 which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\n\n\\+\n\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\n\n\\- Q4\u201921 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\n\n\\- Q4\u201921 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\n\nThis Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) \u2013 so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\n\n***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***\n\n\\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\n\n\\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\n\n\\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\n\n\\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\n\nYes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***\n\nTo be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple math\u201d, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX\u2019s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.\n\nHowever, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\\*.\\*\n\n***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words \u2013 earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\n\nThis level of \u201csurprise\u201d is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s question is below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7o5zrc2ok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70ace07de87afe215430326d27d1167ffd4c658c\n\nThe answer to this question was pretty much that\n\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 \u2013 FY19*), and\n\nb) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers \u2013 making the demand for its products more \u2018defensive\u2019.\n\nManagement also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \u201c***again and again and again***\u201d (yes, 3 again\u2019s specifically mentioned) \u2013 and notes that guidance this time is no different.\n\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX\u2019s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings \u201cwithin guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1\u201917) \u2013 and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s0yjfpkok9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a10edbd9f81926ce7deae84be3ff51cda607343\n\nSo yes \u2013 as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this \u201cagain and again and again\u201d!!! Let\u2019s just say ***management is highly credible.***\n\n**Top line guidance by segment:**\n\n\\- ***Large DDIC*** \u2013 to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\n\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) \u2013 ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***\n\nBy sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\n\n\\- ***Smartphones*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***\n\n\\- ***Tablet*** \\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and\n\n\\- ***Automotive*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX\u2019s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\n\nInterestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is \u201cundertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features\u201d.\n\nAlso, and more importantly ***\u201csuccessful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches\u201d. i.e. ***winning more market share.***\n\n***Lots to like here.***\n\n***Automotive*** is $HIMX\u2019s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.\n\nCompany notes that the \u201cincrease in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle\u201d.\n\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vxurb10pk9y71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f96ab1778b831b523496516c34108fc13244e799\n\nAs noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\\*,\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***\n\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) \u2013 which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*\n\nIn addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical\u2026\u201dto name a few\u201d. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***\n\n$HIMX also notes \u201cwithin just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company\u2019s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***\u201d. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***\n\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.\n\n***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\\*.\\*\n\n**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**\n\nThe chart below compares Himax\u2019s valuation vs peers \u2013 note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\n\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers \u2013 with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables \u2013 representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\n\nThe ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 \u2013 representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezz84rgpk9y71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eb5d23d015cff079b91d4871910d7cc5df88483\n\nAs for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** \u2013 which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\\*!\\*\n\n***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely \u2013 as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\n\nWe haven\u2019t even discussed $HIMX\u2019s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\n\n***But I\u2019d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and \u201cin the game\u201d, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***\n\n***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** \u2013 although, that is probably some time away.\n\nFor now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.\n\n**Let\u2019s squeeze this one dry.

        "selftext": "\n\nAgain, full credit to YieldFanatic as I\u2019m too retarded to do a DD like this one. But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatic\u2019s DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;\n\n\nHimax Trade Idea - Script (Images missing)\n7th November 2021\nWelcome to the Yield Fanatic\u2019s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese\nsemiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.\nThe date of write up is 7th November 2021 \u2013 as I write this, $HIMX\u2019s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn\u2019t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.\nBut as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:\nFirstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic\u2019s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.\nSecondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield\u2019s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.\nThe aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.\nAnd finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.\nTo be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.\n   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.\n $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:\n 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company \u2013 trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\n The shares are cheap in a more \u201cnormal\u201d S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\n 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4\u201921 and even Q1\u201922, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered\n\n results \u201cto guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.\n 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year \u2013 representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\n 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\n  ..and now for the fun bit:\n 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\n The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short \u2013 and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\n7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.\n  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan\u201922 and Mar\u201922 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan\u201922 and $10 Mar\u201922).\n \n What does $HIMX do? Products?\n Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question \u2013 here\u2019s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make \u2018panels\u2019 which are, in turn, used in:\n - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\n - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\n   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\n- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays\n   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet\n of Things (IoT) area.\n \n  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays \u2013 with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.\n \n- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)\n  As a summary \u2013 the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:\n \nRevenue by segment:\nRevenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) \u2013 with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.\n  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.\nThe Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.\n  \n Competitors and Market Shares:\nIn the Q3\u201921 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).\nYou may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.\nAs for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3\u201921, $HIMX\u2019s market shares were:\n   - Large DDIC: 10.5%\n  - Smartphones: 10.4%\n - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets \u2013 the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.\n   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%\n  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?\n2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.\nCompany realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific \u201cmature nodes\u201d for its products.\n \n $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in \"mature nodes\u201d combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\nCovid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX \u2013 not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX\n found itself in a very sweet spot.\nThis gamble paid off very very well \u2013 as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!\nThis allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\nSo what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.\nIn addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\n   \n On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) \u2013 would also require components that use the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d that its DDIC business used.\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage \u2013 which they started preparing for, some time ago.\nI guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.\nIsn\u2019t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 this is from a combination of\n  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\nHowever, $HIMX was smart \u2013 it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\nSo yes, for now \u2013 the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX\u2019s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.\nNow, that\u2019s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.\nSHORT SQUEEZE\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 \u2013 and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\nSo, why do I mention a \u2018SHORT SQUEEZE\u2019 \u2013 well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest\n  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of \u201cshort availability utilization\u201d. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\n \n With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.\n https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) \u2013 so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\n  \n As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun\u201921 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed \u2013 this could rally much much higher than previous highs.\nI understand the short-thesis \u2013 I really do.\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices \u2013 could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\nThe whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance \u2013 but recent\nguidance seems to suggest otherwise.\nI can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4\u201921 and decent outlook for Q1\u201922) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\nFrom what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay \u2013 much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\nBut now, its time for a reversal.\n   \n The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul\u201921).\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\nSo far, YTD Q3\u201921, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\n  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!\nThat, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July \u2013 so we have some time. But let\u2019s face it, everyone can do that math \u2013 and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely \u2013 potentially through share buybacks.\nCompany has bought back shares previously \u2013 and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance \u2013 so I wouldn\u2019t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\nAll in all \u2013 there will be significant upward pressure on the price \u2013 and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it\u2019s quite a surprise that the stock hasn\u2019t rallied much more.\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\nA question from the \u201cGrowth Bros\u201d: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?\nA common question \u2013 and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\n  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses \u2013 meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:\n1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is \u2018reinvestment\u2019. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\n   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\n  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\n\n - R&amp;D \u2013 including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\n  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\n In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their \u2018investment phase\u2019, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\nSo performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming \u2013 so, why hasn\u2019t\n  the share price gone up then?\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20\u2019s performance) as well.\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\n  Hedge Funds\u2019 share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 \u2013 when performance improved dramatically.\n \n Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\nSo, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn\u2019t stock kept pace?\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\n   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.\nThe belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.\nWith performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it\u2019s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!\nQ3 Earnings\nNow \u2013 let\u2019s discuss the recent earnings\nQ3\u201921 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\nQ3\u201921 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2\u201921 and vs 22.3% in Q3\u201920 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3\u201921 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q \u2013 the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3\u201921 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\n  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\n \n Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep\u201921 and YTD Sep\u201921 are shown below:\n So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.\n \n GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market\n Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\nWhy was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\n Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that\u2019s what the shorts were betting on.\nBefore I go into $HIMX\u2019s guidance, let\u2019s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) \u2013 which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\n+\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\n - Q4\u201921 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\n  - Q4\u201921 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\n This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) \u2013 so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\nBut $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:\n - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\n  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\n  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs\n prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.195 \u2192 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\n  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\n Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!\nTo be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple math\u201d, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX\u2019s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.\n \n However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.\nBut, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words \u2013 earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\nThis level of \u201csurprise\u201d is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\nMr. Lopez\u2019s question is below:\n The answer to this question was pretty much that\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 \u2013 FY19), and\n   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers \u2013 making the demand for its products more \u2018defensive\u2019.\n  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \u201cagain and\n again and again\u201d (yes, 3 again\u2019s specifically mentioned) \u2013 and notes that guidance this time is no different.\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX\u2019s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings \u201cwithin guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1\u201917) \u2013 and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.\n \n So yes \u2013 as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this \u201cagain and again and again\u201d!!! Let\u2019s just say management is highly credible.\nTop line guidance by segment:\n- Large DDIC \u2013 to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\n- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) \u2013 GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\n   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy\n - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and\n   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX\u2019s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\n Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is \u201cundertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features\u201d.\nAlso, and more importantly \u201csuccessful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches\u201d. i.e. winning more market share.\nLots to like here.\nAutomotive is $HIMX\u2019s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the \u201cincrease in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle\nis evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle\u201d.\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need\n to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\n \n As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) \u2013 which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).\n In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...\u201dto name a few\u201d. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.\n$HIMX also notes \u201cwithin just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company\u2019s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services\u201d. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.\n \n VALUATION &amp; Conclusion\nThe chart below compares Himax\u2019s valuation vs peers \u2013 note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers \u2013 with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables \u2013 representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\nThe average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 \u2013 representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\n  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA \u2013 which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!\nIs $54/share possible here? Absolutely \u2013 as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its\n existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\nWe haven\u2019t even discussed $HIMX\u2019s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\nBut I\u2019d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and \u201cin the game\u201d, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.\nYes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary \u2013 although, that is probably some time away.\nFor now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.\nLet\u2019s squeeze this one dry. GME X\u2019mas special.",

        "selftext": "**Intro**: When the $BSGA (Bitdeer) DA came out, there was little to no interest apart from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/qzo5x8/bsga_simple_uncomplicated_trade_potential/), which provided some decent but simple rationale for why it could be a good asymmetric bet. Even then, most regulars r/SPACs didn't like it given that it's a [crypto SPAC, doesn't have an investor presentation (yet), and has no PIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/qzo5x8/comment/hlnl8sz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). This was also my initial reaction, but out of curiosity I looked into it...and then I looked into it a lot more, and I've come to the realization that this is an incredible near-NAV risk/reward opportunity and that the current lack of info/investor presentation is a blessing in disguise for those who are willing to do some more digging.\n\nWith the lack of investor presentation, it's hard to tell what is Bitdeer's total hash rate and MW capacity. For those that are new to crypto miners, these are common metrics used to value these companies as it directly corresponds to how much Bitcoin it can mine per second. There may be some slight margin difference based on the individual efficiency of a miner's operations, but even still, I'd expect Bitdeer to have industry leading margins given its close ties with Bitmain and operational experience (more on this later).\n\n**Overview of Bitdeer** *(Note: the section below is quoted directly from Bitdeer's* [*Recent AMA*](https://twitter.com/Infinity_Chains/status/1463118596406603784)*, need to access Infinity Chain's Telegram Group for the actual Q&amp;A. There are some grammar mistakes as English is not the responder's first language.)*:\n\n**Q:** Starting with the most basic, can you provide a simple overview of Bitdeer?\n\n**A**: Bitdeer Group is the world\u2019s leading digital asset mining service provider, where users are provided with a full range of cryptocurrency mining and cloud hosting solutions. Furthermore, bitdeer team offer mining farm construction, miner operation and maintanence.\n\n*(Note not from AMA: Similar to XPDI (Core Scientific), Bitdeer likely both rents out hosting capacity and mines bitcoin themselves. Since this is a customer-facing AMA by a Sales Director, they don't mention it.)*\n\n**Q**: Can you provide a brief introduction to the important features/products of Bitdeer? What solutions does Bitdeer offer us?\n\n**A**: Bitdeer is a One-Stop Service Platform. Bitdeer makes it easy for any user to access a variety of services through a single platform, whether they are purchasing mining machines or seeking ways to manage hashrates. Bitdeer helps users achieve efficiency in terms of time, costs, and revenue. It takes just one click to engage in mining or manage their existing operation. Last but not least, \"Security\" equiped with 1) real-time server monitoring; 2) direct payout from mining pools; 3) fully compliant global mining operations; 4) 24/7 technical support.\n\n**Q**: What is the difference between traditional bitcoin mining and Bitdeer's miner sharing service? Why Bitdeer ? \n\n**A**: Bitdeer has removed the barriers to entry, including site construction, equipment procurement, operation management, and general maintenance. This saves time, cost, and effort for users. With just one click, the mining could be started.\n\n**Research on Bitdeer's Total MW Capacity**:\n\nStarting with the crypto mining industry as a whole, from Slide 9 of [Riot's recent Nov 17, 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_87f293457a50abdc239c88c4caf1e5c3/riotblockchain/db/447/4154/pdf/Riot+Corporate+Presentation+Q3+2021.pdf), we can see what the 2021E MW capacities look like for the majority of the publicly traded crypto miners:\n\n[\\(Riot's Latest Investor Deck, not Bideer's\\)](https://preview.redd.it/02kp5mxrnv181.png?width=1383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00fed7c2d265386d0f6d2f3013d1a2c16f2beda7)\n\nWhat about Bitdeer? I believe a fairly conservative estimate would be a total capacity of 650MW and here's why:\n\nFrom this [forkast article](https://forkast.news/headlines/crypto-miner-bitdeer-blocks-china/), published on May 27, 2021, Bitdeer was said to operate \"a 50-megawatt crypto mining farm in Norway, to which it is adding a 300 MW farm currently under construction, and it runs a 200 MW farm in the U.S.\" So, at the time, that was 250MW total with another 300MW under construction in Norway.\n\nSince then, a [Houston news source reported that Bitdeer already has a single 700MW facility](https://www.khou.com/article/news/investigations/bitcoin-mining-power-grid-concerns/285-86f94599-6239-4518-be9f-a91b4f5f481f) in Rocksdale, TX, although it doesn't specify whether it's still under construction or not. The article also says that Riot is in the process of finishing a 700MW facility in the same town. Therefore, I think it's safer to assume that Bitdeer has not finished the construction of the 700MW Rocksdale facility. Looking at Riot's progress from [50 MW on April 30, 2021 (Slide 4)](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_87f293457a50abdc239c88c4caf1e5c3/riotblockchain/db/447/4128/pdf/RIOT+HCW+Deck+4-21-21+v4.pdf) to their latest 2021E projection of 350MW, we can estimate that they expect to have completed construction on 300 of the 700MW Rockdale facility by the end of the year. From the timeline on their [homepage](https://www.riotblockchain.com/), they don't report acquiring any other mining location after the Rockdale mine, so presumably the entire jump from 50MW to 350MW is due to their Rockdale location.\n\nSo, taking Riot's Rocksdale progress as a proxy, we can infer that Bitdeer has added on another 300MW from the Rockdale location alone on top of their 250MW total reported on May 27. We can also conservatively assume that Bitdeer will have completed 100MW of the 300MW Norway farm by year's end (was under construction since May or earlier). **That would mean Bitdeer would have a total of 650MW capacity by 2021E, making it the biggest crypto mining company in the world by a significant margin.**\n\nAnother data point that can help us to confirm Bitdeer's substantial increase from its 250MW capacity reported in [May](https://forkast.news/headlines/crypto-miner-bitdeer-blocks-china/) is that at the time of that article, it mentioned Bitdeer having only 2 farms under operation.  In the recent [BGSA/Bitdeer DA announcement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitdeer-a-world-leading-technology-company-for-the-cryptocurrency-mining-community-announces-plans-to-list-on-the-nasdaq-through-merger-with-blue-safari-group-acquisition-corp-301427759.html), they state that \"Bitdeer currently operates **five** proprietary mining datacenters in the United States and Norway.\" Given that my 650MW estimate only accounts for the 2 original locations and another 2 partially completed locations, there is one more location that I'm completely not accounting for. So, 650MW should be a fairly conservative estimate. \n\nAnother [interesting data point](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/31/bitcoin-mining-giants-bitdeer-riot-blockchain-in-rockdale-texas.html): *\"**the mayor (of Rocksdale), whose son landed a full-time job with Bitdeer this year, shared a bit about the operation. According to King, Bitdeer is \u201cexpanding as fast as it can be built**...King has already fielded close to 40 inquiries from mining companies keen to set up shop there, many of whom are Chinese miners.\"* So, Bitdeer has indeed been growing rapidly this year and even has a good relationship with the mayor of a town whose power capacity is so coveted by miners, which would bode well for their future expansion plans. \n\nFor their future expansion, Bitdeer has absolutely massive plans. In their [press release](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/09/23/2302519/0/en/Bitdeer-Group-Introduces-Industry-Leading-Mining-Datacenter-Boasting-Unmatched-Capacity-and-Energy-Efficiency.html), they state that they **expect to reach 3,000MW by the end of 2023**. For comparison, Core Scientific is targeting 1,031MW by the end of 2022, which was already quite a bit higher than every other miner's projections (I couldn't find Bitdeer's 2022 MW projections but I'm guessing it'd be much higher than that). \n\nWhat does that mean for Bitdeer's valuation and stock price? From the table below, if we conservatively assume a total capacity of 650MW, its fair trading value would put the stock price at around $15-16, which is illustrated in the table below. \n\n||$BSGA (Bitdeer)|$XPDI|$MARA|$RIOT|$HIVE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Mkt Cap ($B)|4.27|5.76|5.38|4.29|1.5|\n|Enterprise Value ($B)|4|5.62|4.84|4.02|?|\n|Current Stock Price ($)|$10.20|$ 12.85|$ 52.39|$ 37.00|$ 3.96|\n|2021E Capacity (MW)|650|512|105|350|144|\n|Mkt Cap/MW ($M/MW)|7.12|11.25|51.24|12.26|10.42|\n\nFor future reference, BTC's price was $5X.XK at the time of this post. \n\nImplied $BSGA (Bitdeer) prices based on peers' Mkt Cap/MW multiples:\n\nBased on $XPDI multiple: $15.81\n\nBased on $MARA multiple: $72.00 (this seems to be an outlier for some reason)\n\nBased on $RIOT multiple: $17.22\n\nBased on $HIVE multiple: $14.64\n\n*Note: one assumption I'm making is that BSGA has the same amount of cash on its balance sheet as RIOT, so that I can more easily compare market caps and thus, stock prices. None of the crypto miners, including XPDI even after their SPAC funding, seem to have much or any cash on their balance sheet, so I don't think this assumption would change much.* \n\nConclusion: I think this is a great opportunity to get in on what is likely the biggest crypto mining company in the world trading at a substantial discount compared to its peers, with NAV protection in place. Note that [NAV is $10.10](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-141833/), so even if Bitcoin were to go to $0, this shouldn't really go below $10.00 as arbs would step in for the guaranteed redemption return.\n\nI think it'd be understandable to still be skeptical of this trade though. I've personally asked myself various questions on why this isn't as good as it seems to be. Here's a list of those questions:\n\n**FAQ**\n\n**Q**: [Isn't this a Chinese company and therefore, this might as well be luckin coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/qzo5x8/comment/hlnqfgr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)?\n\n**A**: All of Bitdeer's mining operations are in the US/Norway. Their corporate headquarters is in Singapore. Bitdeer [serves users from over 200 countries around the world](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211022005210/en/Bitdeer-Announces-Availability-of-the-Highly-Demanded-Filecoin) and none of those countries are China. Ever since China banned crypto mining in May, Bitdeer has not offered any of its services to China customers and this is confirmed in its latest [terms of use](https://www.bitdeer.com/info/125). As a bonus (for the MVST crew), [Bitdeer's Linkedin job postings](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitdeer-group/jobs/) are all purely in English and are based in Singapore or California. So to recap, none of Bitdeer's operations, offices, or customers are in China. All this to me indicates that Bitdeer is not a Chinese company.\n\n**Q**: Wait, but wasn't this formerly part of Bitmain, which was a Chinese company?\n\n**A**: Bitdeer indeed was part of Bitmain and essentially acted as their Core Scientific/MARA arm. Jihan Wu is the Chairman of Bitdeer and was one of the co-founders of Bitmain. In Jan 2021, [Bitmain and Bitdeer split](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/01/26/bitmain-co-founder-exits-resolving-years-long-power-struggle-as-mining-firm-preps-ipo/), with one co-founder taking over Bitmain and the other (Jihan Wu) taking over Bitdeer. While Bitmain is located in China, it is one of the most reputable and well-known crypto companies in the world.  For those new to crypto mining, Bitmain is the dominant supplier of bitcoin mining equipment, and [estimated to supply 80% of the market](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-17/china-s-crypto-chips-king-sets-his-sights-on-ai). The vast majority of miners that make up the fleets of companies like Core Scientific, Digital Marathon, Riot, etc., are Bitmain miners. The fact that Bitdoor was once part of Bitmain and still has them as a strategic partner, is actually a big plus for Bitdeer, given the limited supply of Bitmain miners. I'll expand on this connection more later, along with Jihan Wu's success in the industry.\n\n**Q**: Why does Bitdeer not have a PIPE?\n\n**A**: We actually have a precedence for a notable crypto company going public through SPAC without a PIPE: XPDI (Core Scientific). In XPDI's [latest S4](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-334237/), it states that \"the parties determined at that time not to proceed with the potential PIPE due to various factors, including the advantageous position that the combined company would be in relative to many SPACs due to both Core Scientific and Blockcap being cash flow positive.\" Basically, XPDI didn't really need additional funding due to being cash flow positive, and I'm quite sure the same is true for Bitdeer.\n\n**Q**: XPDI's cash trust is $345M and BSGA's is only $58M. Why would BSGA go with such a tiny SPAC?\n\n**A**: I have a suspicion on this: imagine you're a company that wants to go public but doesn't really need the funding. What's the easiest/fastest/most efficient way to do this? Well, one approach would be to look at all the SPACs without target (there are currently 500+ SPACs without a rumor or target) and identify which of them provide the least amount of funding and dilution. A smaller trust means that even if there are a high number of redemptions, you're not giving much of your company away due to future warrant exercises. BSGA was one of only 5 SPACs with a cash trust of under $60M without any warrants (all 5 of these do have 1/10 rights per unit). This would allow Bitdeer to go public without incurring much dilution or cost (I believe underwriting expense is based upon the cash trust).\n\n**Q**: Won't BSGA have a minimum cash condition that they are unlikely to meet due to high redemptions?\n\n**A**: Firstly, so far, there have X.XM shares traded of BSGA since the DA announcement, and they have all been above NAV. That would indicate that redemptions probably won't be too high. But if we assume that redemptions are very high, what would happen? We can't know for sure without an F4/S4 filing, but I suspect that they won't have a minimum cash condition. Again, this is taking cues from XPDI's [S4 filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-334237/), where they say \"because the combined company was expected to be cash flow positive, the parties also agreed to the elimination of a minimum cash condition in the merger agreement.\"\n\n**Q**: Why bother going public at all if you don't care about raising much funding?\n\n**A**: Again, same question could be asked for XPDI, but ultimately I think the answer is there are benefits to being a public company apart from raising capital. From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/advantages-disadvantages-company-going-public/), we can see a couple: \"increased public awareness of the company because IPOs often generate publicity by making their products known to a new group of potential customers\" and \"IPO also may be used by founding individuals as an exit strategy. Many venture capitalists have used IPOs to cash in on successful companies that they helped start-up.\" Note that regarding the 2nd point on VCs cashing out, SPACs cannot issue more shares while they are still a SPAC and even after merger, there is typically a 180+ day lock-up agreement for insiders. While we're on the topic, I'll also note that one of Bitdeer's major VC investors is Sequoia Capital. Notable companies that Sequoia invested in early on include Apple, Google, Oracle, Youtube, Instagram, Zoom, WhatsApp, Linkedin, and Paypal.\n\n**Q**: Some people say cloud mining is a scam, is that true?\n\n**A**: Ultimately what matters for valuing Bitdeer is its MW capacity/hashrate. So, whether it really pays out to customers who use its cloud computing platform or keeps the HODL assets for itself is somewhat secondary. Still, we should not be investing in corrupt companies. From these two Youtube reviews ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxTaOaqD_y8&amp;list=WL&amp;index=127) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzh1u-Pk_VA&amp;list=WL&amp;index=126)), we can see that Bitdeer is not a scam. The comments on this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/mh5ahn/does_anyone_use_bitdeercom/) also suggests that it's not a scam as well--users are indeed paid out their fair share. In the near future, I also plan to buy a mining plan on [Bitdeer.com](https://Bitdeer.com) and will report back with my results.\n\n**Further Intrinsic Reasons to Be Bullish on Bitdeer**:\n\nSorry, this is turning into a long post, but there's more to say. My above price target of $15-16 does not include other intrinsic characteristics of Bitdeer that arguably mean it should be valued as a premium.\n\n* Bitdeer's founder and chairman is Jihan Wu. Jihan Wu is a legend in the crypto space, having founded Bitmain (the dominant supplier of mining rigs) and Matrixport (crypto investment platform similar to Bullish, valued at +$1B). Jihan's name can bring publicity to Bitdeer and that would help get the SPAC merger some significant exposure. Given Jihan's history of starting new crypto-related industry verticals, his business plan will likely have Bitdeer expanding into other new crypto verticals/businesses besides their core mining operations.\n* Bitdeer was a part of Bitmain and still has Bitmain as a strategic partner. Given the [supply chain shortages around the world and specifically for miners](https://qz.com/2084036/even-bitcoin-is-getting-hit-by-the-supply-chain-crisis/), any mining company that can have prioritized access to new miner supplies have a distinct advantage. Considering Bitdeer/Bitmain's close connection, where formerly Bitdeer was not even a separate entity, Bitdeer should have the best access to this supply of miners.\n* My Bitdeer fair valuation of $15-16 doesn't give any value to its other businesses besides owning crypto mines: they also build, maintain, and provide supplies for other crypto miners. To date, they have [constructed over 30 mining datacenters](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptocurrency-mining-company-bitdeer-gets-221056564.html), only 5 of which do they own. They also create and sell the [Antbox](https://www.bitdeer.com/news/jifkrjts), which is an efficient plug-and-play enclosure for combining 180 Antminer S19 units together. Additionally, they have a [marketplace](https://www.bitdeer.com/market) on their website that allows other crypto mining hosters to sell their capacity to customers. All of these businesses would add additional revenue streams unique to Bitdeer. \n* Bitdeer has been constructing crypto mines since 2013, making it possibly the longest operating large-scale crypto miner. For comparison, Core Scientific started in 2017 and RIOT in 2020. Bitdeer's early start date along with the expertise it has from being a part of Bitmain should indicate that its operational execution and efficiency is industry-leading. This, combined with the fact that they've been hired to build many other crypto mines for other companies and have various technological ([Antbox](https://www.bitdeer.com/news/jifkrjts), [MiningOS](https://www.bitdeer.com/news/6xp3vta0), [Latest Miner Generations](https://www.bitdeer.com/news/1515)) innovations also support the case for their operational efficnecy prowess.\n\n**Extrinsic Reasons That Could Serve as Catalysts for Bitdeer**:\n\n* Bitcoin's price continues to make ATHs. At BTC's current price of $56K, BSGA already has quite a bit of upside as I've shared above. But what if Bitcoin goes above $70K, $80K...$100+K? I know many here, including me as I've commented multiple times, don't see crypto/BTC should be this high. Even I though, would buy some BTC if it drops down to $35K, which tells me it's more likely to make ATHs than go back down to that level. If BTC really takes off, all crypto miners will be red hot. For example, MARA went from $20 during the summer BTC's low of 30K to $80 with BTC's recent highs of $69K. The main reason for MARA's recent drop to the $50s isn't due to BTC but the fact that it [received an SEC subpoena related to one of its data centers](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/15/marathon-digital-receives-sec-subpoena-related-to-2020-hardin-data-center-agreement/) and [priced a $650M convertible note offering](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/15/2334891/0/en/Marathon-Digital-Holdings-Inc-Prices-Upsized-650-0-Million-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Offering.html). This suggests that BGSA has 4x upside simply due to BTC making another bullish run.\n* Bitdeer publishes an investor presentation or preliminary filing confirming my rough estimate of their mining capacity. From their Twitter account, Bitdeer [responded](https://twitter.com/jad_yassine/status/1462958250480087045) to someone's request for an investor presentation with \"we'll share more details when the time comes. Thanks for your suggestion \ud83d\ude0a.\" So, maybe they will publish an investor presentation at some point. At the very least, Bitdeer would have to publish the size of their operations and revenue projections in their preliminary filing. They are targeting to complete the merger in Q1 of 2022, so the prelim filing should come within the next 2 months. As I stated in my analysis, I think 650 MW is fairly conservative so their filing may show that their operations are even bigger. \n* No PIPE. No near-term dump of shares due to an S1 filing going effective. For the foreseeable futures, there will only be 5.75M shares available.\n* Low-float and possible future options. I don't really want to make a big deal of this as I feel it decreases the credibility of the invevstment, but Bitdeer's float is only 5.75M shares. If Twitter FURUs catch onto this, things could get pretty interesting. If BSGA were to also get options on top of all this, the possibility of a gamma squeeze without the impending doom of a PIPE dump would be in play.\n* Bitmain IPO. It looks like Bitmain is preparing to go public in late 2021 or early 2022 ([source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitmain-co-founder-exits-resolving-153722826.html), [source 2](https://www.investopedia.com/news/crypto-mining-giant-bitmain-going-public-4050-billion-valuation/)). Previously, Bitmain tried to go public in late 2018 with a market cap of $40-50B, but ultimately failed to as the crypto winter shortly followed. Given that BTC's price is substantially higher now and crypto mania appears to be firmly intact, if Bitmain were to IPO, its valuation may be even higher. Regardless, Bitmain's IPO would be very high-profile and bring attention to its sister company that is merging with a SPAC (Bitdeer/BSGA). This could do for Bitdeer what Rivian's IPO did for LCID/GGPI.\n* Arbs are likely soon to be out of BSGA. Since DA, X.XM of the 5.75M shares BSGA have been traded, and they have all been above NAV. If we look at XPDI's [trading history](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/xpdi/historical), we see that the price starting rising significantly once the total traded volume neared/went above the total amount of XPDI shares available. On July 21, XPDI's DA was announced and on Oct 14, XPDI's total trading volume since that time eclipsed the total 34.5M shares available. It went from $10.30 on Oct 13 to an ATH of $15 on 11/22, and is now trading **$13**. Since BSGA's total number of shares is much smaller, it'll reach &gt;5.75M shares traded since DA much sooner.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe $BSGA (Bitdeer) represents an incredible opportunity to buy the largest crypto miner in the world with NAV protection, with a valuation that implies at least \\~60% upside compared to its crypto mining peers based on BTC's current price and further potential with future bullish BTC price action. The best part? Worst case, BTC goes to $0 and you still have that sweet sweet NAV protection.\n\n*Disclosure/Disclaimer: I own a sizable position in BSGA commons. OK fine, most ($1.5M) of my portfolio is in BSGA now, but this is not a pump and dump which is hopefully clear from my post. I envision this having a natural price appreciation similar to XPDI after arbs got bought out. With arb selling pressure still intact, this is a no-brainer to me under $10.50 (NAV is $10.10). However, this is NOT financial advice, Mr. AutoMod!*",

Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\n\nThe shares are cheap in a more \u201cnormal\u201d S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\n\n2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\n\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4\u201921 and even Q1\u201922, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results \u201cto guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\\*.\\*\n\n4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year \u2013 representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\n\n5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..and now for the fun bit:\n\n6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\n\nThe amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short \u2013 and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **\u201c*****GME X\u2019mas special*****\u201d.**\n\n7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up\u2026.. and it has already shot up \\~15% last couple of weeks.\n\nDisclosure: I own stock + Jan\u201922 and Mar\u201922 calls.

So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\n\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially\u2026. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\n\n***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** \u2013 not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.\n\nThis gamble paid off very very well \u2013 as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***\n\nThis allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qea2duvrby71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afa533ebd26875345eaf4c62fc263b263fd7e147\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**\n\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) \u2026..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.\n\nIn addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\n\nOn top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** \u2013 would also require components that use the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d that its DDIC business used.\n\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage \u2013 which they started preparing for, some time ago.\n\n***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Isn\u2019t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\n\nHowever, $HIMX was smart \u2013 it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand\u2026. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\n\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo yes, for now \u2013 the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX\u2019s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\\*.\\*\n\nNow, that\u2019s the background\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHORT SQUEEZE**\n\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 \u2013 and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \u201c***GME X\u2019mas special***\u201d.\n\nSo, why do I mention a \u2018***SHORT SQUEEZE***\\*\\*\u2019\\*\\* \u2013 well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\~11 days to cover.\n\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\n\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of \u201cshort availability utilization\u201d. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201c***GME X\u2019mas special***\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0i4pnqwrby71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c93f3de4dd8eb9c3788bd14993f62d51d2214651\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) \u2013 so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r689rsjxrby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba222cfe0972ca651243195605b554e26f4d8ba\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun\u201921 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\n\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed \u2013 this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***\n\nI understand the short-thesis \u2013 I really do.\n\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices \u2013 could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\n\n***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance \u2013 but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***\n\nI can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4\u201921 and decent outlook for Q1\u201922) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\n\n***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay \u2013 much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***\n\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\n\n***But now, its time for a reversal.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**\n\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS  as a dividend (paid in Jul\u201921).\n\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\n\nSo far, YTD Q3\u201921, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\n\nAn 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***\n\n***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***\n\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July \u2013 so we have some time. But let\u2019s face it, everyone can do that math \u2013 and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\n\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely \u2013 potentially through share buybacks.***\n\nCompany has bought back shares previously \u2013 and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance \u2013 so I wouldn\u2019t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\n\nAll in all \u2013 there will be significant upward pressure on the price \u2013 and although the shares have already risen \\~15% over the last few weeks, it\u2019s quite a surprise that the stock hasn\u2019t rallied much more.\n\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A question from the \u201cGrowth Bros\u201d: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**\n\nA common question \u2013 and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\n\nBut, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses \u2013 meaning it is capex light.\n\nSo, 2 points worth noting:\n\n1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is \u2018reinvestment***\\*\\*\u2019\\*\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\n2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\n\nAlso, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\n\n\\- ***R&amp;D*** \u2013 including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\n\n\\- ***Capex*** \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\n\nIn other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their \u2018investment phase\u2019, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming \u2013 so, why hasn\u2019t the share price gone up then?**\n\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\n\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20\u2019s performance) as well.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycrah2gzrby71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22fbdf056d2a59dae4f167ab2af4342d1155f6ea\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHedge Funds\u2019 share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 \u2013 when performance improved dramatically.\n\nMuch of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***\n\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn\u2019t stock kept pace?**\n\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\n\nAlthough the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it\u2019s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q3 Earnings**\n\nNow \u2013 let\u2019s discuss the recent earnings\n\n***Q3\u201921 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\n\n***Q3\u201921 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2\u201921 and vs 22.3% in Q3\u201920 (guidance was 50.5-52%)\n\n**Q3\u201921 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q \u2013 the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!\n\n***Q3\u201921 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\n\nThe charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iafp0w21sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f09a541b8919354aeb49d2d8d134fa89caa4b170\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharts for annual performance incl LTM Sep\u201921 and YTD Sep\u201921 are shown below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahwxlw42sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c6a50f51cc7ed5113acb1e1646a677bc13d6d5e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**\n\nPerformance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\n\n***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:\n\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\n\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)\n\n(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\n\nWorries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure\u2026\u2026or at least that\u2019s what the shorts were betting on.\n\nBefore I go into $HIMX\u2019s guidance, let\u2019s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) \u2013 which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\n\n\\+\n\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\n\n\\- Q4\u201921 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\n\n\\- Q4\u201921 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\n\nThis Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) \u2013 so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\n\n***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***\n\n\\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\n\n\\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\n\n\\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\n\n\\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\n\nYes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***\n\nTo be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to  its customers anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple math\u201d, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX\u2019s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 50%.\n\nHowever, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 47.6% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\\*.\\*\n\n***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words \u2013 earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\n\nThis level of \u201csurprise\u201d is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s question is below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bet6o463sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ae1b659f263b95c39d8baa62943b9e8d944ce87\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe answer to this question was pretty much that\n\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 \u2013 FY19*), and\n\nb) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers \u2013 making the demand for its products more \u2018defensive\u2019.\n\nManagement also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \u201c***again and again and again***\u201d (yes, 3 again\u2019s specifically mentioned) \u2013 and notes that guidance this time is no different.\n\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX\u2019s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings \u201cwithin guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1\u201917) \u2013 and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohq8i754sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d248a679dccc3f7cdcc8652297c727bd8356c78\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yes \u2013 as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this \u201cagain and again and again\u201d!!! Let\u2019s just say ***management is highly credible.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Top line guidance by segment:**\n\n\\- ***Large DDIC*** \u2013 to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\n\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) \u2013 ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***\n\nBy sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\n\n\\- ***Smartphones*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***\n\n\\- ***Tablet*** \\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and\n\n\\- ***Automotive*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX\u2019s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\n\nInterestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is \u201cundertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features\u201d.\n\nAlso, and more importantly ***\u201csuccessful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches\u201d. i.e. ***winning more market share.***\n\n***Lots to like here.***\n\n***Automotive*** is $HIMX\u2019s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.\n\nCompany notes that the \u201cincrease in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle\u201d.\n\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fafsthl5sby71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1b593a646120e9a85282d0a7bf396dc938b5b23\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\\*,\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***\n\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) \u2013 which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*\n\nIn addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical\u2026\u201dto name a few\u201d. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***\n\n$HIMX also notes \u201cwithin just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company\u2019s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***\u201d. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***\n\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.\n\n***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\\*.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**\n\nThe chart below compares Himax\u2019s valuation vs peers \u2013 note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\n\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers \u2013 with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables \u2013 representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\n\nThe ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 \u2013 representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgpjwx26sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3143bcb1893e5c70decac03bad63633475a57b1b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** \u2013 which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\\*!\\*\n\n***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely \u2013 as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\n\nWe haven\u2019t even discussed $HIMX\u2019s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\n\n***But I\u2019d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and \u201cin the game\u201d, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***\n\n***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** \u2013 although, that is probably some time away.\n\nFor now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.\n\n**Let\u2019s squeeze this one dry.

But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatic\u2019s DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;\n\n\n(Images missing)\n7th November 2021\nWelcome to the Yield Fanatic\u2019s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese\nsemiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.\nThe date of write up is 7th November 2021 \u2013 as I write this, $HIMX\u2019s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn\u2019t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.\nBut as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:\nFirstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic\u2019s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.\nSecondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield\u2019s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.\nThe aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.\nAnd finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.\nTo be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.\n   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.\n $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:\n 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company \u2013 trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\n The shares are cheap in a more \u201cnormal\u201d S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\n 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4\u201921 and even Q1\u201922, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered\n\n results \u201cto guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.\n 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year \u2013 representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\n 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\n  ..and now for the fun bit:\n 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\n The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short \u2013 and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\n7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.\n  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan\u201922 and Mar\u201922 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan\u201922 and $10 Mar\u201922).\n \n What does $HIMX do? Products?\n Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question \u2013 here\u2019s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make \u2018panels\u2019 which are, in turn, used in:\n - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\n - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\n   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\n- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays\n   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet\n of Things (IoT) area.\n \n  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays \u2013 with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.\n \n- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)\n  As a summary \u2013 the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:\n \nRevenue by segment:\nRevenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) \u2013 with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.\n  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.\nThe Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.\n  \n Competitors and Market Shares:\nIn the Q3\u201921 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).\nYou may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.\nAs for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3\u201921, $HIMX\u2019s market shares were:\n   - Large DDIC: 10.5%\n  - Smartphones: 10.4%\n - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets \u2013 the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.\n   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%\n  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?\n2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.\nCompany realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific \u201cmature nodes\u201d for its products.\n \n $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in \"mature nodes\u201d combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\nCovid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX \u2013 not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX\n found itself in a very sweet spot.\nThis gamble paid off very very well \u2013 as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!\nThis allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\nSo what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.\nIn addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\n   \n On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) \u2013 would also require components that use the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d that its DDIC business used.\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage \u2013 which they started preparing for, some time ago.\nI guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.\nIsn\u2019t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 this is from a combination of\n  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\nHowever, $HIMX was smart \u2013 it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\nSo yes, for now \u2013 the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX\u2019s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.\nNow, that\u2019s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.\nSHORT SQUEEZE\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 \u2013 and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\nSo, why do I mention a \u2018SHORT SQUEEZE\u2019 \u2013 well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest\n  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of \u201cshort availability utilization\u201d. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\n \n With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.\n https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) \u2013 so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\n  \n As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun\u201921 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed \u2013 this could rally much much higher than previous highs.\nI understand the short-thesis \u2013 I really do.\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices \u2013 could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\nThe whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance \u2013 but recent\nguidance seems to suggest otherwise.\nI can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4\u201921 and decent outlook for Q1\u201922) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\nFrom what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay \u2013 much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\nBut now, its time for a reversal.\n   \n The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul\u201921).\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\nSo far, YTD Q3\u201921, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\n  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!\nThat, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July \u2013 so we have some time. But let\u2019s face it, everyone can do that math \u2013 and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely \u2013 potentially through share buybacks.\nCompany has bought back shares previously \u2013 and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance \u2013 so I wouldn\u2019t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\nAll in all \u2013 there will be significant upward pressure on the price \u2013 and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it\u2019s quite a surprise that the stock hasn\u2019t rallied much more.\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\nA question from the \u201cGrowth Bros\u201d: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?\nA common question \u2013 and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\n  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses \u2013 meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:\n1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is \u2018reinvestment\u2019. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\n   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\n  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\n\n - R&amp;D \u2013 including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\n  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\n In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their \u2018investment phase\u2019, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\nSo performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming \u2013 so, why hasn\u2019t\n  the share price gone up then?\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20\u2019s performance) as well.\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\n  Hedge Funds\u2019 share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 \u2013 when performance improved dramatically.\n \n Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\nSo, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn\u2019t stock kept pace?\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\n   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.\nThe belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.\nWith performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it\u2019s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!\nQ3 Earnings\nNow \u2013 let\u2019s discuss the recent earnings\nQ3\u201921 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\nQ3\u201921 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2\u201921 and vs 22.3% in Q3\u201920 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3\u201921 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q \u2013 the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3\u201921 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\n  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\n \n Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep\u201921 and YTD Sep\u201921 are shown below:\n So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.\n \n GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market\n Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\nWhy was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\n Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that\u2019s what the shorts were betting on.\nBefore I go into $HIMX\u2019s guidance, let\u2019s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) \u2013 which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\n+\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\n - Q4\u201921 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\n  - Q4\u201921 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\n This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) \u2013 so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\nBut $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:\n - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\n  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\n  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs\n prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.195 \u2192 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\n  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\n Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!\nTo be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple math\u201d, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX\u2019s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.\n \n However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.\nBut, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words \u2013 earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\nThis level of \u201csurprise\u201d is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\nMr. Lopez\u2019s question is below:\n The answer to this question was pretty much that\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 \u2013 FY19), and\n   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers \u2013 making the demand for its products more \u2018defensive\u2019.\n  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \u201cagain and\n again and again\u201d (yes, 3 again\u2019s specifically mentioned) \u2013 and notes that guidance this time is no different.\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX\u2019s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings \u201cwithin guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1\u201917) \u2013 and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.\n \n So yes \u2013 as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this \u201cagain and again and again\u201d!!! Let\u2019s just say management is highly credible.\nTop line guidance by segment:\n- Large DDIC \u2013 to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\n- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) \u2013 GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\n   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy\n - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and\n   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX\u2019s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\n Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is \u201cundertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features\u201d.\nAlso, and more importantly \u201csuccessful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches\u201d. i.e. winning more market share.\nLots to like here.\nAutomotive is $HIMX\u2019s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the \u201cincrease in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle\nis evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle\u201d.\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need\n to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\n \n As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) \u2013 which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).\n In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...\u201dto name a few\u201d. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.\n$HIMX also notes \u201cwithin just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company\u2019s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services\u201d. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.\n \n VALUATION &amp; Conclusion\nThe chart below compares Himax\u2019s valuation vs peers \u2013 note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers \u2013 with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables \u2013 representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\nThe average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 \u2013 representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\n  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA \u2013 which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!\nIs $54/share possible here? Absolutely \u2013 as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its\n existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\nWe haven\u2019t even discussed $HIMX\u2019s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\nBut I\u2019d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and \u201cin the game\u201d, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.\nYes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary \u2013 although, that is probably some time away.\nFor now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.\nLet\u2019s squeeze this one dry. GME X\u2019mas special.\n\n\n\n\nPositions: 2k shares 50 dec 17 $13c",

Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company \u2013 trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe shares are cheap in a more \u201cnormal\u201d S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as \\*\\*\\*stupid cheap\\*\\*\\* with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4\u201921 and even Q1\u201922, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have \\*\\*\\*consistently delivered results \u201cto guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\*.\\\\\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year \u2013 representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..and now for the fun bit:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. \\*\\*\\*Potential for a significant short squeeze\\*\\*\\*. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\\\\\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\\\\\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short \u2013 and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \\*\\*\u201c\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*GME X\u2019mas special\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\u201d.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. Cant confirm this (\\*\\*\\*unconfirmed hearsay\\*\\*\\*) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an \\*\\*\\*Asian hedge fund\\*\\*\\* which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up\u2026.. and it has already shot up \\\\\\~15% last couple of weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I own stock + Jan\u201922 and Mar\u201922 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes.

Products?\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question \u2013 here\u2019s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make \u2018panels\u2019 which are, in turn, used in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Large sized DDICs\\*\\*\\* \\\\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs\\*\\*\\* \\\\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*High end Timing Controller \\*\\*\\* which improves power efficiency in displays\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*WiseEye ultra power AI\\*\\*\\* \\\\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ \\*\\*\\*AI and ML\\*\\*\\* to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays\\*\\*\\* \u2013 with usage in \\*\\*\\*AR/VR glasses\\*\\*\\*, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), \\*\\*\\*Holographic Displays\\*\\*\\*, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Other products\\*\\*\\* in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a summary \u2013 the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Revenue by segment:\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRevenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) \u2013 with Automotive OEM representing \\\\\\~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \\\\\\~12.5%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Competitors and Market Shares:\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the Q3\u201921 presentation (available \\[here\\]([https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21\\_HIMX-Investor-Presentation\\_FInal.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf))), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for \\*\\*\\*market share\\*\\*\\* by the individual segments, as of Q3\u201921, $HIMX\u2019s market shares were:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- Large DDIC: 10.5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- Smartphones: 10.4%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Tablets: 37.7%\\*\\*\\* but note that \\*\\*\\*$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share\\*\\*\\* of Android / non iOS tablets \u2013 the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Automotive OEM: 32.8%\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*So, what has been happening recently with Himax?\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompany realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific \u201cmature nodes\u201d for its products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$HIMX management \\*\\*\\*foresaw\\*\\*\\* that this historical lack of investment in \"mature nodes\u201d combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially\u2026. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX\\*\\*\\* \u2013 not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis gamble paid off very very well \u2013 as demand spiked. \\*\\*\\*When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),\\*\\*\\* \\[\\*\\*\\*$HIMX\\*\\*\\*\\]([https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag\\_click](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click)) \\*\\*\\*walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis allowed it to \\*\\*\\*take a decent amount of market share\\*\\*\\* over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) \u2026..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like \\*\\*\\*Internet of Things (IoT)\\*\\*\\* and \\*\\*\\*Automotive/vehicles\\*\\*\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, the \\*\\*\\*modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)\\*\\*\\* would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that \\*\\*\\*this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly\\*\\*\\*. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such \\*\\*\\*5G and high performance computing (HPC)\\*\\*\\* \u2013 would also require components that use the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d that its DDIC business used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage \u2013 which they started preparing for, some time ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Isn\u2019t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, $HIMX was smart \u2013 it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand\u2026. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yes, for now \u2013 the demand will persist, and as management has said, \\*\\*\\*this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX\u2019s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\*.\\\\\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, that\u2019s the background\\\\\\*\\\\\\*.\\\\\\*\\\\\\* \\*\\*\\*Supply secured along with said demand.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*SHORT SQUEEZE\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear \\*\\*\\*Short Squeeze\\*\\*\\* candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 \u2013 and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \u201c\\*\\*\\*GME X\u2019mas special\\*\\*\\*\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, why do I mention a \u2018\\*\\*\\*SHORT SQUEEZE\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\u2019\\\\\\*\\\\\\* \u2013 well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\\\\\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\\\\\~11 days to cover.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of \u201cshort availability utilization\u201d. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201c\\*\\*\\*GME X\u2019mas special\\*\\*\\*\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, \\*\\*\\*there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)\\]([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX)) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) \u2013 so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun\u201921 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. \\*\\*\\*I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed \u2013 this could rally much much higher than previous highs.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand the short-thesis \u2013 I really do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices \u2013 could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance \u2013 but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can personally find \\*\\*\\*NO REASON\\*\\*\\* to be short this stock anymore at least for the \\*\\*\\*next 7 months\\*\\*\\*, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4\u201921 and decent outlook for Q1\u201922) and then we will have a \\*\\*\\*dividend payment\\*\\*\\* in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay \u2013 much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*But now, its time for a reversal.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul\u201921).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\\\\\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far, YTD Q3\u201921, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a \\*\\*\\*dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July \u2013 so we have some time. But let\u2019s face it, everyone can do that math \u2013 and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. \\*\\*\\*An earlier distribution is also likely \u2013 potentially through share buybacks.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompany has bought back shares previously \u2013 and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance \u2013 so I wouldn\u2019t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all \u2013 there will be significant upward pressure on the price \u2013 and although the shares have already risen \\\\\\~15% over the last few weeks, it\u2019s quite a surprise that the stock hasn\u2019t rallied much more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*A question from the \u201cGrowth Bros\u201d: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA common question \u2013 and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses \u2013 meaning it is capex light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, 2 points worth noting:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. \\*\\*\\*Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is \u2018reinvestment\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\u2019\\\\\\*\\\\\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\n\n2. \\*\\*\\*Reasonably capex-light business\\*\\*\\*: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*R&amp;D\\*\\*\\* \u2013 including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Capex\\*\\*\\* \\\\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their \u2018investment phase\u2019, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming \u2013 so, why hasn\u2019t the share price gone up then?\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20\u2019s performance) as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHedge Funds\u2019 share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 \u2013 when performance improved dramatically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuch of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. \\*\\*\\*The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn\u2019t stock kept pace?\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. \\*\\*\\*More on valuation at the end\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*.\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!\\*\\*\\* Folks believe that this stock is \\*\\*\\*manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)\\*\\*\\* who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\\\\\*\\\\\\*.\\\\\\*\\\\\\* \\*\\*\\*Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*.\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it\u2019s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Q3 Earnings\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow \u2013 let\u2019s discuss the recent earnings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Q3\u201921 revenue\\*\\*\\*: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Q3\u201921 gross margin\\*\\*\\*: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2\u201921 and vs 22.3% in Q3\u201920 (guidance was 50.5-52%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Q3\u201921 EBITDA\\*\\*: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q \u2013 the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Q3\u201921 Levered FCF\\*\\*\\* of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharts for annual performance incl LTM Sep\u201921 and YTD Sep\u201921 are shown below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerformance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Why was the market waiting on guidance?\\*\\*\\* Because indications were that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure\u2026\u2026or at least that\u2019s what the shorts were betting on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I go into $HIMX\u2019s guidance, let\u2019s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) \u2013 which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\+\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- Q4\u201921 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- Q4\u201921 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) \u2013 so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Q4 revenue\\*\\*\\* would \\*\\*\\*INCREASE\\*\\*\\* by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Gross margin\\*\\*\\*: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Q4 IFRS EPS\\*\\*\\* (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Q4 non IFRS EPS\\*\\*\\* (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) \\*\\*\\*but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be fair, the \\*\\*\\*margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect\\*\\*\\* than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple math\u201d, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX\u2019s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; \\*\\*\\*a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\*.\\\\\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.\\*\\*\\* In other words \u2013 earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis level of \u201csurprise\u201d is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s question is below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe answer to this question was pretty much that\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (\\*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 \u2013 FY19\\*), and\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers \u2013 making the demand for its products more \u2018defensive\u2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nManagement also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \u201c\\*\\*\\*again and again and again\\*\\*\\*\u201d (yes, 3 again\u2019s specifically mentioned) \u2013 and notes that guidance this time is no different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX\u2019s historical guidance, you will see that the company has \\*\\*\\*consistently delivered earnings \u201cwithin guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1\u201917) \u2013 and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yes \u2013 as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this \u201cagain and again and again\u201d!!! Let\u2019s just say \\*\\*\\*management is highly credible.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Top line guidance by segment:\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Large DDIC\\*\\*\\* \u2013 to \\*\\*\\*GROW\\*\\*\\* by \\*\\*\\*high single digit q-o-q\\*\\*\\* helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC\\*\\*\\* (overall) \u2013 \\*\\*\\*GROW\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*low teens q-o-q\\*\\*\\* and \\*\\*\\*&gt;50% yoy\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Smartphones\\*\\*\\* \\\\-&gt; \\*\\*\\*GROW\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*high teens q-o-q\\*\\*\\* &amp; \\*\\*\\*&gt;30% yoy\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Tablet\\*\\*\\* \\\\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- \\*\\*\\*Automotive\\*\\*\\* \\\\-&gt; \\*\\*\\*GROW\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*double-digit q-o-q\\*\\*\\* and \\*\\*\\*&gt;100% yoy\\*\\*\\*. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX\u2019s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInterestingly within the \\*\\*\\*Smartphone\\*\\*\\* segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is \u201cundertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, and more importantly \\*\\*\\*\u201csuccessful engagements with some key customers\\*\\*\\* have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches\u201d. i.e. \\*\\*\\*winning more market share.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Lots to like here.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Automotive\\*\\*\\* is $HIMX\u2019s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompany notes that the \u201cincrease in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs noted earlier, $HIMX also has a \\*\\*\\*non-DDIC segment\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\*,\\\\\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for \\*\\*\\*AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a \\*\\*\\*design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application\\*\\*\\* (industrial application, from what I gather) \u2013 which is \\*\\*\\*on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)\\*\\*\\*\\*.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, $HIMX also notes that the \\*\\*\\*number of awarded projects\\*\\*\\* in this segment is \\*\\*\\*growing rapidly\\*\\*\\*, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical\u2026\u201dto name a few\u201d. \\*\\*\\*Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$HIMX also notes \u201cwithin just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company\u2019s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from \\*\\*\\*cloud service providers\\*\\*\\* who look for \\*\\*\\*secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services\\*\\*\\*\u201d.

Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables \u2013 representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe \\*\\*\\*average fair value\\*\\*\\* on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 \u2013 representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for \\*\\*\\*transaction comps\\*\\*\\*, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents \\*\\*\\*21x EV/EBITDA\\*\\*\\* \u2013 which if applied to $HIMX, gives a \\*\\*\\*FV of $54/share + 370% upside\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\*!\\\\\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Is $54/share possible here?\\*\\*\\* Absolutely \u2013 as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining.

But to be fair I tried to tell you retards about HIMAX a while back. YieldFanatic\u2019s DD is more on the spectrum than mine though;\n\n\n(Images missing)\n7th November 2021\nWelcome to the Yield Fanatic\u2019s Trade Idea series. This write up is on the Taiwanese\nsemiconductor business, Himax. The shares are listed on NASDAQ and the ticker is $HIMX.\nThe date of write up is 7th November 2021 \u2013 as I write this, $HIMX\u2019s current share price is $11.45 and market cap is roughly $2.0 billion. Note that this isn\u2019t part of the deep dive series like I mostly present but rather a unique tactical trade idea given where this company trades at the moment.\nBut as always, before we start, the disclaimer. A few points worth noting:\nFirstly, this is not investment advice nor is it a recommendation to buy or sell any security. This is just the Yield Fanatic\u2019s opinion of the stock in question. If you wish to seek advice, please do so from an accredited financial advisor, which the Yield Fanatic is not.\nSecondly, the opinion shown in this presentation is based on Yield\u2019s read of things. Your view may be different based on your read of things, but it is the difference in views and opinion that makes a market.\nThe aim of this write up and recording is to give you an unbiased VIEW of the opportunity in question. The aim is to give you all the data that you need to make your own decision.\nAnd finally, the Yield Fanatic does have a position in Himax at present and so, the opinions expressed here may be biased. This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.\nTo be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.\n   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.\n $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:\n 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company \u2013 trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\n The shares are cheap in a more \u201cnormal\u201d S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\n 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4\u201921 and even Q1\u201922, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered\n\n results \u201cto guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.\n 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year \u2013 representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\n 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\n  ..and now for the fun bit:\n 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\n The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short \u2013 and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\n7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.\n  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan\u201922 and Mar\u201922 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan\u201922 and $10 Mar\u201922).\n \n What does $HIMX do? Products?\n Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question \u2013 here\u2019s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make \u2018panels\u2019 which are, in turn, used in:\n - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\n - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\n   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\n- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays\n   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet\n of Things (IoT) area.\n \n  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays \u2013 with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.\n \n- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)\n  As a summary \u2013 the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:\n \nRevenue by segment:\nRevenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) \u2013 with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.\n  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.\nThe Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.\n  \n Competitors and Market Shares:\nIn the Q3\u201921 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).\nYou may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.\nAs for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3\u201921, $HIMX\u2019s market shares were:\n   - Large DDIC: 10.5%\n  - Smartphones: 10.4%\n - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets \u2013 the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.\n   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%\n  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?\n2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.\nCompany realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific \u201cmature nodes\u201d for its products.\n \n $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in \"mature nodes\u201d combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\nCovid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX \u2013 not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX\n found itself in a very sweet spot.\nThis gamble paid off very very well \u2013 as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!\nThis allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\nSo what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.\nIn addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\n   \n On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) \u2013 would also require components that use the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d that its DDIC business used.\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage \u2013 which they started preparing for, some time ago.\nI guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.\nIsn\u2019t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 this is from a combination of\n  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\nHowever, $HIMX was smart \u2013 it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\nSo yes, for now \u2013 the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX\u2019s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.\nNow, that\u2019s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.\nSHORT SQUEEZE\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 \u2013 and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\nSo, why do I mention a \u2018SHORT SQUEEZE\u2019 \u2013 well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest\n  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of \u201cshort availability utilization\u201d. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\n \n With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.\n https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) \u2013 so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\n  \n As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun\u201921 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed \u2013 this could rally much much higher than previous highs.\nI understand the short-thesis \u2013 I really do.\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices \u2013 could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\nThe whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance \u2013 but recent\nguidance seems to suggest otherwise.\nI can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4\u201921 and decent outlook for Q1\u201922) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\nFrom what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay \u2013 much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\nBut now, its time for a reversal.\n   \n The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul\u201921).\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\nSo far, YTD Q3\u201921, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\n  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!\nThat, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July \u2013 so we have some time. But let\u2019s face it, everyone can do that math \u2013 and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely \u2013 potentially through share buybacks.\nCompany has bought back shares previously \u2013 and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance \u2013 so I wouldn\u2019t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\nAll in all \u2013 there will be significant upward pressure on the price \u2013 and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it\u2019s quite a surprise that the stock hasn\u2019t rallied much more.\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\nA question from the \u201cGrowth Bros\u201d: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?\nA common question \u2013 and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\n  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses \u2013 meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:\n1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is \u2018reinvestment\u2019. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\n   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\n  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\n\n - R&amp;D \u2013 including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\n  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\n In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their \u2018investment phase\u2019, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\nSo performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming \u2013 so, why hasn\u2019t\n  the share price gone up then?\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20\u2019s performance) as well.\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\n  Hedge Funds\u2019 share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 \u2013 when performance improved dramatically.\n \n Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\nSo, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn\u2019t stock kept pace?\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\n   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.\nThe belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.\nWith performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it\u2019s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!\nQ3 Earnings\nNow \u2013 let\u2019s discuss the recent earnings\nQ3\u201921 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\nQ3\u201921 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2\u201921 and vs 22.3% in Q3\u201920 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3\u201921 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q \u2013 the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3\u201921 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\n  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\n \n Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep\u201921 and YTD Sep\u201921 are shown below:\n So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.\n \n GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market\n Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\nWhy was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\n Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that\u2019s what the shorts were betting on.\nBefore I go into $HIMX\u2019s guidance, let\u2019s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) \u2013 which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\n+\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\n - Q4\u201921 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\n  - Q4\u201921 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\n This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) \u2013 so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\nBut $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:\n - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\n  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\n  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs\n prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.195 \u2192 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\n  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\n Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!\nTo be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple math\u201d, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX\u2019s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.\n \n However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.\nBut, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words \u2013 earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\nThis level of \u201csurprise\u201d is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\nMr. Lopez\u2019s question is below:\n The answer to this question was pretty much that\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 \u2013 FY19), and\n   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers \u2013 making the demand for its products more \u2018defensive\u2019.\n  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \u201cagain and\n again and again\u201d (yes, 3 again\u2019s specifically mentioned) \u2013 and notes that guidance this time is no different.\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX\u2019s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings \u201cwithin guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1\u201917) \u2013 and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.\n \n So yes \u2013 as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this \u201cagain and again and again\u201d!!! Let\u2019s just say management is highly credible.\nTop line guidance by segment:\n- Large DDIC \u2013 to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\n- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) \u2013 GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\n   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy\n - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and\n   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX\u2019s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\n Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is \u201cundertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features\u201d.\nAlso, and more importantly \u201csuccessful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches\u201d. i.e. winning more market share.\nLots to like here.\nAutomotive is $HIMX\u2019s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the \u201cincrease in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle\nis evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle\u201d.\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need\n to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\n \n As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) \u2013 which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).\n In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...\u201dto name a few\u201d. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.\n$HIMX also notes \u201cwithin just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company\u2019s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services\u201d. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.\n \n VALUATION &amp; Conclusion\nThe chart below compares Himax\u2019s valuation vs peers \u2013 note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers \u2013 with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables \u2013 representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\nThe average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 \u2013 representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\n  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA \u2013 which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!\nIs $54/share possible here? Absolutely \u2013 as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its\n existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\nWe haven\u2019t even discussed $HIMX\u2019s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\nBut I\u2019d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and \u201cin the game\u201d, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.\nYes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary \u2013 although, that is probably some time away.\nFor now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.\nLet\u2019s squeeze this one dry. GME X\u2019mas special.\n\n\n\n\nPositions: 2k shares 50 dec 17 $13c",

        "selftext": "**Intro**: When the $BSGA (Bitdeer) DA came out, there was little to no interest apart from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/qzo5x8/bsga_simple_uncomplicated_trade_potential/), which provided some simple rationale for why it could be a good asymmetric bet. Even then, most regulars on [r/SPACs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/) didn't like it given that it's a crypto SPAC, doesn't have an investor presentation (yet), and has no PIPE. This was also my initial reaction, but out of curiosity I looked into it...and then I looked into it a lot more, and I've come to the realization that the current lack of info/investor presentation is a blessing in disguise for those who are willing to do some more digging.\n\nWith the lack of an investor presentation, it's hard to tell what is Bitdeer's total hash rate or MW capacity. For those that are new to crypto miners, these are common metrics used to value these companies as it directly corresponds to how much Bitcoin it can mine per second. There is some margin difference based on the efficiency of a miner's operations, but I'd expect Bitdeer to have industry leading margins given its close ties with Bitmain and long-standing operational experience (more on this later).\n\n*Disclosure/Disclaimer: I own a large position in BSGA commons as it now represents my highest conviction pick. However, none of this is financial advice, and I encourage you to do your own due diligence.*\n\n**Overview of Bitdeer's Business**:\n\nBitdeer was formerly the mining division of Bitmain and was spun off as a separate company earlier this year, resolving a long power struggle between Jihan Wu and Bitmain\u2019s other co-founder, Micree Zhan. For those new to crypto mining, Bitmain is the dominant supplier of bitcoin mining equipment, and [estimated to supply 80% of the market](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-17/china-s-crypto-chips-king-sets-his-sights-on-ai) with customers like Core Scientific, Riot Blockchain, and Marathon Digital Holdings.\n\nBitdeer provides the opportunity to start mining crypto with a single click through its cloud service platform. This saves users from complicated processes, such as the procurement of mining equipment, the logistics of transport, power management, and the operation and maintenance of the mining farms. In addition, Bitdeer offers crypto mining construction, operation, procurement, and maintenance services to companies wanting to start large-scale mining operations.\n\nBitdeer has served users from over 200 countries and regions around the world with monthly traffic of over 3 million visitors. They have constructed over 30 mining datacenters and currently operate five of those datacenters for proprietary use (the remaining datacenters were constructed for partners/clients). Bitdeer offers support for mining over 10 cryptocurrencies and has plans to add more in the future.\n\n*Note: While the press releases/website doesn't talk about this, Bitdeer also most likely mines crypto for its own wallet holdings in addition to renting its crypto-mining capacity to users. This is similar to XPDI (Core Scientific) and RIOT.*\n\n**Research on Bitdeer's Total MW Capacity**:\n\nIn order to get a sense of the size and valuation of Bitdeer, the most straightforward approach would be to estimate how much MW capacity they have. A miner's total hash rate directly corresponds with the amount of power they have available, with potentially some slight differences depending on what generation of mining machines are being used. Starting with the crypto mining industry as a whole, we can see what the 2021E MW capacities look like for the majority of the publicly traded crypto miners on Slide 9 of [Riot's Nov 17, 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_87f293457a50abdc239c88c4caf1e5c3/riotblockchain/db/447/4154/pdf/Riot+Corporate+Presentation+Q3+2021.pdf).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqlq14l96q281.png?width=1383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55d3f0eb149713e0be0084731d5a7044ce8ae0c5\n\nThis is from RIOT's corporate deck, which doesn't have Bitdeer numbers yet\n\nAnd what is Bitdeer's total MW capacity? Jihan Wu, Bitdeer's founder and chairman, recently appeared on Anthony Pompliano's podcast and commented on this. Towards the end of the podcast, he talks about Bitdeer, and at [2:07:05](https://youtu.be/xRYPV8odfp8?t=7625) he discloses the following info: **\"Right now, we have around...1,000 MW in the United States and 400 MW in North Europe, and these numbers are going to double or triple in the next few years.\"** That would be a total of 1,400 MW! For reference, $XPDI (Core Scientific) is projecting 512 MW by the end of 2021 and is valued at $4.3B EV at a $10 share price, but is currently trading at $13.04, which already appears to be [undervalued in comparison to its peers](https://twitter.com/kingtutspacs/status/1445786805861642244). $BSGA (Bitdeer) is valued at $4B EV at a $10 share price and is currently trading at $10.24. Through this post, I'm trying to help [r/SPACs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/) be the first.\n\nThat being said, I want to take a more conservative approach and investigate if the 1,400MW that Bitdeer has right now refers to developed capacity or signed power agreements that have yet to be fully brought online.\n\nStarting with this [article](https://forkast.news/headlines/crypto-miner-bitdeer-blocks-china/), published on May 27, 2021, Bitdeer was said to operate \"a 50-megawatt crypto mining farm in Norway, to which it is adding a 300 MW farm currently under construction, and it runs a 200 MW farm in the U.S.\" So, at the time, that would be two farms with a total capacity of 250MW that were already online, with a third 300MW farm under construction in Norway.\n\nSince then, a [Houston news source recently reported that Bitdeer has a 700MW facility](https://www.khou.com/article/news/investigations/bitcoin-mining-power-grid-concerns/285-86f94599-6239-4518-be9f-a91b4f5f481f) in Rocksdale, TX. This would be a fourth crypto farm. The article doesn't specify whether the 700MW facility is already fully online or not, but the article does say that neighbor Riot is in the process of finishing a 700MW facility in the same town. To be safe, let's assume that Bitdeer's 700MW facility has also not been fully constructed yet. Looking at Riot's progress from [50 MW on April 30, 2021 (Slide 4)](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_87f293457a50abdc239c88c4caf1e5c3/riotblockchain/db/447/4128/pdf/RIOT+HCW+Deck+4-21-21+v4.pdf) to their latest 2021E projection of 350MW, we can estimate that they expect to have completed construction of 300 of the 700MW Rockdale facility by the end of 2021. From the timeline on their [homepage](https://www.riotblockchain.com/), that seems to be their only expansion since May, so we can infer that the entire jump from 50MW to 350MW is due to their Rockdale location.\n\nThus, taking Riot's Rocksdale progress as a proxy, we can infer that Bitdeer has added on another 300MW from their own Rockdale location on top of their 250MW total reported on May 27. Following the same MW rate of progress in Norway as in the USA, we can make an assumption that Bitdeer has also added 300 MW of capacity from their 300MW Norway farm that was reported to be under construction in May. Altogether, T=that would be four mining farms with a total of 850 MW.\n\nAnother data point that can help our estimate is that the [May article](https://forkast.news/headlines/crypto-miner-bitdeer-blocks-china/) reported that Bitdeer only had 2 farms under operation at that time. In the recent [BGSA/Bitdeer DA announcement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitdeer-a-world-leading-technology-company-for-the-cryptocurrency-mining-community-announces-plans-to-list-on-the-nasdaq-through-merger-with-blue-safari-group-acquisition-corp-301427759.html), they state that \"Bitdeer currently operates *five* proprietary mining datacenters in the United States and Norway.\" So far, our 850MW figure only accounts for four locations. If we assume that the fifth location adds 150 MW, which is relatively small compared to their other four locations, then that would make a total of 1,000MW.\n\nAs a rough check to see if 1,000-1,400MW is sensible, Core Scientific ($XPDI) has 150+ employees/512 MW and Bitdeer ($BSGA) has [300+ employees](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/09/08/2293670/0/en/Introducing-Bitdeer-Group-the-World-s-Premier-All-Inclusive-Digital-Asset-Mining-Service-Provider.html)/TBC MW. This suggests that Bitdeer is at least two times the size of Core Scientific, and more if we consider economies of scale.\n\n**In conclusion, we can estimate Bitdeer to have a total capacity size of 1,000-1,400MW. This would make Bitdeer the largest crypto miner in the world by a factor of 2-3X (Core Scientific would be the 2nd largest with 512MW).**\n\nOther notable references:\n\n[This recent article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/31/bitcoin-mining-giants-bitdeer-riot-blockchain-in-rockdale-texas.html) says: *\"the mayor (of Rocksdale), whose son landed a full-time job with Bitdeer this year, shared a bit about the operation. According to King, Bitdeer is \u201cexpanding as fast as it can be built...King has already fielded close to 40 inquiries from mining companies keen to set up shop there, many of whom are Chinese miners.\"* From this, we can confirm that Bitdeer has indeed been growing rapidly this year and even has a good relationship with the mayor of a town whose power capacity is so coveted by miners, which would bode well for their future expansion plans.\n\nSpeaking of their future expansion, in their [press release](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/09/23/2302519/0/en/Bitdeer-Group-Introduces-Industry-Leading-Mining-Datacenter-Boasting-Unmatched-Capacity-and-Energy-Efficiency.html), Bitdeer states that they expect to reach 3,000MW by the end of 2023. With our estimate of Bitdeer's total capacity to be 1,000MW-1,400MW, this fits with Jihan's statement that they will double or triple their capacity in the next few years (few typically refers to \\~3). For reference, Core Scientific is targeting 1,031MW by the end of 2022, which was already higher than any other miner's projections.\n\n**Implications for Bitdeer's Stock Price**:\n\nFrom the table below, we can see BSGA's fair value would put the stock price much much higher using a MW capacity estimate range of 1,000-1,400MW.\n\n$BSGA (Bitdeer)$XPDI$MARA$RIOT$HUT$HIVE$VCXA (Prime)Current Stock Price ($)$10.24$ 13.04$ 51.39$ 37.37$ 12.75$ 3.85$10.342021E Capacity (MW)1000-14005121053501448070Market Cap ($B)4.275.855.254.332.061.451.721Enterprise Value ($B)4.0965.7064.874.161.891.47$1.55Mkt Cap/MW ($M/MW)3.0511.4350.0012.3714.3118.1324.59\n\n*Note: one assumption I'm making is that BSGA (Bitdeer) and VCXA (Prime Blockchain) have the same amount of cash on its balance sheet as RIOT, so that I can more easily compare market caps/stock prices. None of the crypto miners have much or any cash on their balance sheet, so this assumption shouldn't change things much. For future reference, BTC's price was* \\~*$57K* *at the time of this post.*\n\nImplied $BSGA (Bitdeer) prices based on peers' Mkt Cap/MW multiples using a 1,000-1,400MW range:\n\nBased on $XPDI multiple: $27.43-$38.40\n\nBased on $MARA multiple: $120.02-$168.03 (will ignore and assume this is an outlier)\n\nBased on $RIOT multiple: $29.70-$41.57\n\nBased on $HUT multiple: $34.34-$48.07\n\nBased on $HIVE multiple: $43.51-$60.91\n\nBased on $VCXA multiple: $59.01-$82.62 (will ignore assume this is an outlier, rumored $1.5B valuation has not been confirmed yet)\n\nTaking the average multiples of XPDI, RIOT, HUT, and HIVE, this gives BSGA a trading price of $33.74-$47.24. However, it's currently at $10.24. Therefore, I think this is an outstanding opportunity to get in on what is appears to be by far the biggest crypto mining company in the world trading at a substantial discount compared to its peers.\n\nDespite all this, I'd understand if this seems too good to be true. I've personally asked myself various questions on why this isn't as good as it seems to be. Here's a list of those questions along with possible answers that I've come up with:\n\n**FAQ**\n\n**Q**: Isn't this a Chinese company and therefore, we should be concerned about this being a scam company?\n\n**A**: All of Bitdeer's mining operations are in the US/Norway. Their corporate headquarters is in Singapore. Bitdeer [serves users from over 200 countries around the world](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211022005210/en/Bitdeer-Announces-Availability-of-the-Highly-Demanded-Filecoin) and none of those countries are China. Ever since China banned crypto mining in May, Bitdeer has not offered any of its services to China customers and this is confirmed in its latest [terms of use](https://www.bitdeer.com/info/125). As a bonus (for the MVST crew), [Bitdeer's Linkedin job postings](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitdeer-group/jobs/) are all purely in English and are based in Singapore or California. So to recap, none of Bitdeer's operations, offices, or customers are in China. All this to me indicates that Bitdeer is not a Chinese company.\n\n**Q**: Wait, but wasn't this formerly part of Bitmain, which was a Chinese company?\n\n**A**: Bitdeer indeed was part of Bitmain and essentially acted as their Core Scientific/MARA arm. Jihan Wu is the Chairman of Bitdeer and was one of the co-founders of Bitmain. In Jan 2021, [Bitmain and Bitdeer split](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/01/26/bitmain-co-founder-exits-resolving-years-long-power-struggle-as-mining-firm-preps-ipo/), with one co-founder taking over Bitmain and the other (Jihan Wu) taking over Bitdeer. While Bitmain is located in China, it is one of the most reputable and well-known crypto companies in the world. The fact that Bitdoor was once part of Bitmain and still has them as a strategic partner, is actually a big plus for Bitdeer, given the limited supply of Bitmain miners. I'll expand on this connection more later, along with Jihan Wu's success in the industry.\n\n**Q**: Why does Bitdeer not have a PIPE? That means they couldn't attract investors, right?\n\n**A**: We actually have precedence for a notable crypto company going public through SPAC without a PIPE: XPDI (Core Scientific). In XPDI's [latest S4](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-334237/), it states that \"the parties determined at that time not to proceed with the potential PIPE due to various factors, including the advantageous position that the combined company would be in relative to many SPACs due to both Core Scientific and Blockcap being cash flow positive.\" Basically, XPDI didn't really need additional funding due to being cash flow positive, and I'm quite sure the same is true for Bitdeer. If they really wanted more money, they could have at least gone with a bigger SPAC, but their choice of a small SPAC supports my thesis that they didn't want/need the extra funding.\n\nI'll also note that one of Bitdeer's major VC investors is Sequoia Capital. Notable companies that Sequoia invested in early on include Apple, Google, Oracle, Youtube, Instagram, Zoom, WhatsApp, Linkedin, and Paypal. Sequoia's investment should give some added legitimacy to Bitdeer.\n\n**Q**: Won't BSGA have a minimum cash condition that they are unlikely to meet due to high redemptions?\n\n**A**: Firstly, so far, there have been 4\\*\\*.\\*\\*67M shares traded of BSGA since the DA announcement, and they have all been above NAV. With only 5.75M shares in the total float, that would indicate that redemptions probably won't be too high. But hypothetically if we assume that redemptions are very high, what would happen? We can't know for sure without an F4/S4 filing, but I suspect that they won't have a minimum cash condition. Again, this is taking cues from XPDI's [S4 filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-334237/), where they say \"because the combined company was expected to be cash flow positive, the parties also agreed to the elimination of a minimum cash condition in the merger agreement.\"\n\n**Q**: BSGA's cash trust is only $58M. Why would BSGA go with such a tiny SPAC?\n\n**A**: I have a suspicion on this: imagine you're a company that wants to go public but don't really need the funding. What's the easiest/fastest/most cost-efficient way to do this? Well, one approach would be to look at all the SPACs without target (there are currently 500+ SPACs without a rumor or target) and identify which of them provide the least amount of funding and dilution. A smaller trust means that even if there are a high number of redemptions, you're not giving much of your company away due to future warrant exercises. BSGA was one of only 5 SPACs with a cash trust of under $60M without any warrants (all 5 of these do have 1/10 rights per unit). This would allow Bitdeer to go public without incurring much dilution or cost (I believe underwriting expense is based upon the cash trust).\n\n**Q**: Why bother going public at all if you don't care about raising much funding?\n\n**A**: Again, same question could be asked for XPDI, but ultimately I think the answer is there are benefits to being a public company apart from raising capital. From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/advantages-disadvantages-company-going-public/), we can see a couple: \"increased public awareness of the company because IPOs often generate publicity by making their products known to a new group of potential customers\" and \"IPO also may be used by founding individuals as an exit strategy. Many venture capitalists have used IPOs to cash in on successful companies that they helped start-up.\" Note that regarding the 2nd point on VCs cashing out, SPACs cannot issue more shares while they are still a SPAC and even after merger, there is typically a 180+ day lock-up agreement for insiders.\n\n**Q**: Some people say cloud mining is a scam, is that true?\n\n**A**: Ultimately what matters for valuing Bitdeer is its MW capacity/hashrate. So, whether it really pays out to customers who use its cloud computing platform or keeps the HODL assets for itself is somewhat secondary. Still, we should not be investing in corrupt companies. From these two Youtube reviews ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxTaOaqD_y8&amp;list=WL&amp;index=127) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzh1u-Pk_VA&amp;list=WL&amp;index=126)), we can see that Bitdeer is not a scam. Note that the 2nd user does complain about poor customer service and outages in subsequent videos, but maintains that it's a legit service. The comments on this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/mh5ahn/does_anyone_use_bitdeercom/) also suggest that it's not a scam as well--users are indeed paid out their fair share. In the near future, I also plan to buy a mining plan on [Bitdeer.com](https://bitdeer.com/) and will report back with my results.\n\n**Q**: The valuation difference argument doesn't always work well for SPACs vs. non-SPACs. For example, $DCRC vs. $QS. Why should it work here?\n\n**A**: Firstly, we do have SPAC to SPAC crypto-miner comparisons that we can leverage in this case ($XPDI and $VCXA). Both of these valuations and stock prices indicate significant upside for $BSGA as I've shown in the tables above. Secondly, EV/Battery companies are more so valued based on hype and how much people think they will sell/succeed several years from now. Crypto miner valuations, on the other hand, are pretty easy to standardize through concrete metrics such as total hash rate and MW power as they directly correspond to how much Bitcoin/crypto and therefore, revenue, they can generate right now on a per-second basis.\n\n**Q**: This all still seems too good to be true. Why would Bitdeer take on such a low valuation in comparison to other miners?\n\n**A**: I don't know of course, but perhaps one reason is that the negotiations mainly took place when BTC was much lower than its current price. Another possibility is that Bitdeer is just looking for the path of least resistance for going public, and therefore doesn't want to deal with the threat of cash trust potentially being completely redeemed and going public. Coming back to an earlier point: if a company that doesn't really need capital were to accept a discounted valuation, it would make sense for them to pick a SPAC with the least amount of cash trust, minimal future dilution, and forgo a PIPE (and maybe not even bother with an investor presentation).\n\n**Further Intrinsic Reasons to Be Bullish on Bitdeer**:\n\nSorry, this is turning into a long post, but I have more to say! The above fair price calculation does not include other intrinsic characteristics of Bitdeer that arguably mean it should trade at a premium compared to its peers.\n\n* Bitdeer's founder and chairman is Jihan Wu. Jihan Wu is very well-known in the crypto space, having founded Bitmain (the dominant supplier of mining rigs) and Matrixport (crypto investment platform similar to Bullish, valued at +$1B). Jihan's name can bring publicity to Bitdeer and that would help get the SPAC merger some significant exposure.\n* Bitdeer was a part of Bitmain and still has Bitmain as a strategic partner. Given the [supply chain shortages around the world and specifically for miners](https://qz.com/2084036/even-bitcoin-is-getting-hit-by-the-supply-chain-crisis/), any mining company that can have prioritized access to new miner supplies have a distinct advantage. Considering Bitdeer/Bitmain's close connection, where formerly Bitdeer was not even a separate entity, Bitdeer should have an advantage in sourcing all-important asic miners at an attractive cost.\n* The above Bitdeer fair price calculation doesn't give any value to its other businesses besides owning crypto mines: they also build, maintain, and provide supplies for other crypto miners. To date, they have [constructed over 30 mining datacenters](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptocurrency-mining-company-bitdeer-gets-221056564.html), only 5 of which do they own. They also create and sell the [Antbox](https://www.bitdeer.com/news/jifkrjts), which is an efficient plug-and-play enclosure for combining 180 Antminer S19 units together. Additionally, they have a [marketplace](https://www.bitdeer.com/market) on their website that allows other crypto mining hosters to sell their capacity to customers. All of these businesses would add additional revenue streams unique to Bitdeer.\n* Bitdeer has been constructing crypto mines since 2013, making it possibly the longest operating large-scale crypto miner. For comparison, Core Scientific started in 2017 and RIOT in 2020. Bitdeer's early start date along with the expertise it has from being a part of Bitmain should indicate that its operational execution and efficiency is industry-leading. This, combined with the fact that they've been hired to build many other crypto mines for other companies and have various technological ([Antbox](https://www.bitdeer.com/news/jifkrjts), [MiningOS](https://www.bitdeer.com/news/6xp3vta0), [utilizing the latest miners](https://www.bitdeer.com/news/1515)) innovations also support the case for their operational efficnecy prowess.\n\n**Extrinsic Events That Could Serve as Catalysts for Bitdeer**:\n\n* At BTC's current price of $56K, BSGA already has quite a bit of upside as I've shared above. But what if Bitcoin goes above $70K, $80K...$100+K? I know many here, including me as I've commented multiple times, don't think crypto/BTC should be this high. Even I though, would buy some BTC if it drops down to $35K, which tells me it's more likely to make ATHs than go back down to that level. If BTC really takes off, all crypto miners will be red hot. For example, MARA went from $20 during the summer BTC's low of 30K to $80 with BTC's recent highs of $69K. The main reason for MARA's recent drop to the $50s isn't due to BTC but the fact that it [received an SEC subpoena related to one of its data centers](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/15/marathon-digital-receives-sec-subpoena-related-to-2020-hardin-data-center-agreement/) and [priced a $650M convertible note offering](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/15/2334891/0/en/Marathon-Digital-Holdings-Inc-Prices-Upsized-650-0-Million-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Offering.html). This suggests that BGSA has 4x upside simply due to BTC making another bullish run.\n* Bitdeer publishes an investor presentation or preliminary filing confirming my rough estimate of their mining capacity. From their Twitter account, Bitdeer [responded](https://twitter.com/jad_yassine/status/1462958250480087045) to someone's request for an investor presentation with \"we'll share more details when the time comes. Thanks for your suggestion \ud83d\ude0a.\" So, maybe they will publish an investor presentation at some point. At the very least, Bitdeer would have to publish the size of their operations and revenue projections in their preliminary filing. They are targeting to complete the merger in Q1 of 2022, so the prelim filing should come within the next 2 months. As I stated in my analysis, I think 650 MW is fairly conservative so their filing may show that their operations are even bigger.\n* No PIPE. No near-term dump of shares due to an S1 filing going effective. For the foreseeable futures, there will only be 5.75M shares available.\n* Low-float and possible future options. I don't really want to make a big deal of this as I feel it decreases the credibility of the invevstment, but Bitdeer's float is only 5.75M shares. If Twitter FURUs catch onto this, things could get pretty interesting. If BSGA were to also get options on top of all this, the possibility of a gamma squeeze without the impending doom of a PIPE dump would be in play.\n* Bitmain IPO. It looks like Bitmain is preparing to go public in late 2021 or early 2022 ([source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitmain-co-founder-exits-resolving-153722826.html), [source 2](https://www.investopedia.com/news/crypto-mining-giant-bitmain-going-public-4050-billion-valuation/)). Previously, Bitmain tried to go public in late 2018 with a market cap of $40-50B, but ultimately failed to as the crypto winter followed shortly after. Given that BTC's price is substantially higher now and crypto mania appears to be firmly intact, its valuation now may be even higher. Regardless, Bitmain's IPO would be very high-profile and bring attention to its former sister company, Bitdeer. This could do for Bitdeer what Rivian's IPO did for LCID/GGPI.\n* Arbs are likely soon to be out of BSGA. Since DA on Nov. 18, 4.67M of a total 5.75M shares BSGA have been traded, all above NAV. We can look at XPDI's [trading history](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/xpdi/historical) as a reference for what may happen when arb selling pressure subsides. XPDI started rising significantly exactly once the total traded volume exceeded the total amount of XPDI shares in trust. (On July 21, the XPDI DA was announced. On Oct 14, XPDI's total trading volume exceeded 34.5M shares, which is the total number of XPDI shares available. It then went from $10.30 on Oct 13 to an ATH of $15 on 11/22.)\n\n**TL;DR**:\n\nWith $BSGA (Bitdeer) still trading near NAV, it represents an incredible opportunity to buy what seems to be by far the largest crypto miner in the world with a valuation that implies \\~230-370% upside using the average Mkt Cap/MW multiples of its crypto mining peers (XPDI/RIOT/HUT/HIVE). As a bonus, out of all the crypto miners, Bitdeer has the longest history of crypto mining and has the closest ties to Bitmain, the world's dominant supplier of mining machines. Additionally, if BTC rises, all miners will rise, giving Bitdeer even more upside. Note that [NAV is $10.10](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-141833/), so even if Bitcoin were to go to $0, this shouldn't really go below $10.00 as arbs would step in for the guaranteed redemption return.",

This is a name that I have traded in the past and which I will continually trade in and out of.\nTo be clear, the Yield Fanatic does reserve to trade or invest in the name, subject to views and valuation at that specific point in time.\n   Finally and before we start, note that this was originally written up for the purpose of posting on Reddit, so the tone may seem different to the one normally adopted on my other pieces of work.\n $HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present. TLDR:\n 1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company \u2013 trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\n The shares are cheap in a more \u201cnormal\u201d S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\n 2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4\u201921 and even Q1\u201922, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have consistently delivered\n\n results \u201cto guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether.\n 4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year \u2013 representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\n 5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\n  ..and now for the fun bit:\n 6. Potential for a significant short squeeze. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were ~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to ~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\n The amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short \u2013 and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\n7. Cant confirm this (unconfirmed hearsay) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up..... and it has already shot up ~15% last couple of weeks.\n  Disclosure: I own stock + Jan\u201922 and Mar\u201922 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan\u201922 and $10 Mar\u201922).\n \n What does $HIMX do? Products?\n Before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question \u2013 here\u2019s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make \u2018panels\u2019 which are, in turn, used in:\n - Large sized DDICs -&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\n - Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs -&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\n   In addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\n- High end Timing Controller which improves power efficiency in displays\n   - WiseEye ultra power AI --&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ AI and ML to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet\n of Things (IoT) area.\n \n  - Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays \u2013 with usage in AR/VR glasses, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), Holographic Displays, etc.\n \n- Other products in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)\n  As a summary \u2013 the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:\n \nRevenue by segment:\nRevenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) \u2013 with Automotive OEM representing ~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs ~12.5%.\n  However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.\nThe Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.\n  \n Competitors and Market Shares:\nIn the Q3\u201921 presentation (available here), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).\nYou may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.\nAs for market share by the individual segments, as of Q3\u201921, $HIMX\u2019s market shares were:\n   - Large DDIC: 10.5%\n  - Smartphones: 10.4%\n - Tablets: 37.7% but note that $HIMX has &gt; 60% market share of Android / non iOS tablets \u2013 the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.\n   - Automotive OEM: 32.8%\n  So, what has been happening recently with Himax?\n2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.\nCompany realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific \u201cmature nodes\u201d for its products.\n \n $HIMX management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in \"mature nodes\u201d combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially.... and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\nCovid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX \u2013 not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX\n found itself in a very sweet spot.\nThis gamble paid off very very well \u2013 as demand spiked. When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players), $HIMX walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!\nThis allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\nSo what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) .....but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and Automotive/vehicles.\nIn addition, the modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV) would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\n   \n On top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5G and high performance computing (HPC) \u2013 would also require components that use the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d that its DDIC business used.\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage \u2013 which they started preparing for, some time ago.\nI guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.\nIsn\u2019t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 this is from a combination of\n  more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\nHowever, $HIMX was smart \u2013 it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand.... and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\nSo yes, for now \u2013 the demand will persist, and as management has said, this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX\u2019s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage.\nNow, that\u2019s the background. Supply secured along with said demand.\nSHORT SQUEEZE\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear Short Squeeze candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 \u2013 and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\nSo, why do I mention a \u2018SHORT SQUEEZE\u2019 \u2013 well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest\n  is around 24.7m shares, representing ~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting ~11 days to cover.\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of \u201cshort availability utilization\u201d. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201cGME X\u2019mas special\u201d.\n \n With earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.\n https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) \u2013 so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\n  \n As you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun\u201921 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed \u2013 this could rally much much higher than previous highs.\nI understand the short-thesis \u2013 I really do.\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices \u2013 could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\nThe whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance \u2013 but recent\nguidance seems to suggest otherwise.\nI can personally find NO REASON to be short this stock anymore at least for the next 7 months, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4\u201921 and decent outlook for Q1\u201922) and then we will have a dividend payment in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\nFrom what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay \u2013 much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\nBut now, its time for a reversal.\n   \n The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul\u201921).\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been ~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\nSo far, YTD Q3\u201921, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\n  An 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!\nThat, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July \u2013 so we have some time. But let\u2019s face it, everyone can do that math \u2013 and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. An earlier distribution is also likely \u2013 potentially through share buybacks.\nCompany has bought back shares previously \u2013 and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance \u2013 so I wouldn\u2019t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\nAll in all \u2013 there will be significant upward pressure on the price \u2013 and although the shares have already risen ~15% over the last few weeks, it\u2019s quite a surprise that the stock hasn\u2019t rallied much more.\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\nA question from the \u201cGrowth Bros\u201d: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?\nA common question \u2013 and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\n  But, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses \u2013 meaning it is capex light. So, 2 points worth noting:\n1. Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is \u2018reinvestment\u2019. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\n   2. Reasonably capex-light business: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\n  Also, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\n\n - R&amp;D \u2013 including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\n  - Capex - including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\n In other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their \u2018investment phase\u2019, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\nSo performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming \u2013 so, why hasn\u2019t\n  the share price gone up then?\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20\u2019s performance) as well.\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\n  Hedge Funds\u2019 share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 \u2013 when performance improved dramatically.\n \n Much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\nSo, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn\u2019t stock kept pace?\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\n   Although the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. More on valuation at the end.\nThe belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION! Folks believe that this stock is manipulated by Market Makers (MMs) who are often option sellers on $HIMX. Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed.\nWith performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it\u2019s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!\nQ3 Earnings\nNow \u2013 let\u2019s discuss the recent earnings\nQ3\u201921 revenue: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\nQ3\u201921 gross margin: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2\u201921 and vs 22.3% in Q3\u201920 (guidance was 50.5-52%) Q3\u201921 EBITDA: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q \u2013 the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here! Q3\u201921 Levered FCF of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\n  The charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\n \n Charts for annual performance incl LTM Sep\u201921 and YTD Sep\u201921 are shown below:\n So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.\n \n GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market\n Performance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\nWhy was the market waiting on guidance? Because indications were that:\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline) (c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\n Worries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure......or at least that\u2019s what the shorts were betting on.\nBefore I go into $HIMX\u2019s guidance, let\u2019s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) \u2013 which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\n+\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\n - Q4\u201921 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\n  - Q4\u201921 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\n This Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) \u2013 so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\nBut $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:\n - Q4 revenue would INCREASE by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\n  - Gross margin: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\n  - Q4 IFRS EPS (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs\n prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.195 \u2192 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\n  - Q4 non IFRS EPS (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\n Yes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!\nTo be fair, the margin decrease is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple math\u201d, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX\u2019s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 100%.\n \n However, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 90.9% -&gt; a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact.\nBut, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through. In other words \u2013 earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\nThis level of \u201csurprise\u201d is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\nMr. Lopez\u2019s question is below:\n The answer to this question was pretty much that\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 \u2013 FY19), and\n   b) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers \u2013 making the demand for its products more \u2018defensive\u2019.\n  Management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \u201cagain and\n again and again\u201d (yes, 3 again\u2019s specifically mentioned) \u2013 and notes that guidance this time is no different.\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX\u2019s historical guidance, you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings \u201cwithin guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1\u201917) \u2013 and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.\n \n So yes \u2013 as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this \u201cagain and again and again\u201d!!! Let\u2019s just say management is highly credible.\nTop line guidance by segment:\n- Large DDIC \u2013 to GROW by high single digit q-o-q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\n- Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC (overall) \u2013 GROW low teens q-o-q and &gt;50% yoy By sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\n   - Smartphones -&gt; GROW high teens q-o-q &amp; &gt;30% yoy\n - Tablet -&gt; flat q-o-q, and\n   - Automotive -&gt; GROW double-digit q-o-q and &gt;100% yoy. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX\u2019s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\n Interestingly within the Smartphone segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is \u201cundertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features\u201d.\nAlso, and more importantly \u201csuccessful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches\u201d. i.e. winning more market share.\nLots to like here.\nAutomotive is $HIMX\u2019s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share. Company notes that the \u201cincrease in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle\nis evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle\u201d.\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need\n to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\n \n As noted earlier, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC segment, which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application (industrial application, from what I gather) \u2013 which is on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures).\n In addition, $HIMX also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical...\u201dto name a few\u201d. Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.\n$HIMX also notes \u201cwithin just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company\u2019s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services\u201d. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year. This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future.\n \n VALUATION &amp; Conclusion\nThe chart below compares Himax\u2019s valuation vs peers \u2013 note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers \u2013 with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables \u2013 representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\nThe average fair value on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 \u2013 representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\n  As for transaction comps, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents 21x EV/EBITDA \u2013 which if applied to $HIMX, gives a FV of $54/share or +370% upside!\nIs $54/share possible here? Absolutely \u2013 as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its\n existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\nWe haven\u2019t even discussed $HIMX\u2019s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long- term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\nBut I\u2019d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and \u201cin the game\u201d, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.\nYes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary \u2013 although, that is probably some time away.\nFor now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.\nLet\u2019s squeeze this one dry. GME X\u2019mas special.\n\n\n\n\nPositions: 2k shares 50 dec 17 $13c",

        "selftext": "**Remitly**\n\nTicker: RELY\n\nI\u2019ve  been meaning to write this DD for a while, and with Remitly\u2019s  first  quarterly earnings meeting having just concluded and the ensuing  price  drop I believe right now is one of the best times for entry in  this  hidden gem. While I don\u2019t believe this is going to explode on some   large catalyst, I believe there\u2019s an opportunity here for a movement to   the $45-50 levels in the next few months. We're currently sitting at a  strong support around $30.\n\n**Who is Remitly?**\n\nRemitly  is a recently IPO\u2019d company that handles international  remittances.  Remittance refers to transfer of money by foreign migrants  to their  home countries. It consists of several channels such as banks,  money  transfer operators, mobile network operators, and others.  Remittance  has increased massively in recent years due to businesses  involved with  customers &amp; clients working overseas. The opportunity  here is  huge, there are over 280 million immigrants and the global  remittance  market exceeds $1.5T annually.\n\nMain  competitors include Western Union (WU) as well as MoneyGram  (MGI).  However 90% of Remitly\u2019s business is driven by digital methods,   compared to 20% at these dinosaurs. Remitly\u2019s users absolutely love the   product \u2013 their app on Google Play has 285,000 reviews with a 4.8/5   rating.\n\nRELY is currently trading  close to 40% off it\u2019s IPO highs. The only  news that has come out about  Remitly since the IPO has been the  announcement of a partnership with  Facebook on their NOVI wallet to  power cash pickup in Guatemala. I  consider this type of partnership  neutral/bullish but it seems to have  been taken negatively by the market  given all the negative sentiment  around Meta. I still do not believe  that this drop is in any way  warranted\u2026\n\nRemitly announced their Q3 2021 earnings on November 10 after market close.\n\n* Revenue totaled $121.2 million, compared to $71.8 million, up 69% (giggidy) year over year.\n* Net  loss was $13.0 million, compared to $2.4 million net loss. The   increase in Remitly\u2019s net loss was primarily due to the $6.9 million   non-cash donation of common stock in connection with their Pledge 1%   commitment, as well as incremental stock-based compensation expense.\n* Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $0.3 million, compared to $0.6 million.\n* Send volume increased to $5.2 billion, from $3.2 billion, up 61% year over year.\n* Active customers increased to 2.6 million, from 1.7 million, up 51% year over year.\n* Average revenue per active customer increased 12% year over year to $47.34.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n8khefhk11z71.png?width=2147&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa2d85435363c0c054f043e872cc06010a2c12a4\n\n**Analyst Coverage**\n\nAnalysts  have been generally quite bullish about the stock, with an  average  price target of $51, representing a \\~65% upside form the current  price  of $30.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Firm|PT|Rating|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Wolfe Research|$42|Outperform|\n|JMP Securities|$52|Market Outperform|\n|JP Morgan|$57|Overweight|\n|Goldman Sachs|$61|Buy|\n|Barclays|$48|Overweight|\n|Keybanc|$48|Overweight|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently  sitting down about $141k/50% on today's sharp move downward. Bought an  extra 300 contracts to bring my total position to 1000. Lots of time to  get back at it before expiry. I closed out about $100k of gains on this  on the last run from 32 &gt; 37\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0o16d9kl11z71.png?width=1364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9c4ba1be41060530c63dd937830358581669a1d",

        "selftext": "For the original post (with pictures included): [https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMX/comments/qoy7os/himx\\_a\\_potential\\_short\\_squeeze\\_play\\_gme\\_xmas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMX/comments/qoy7os/himx_a_potential_short_squeeze_play_gme_xmas/)\n\nCredit to: u/Yield_Fanatic for the DD &amp; post\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company \u2013 trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\n\nThe shares are cheap in a more \u201cnormal\u201d S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\n\n2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\n\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4\u201921 and even Q1\u201922, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results \u201cto guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\\*.\\*\n\n4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year \u2013 representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\n\n5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\n\n..and now for the fun bit:\n\n6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\n\nThe amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short \u2013 and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **\u201c*****GME X\u2019mas special*****\u201d.**\n\n7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up\u2026.. and it has already shot up \\~15% last couple of weeks.\n\nDisclosure: I own stock + Jan\u201922 and Mar\u201922 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan\u201922 and $10 Mar\u201922).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does $HIMX do? Products?**\n\nBefore we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question \u2013 here\u2019s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\n\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make \u2018panels\u2019 which are, in turn, used in:\n\n\\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\n\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\n\nIn addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\n\n\\- ***High end Timing Controller (TCON)*** which improves power efficiency in displays\n\n\\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.\n\n\\- ***Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays*** \u2013 with usage in ***AR/VR glasses***, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), ***Holographic Displays***, etc.\n\n\\- ***Other products*** in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)\n\nAs a summary \u2013 the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Revenue by segment:**\n\nRevenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) \u2013 with Automotive OEM representing \\~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \\~12.5%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***\n\nThe Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Competitors and Market Shares:**\n\nIn the Q3\u201921 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).\n\nYou may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3\u201921, $HIMX\u2019s market shares were:\n\n\\- Large DDIC: 10.5%\n\n\\- Smartphones: 10.4%\n\n\\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets \u2013 the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.\n\n\\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***\n\n**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**\n\n2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.\n\nCompany realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific \u201cmature nodes\u201d for its products.\n\n$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in \"mature nodes\u201d combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\n\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially\u2026. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\n\n***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** \u2013 not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.\n\nThis gamble paid off very very well \u2013 as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***\n\nThis allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**\n\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) \u2026..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.\n\nIn addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\n\nOn top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** \u2013 would also require components that use the same \u201cmature nodes\u201d that its DDIC business used.\n\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage \u2013 which they started preparing for, some time ago.\n\n***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***\n\n**Isn\u2019t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 \u2013 this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\n\nHowever, $HIMX was smart \u2013 it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand\u2026. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\n\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo yes, for now \u2013 the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX\u2019s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\\*.\\*\n\nNow, that\u2019s the background\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHORT SQUEEZE**\n\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 \u2013 and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the \u201c***GME X\u2019mas special***\u201d.\n\nSo, why do I mention a \u2018***SHORT SQUEEZE***\\*\\*\u2019\\*\\* \u2013 well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\~11 days to cover.\n\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\n\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of \u201cshort availability utilization\u201d. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a \u201c***GME X\u2019mas special***\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) \u2013 so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\n\nAs you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun\u201921 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\n\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed \u2013 this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***\n\nI understand the short-thesis \u2013 I really do.\n\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices \u2013 could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\n\n***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance \u2013 but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***\n\nI can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4\u201921 and decent outlook for Q1\u201922) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\n\n***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay \u2013 much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***\n\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\n\n***But now, its time for a reversal.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**\n\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS as a dividend (paid in Jul\u201921).\n\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\n\nSo far, YTD Q3\u201921, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\n\nAn 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***\n\n***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***\n\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July \u2013 so we have some time. But let\u2019s face it, everyone can do that math \u2013 and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\n\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely \u2013 potentially through share buybacks.***\n\nCompany has bought back shares previously \u2013 and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance \u2013 so I wouldn\u2019t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\n\nAll in all \u2013 there will be significant upward pressure on the price \u2013 and although the shares have already risen \\~15% over the last few weeks, it\u2019s quite a surprise that the stock hasn\u2019t rallied much more.\n\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\n\n**A question from the \u201cGrowth Bros\u201d: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**\n\nA common question \u2013 and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\n\nBut, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses \u2013 meaning it is capex light.\n\nSo, 2 points worth noting:\n\n1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is \u2018reinvestment***\\*\\*\u2019\\*\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\n2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\n\nAlso, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\n\n\\- ***R&amp;D*** \u2013 including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\n\n\\- ***Capex*** \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\n\nIn other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their \u2018investment phase\u2019, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\n\n**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming \u2013 so, why hasn\u2019t the share price gone up then?**\n\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\n\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20\u2019s performance) as well.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\n\nHedge Funds\u2019 share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 \u2013 when performance improved dramatically.\n\nMuch of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***\n\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\n\n**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn\u2019t stock kept pace?**\n\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\n\nAlthough the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it\u2019s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**\n\n**Q3 Earnings**\n\nNow \u2013 let\u2019s discuss the recent earnings\n\n***Q3\u201921 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\n\n***Q3\u201921 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2\u201921 and vs 22.3% in Q3\u201920 (guidance was 50.5-52%)\n\n**Q3\u201921 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q \u2013 the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!\n\n***Q3\u201921 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\n\nThe charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\n\nCharts for annual performance incl LTM Sep\u201921 and YTD Sep\u201921 are shown below:\n\n***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**\n\nPerformance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\n\n***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:\n\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\n\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)\n\n(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\n\nWorries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure\u2026\u2026or at least that\u2019s what the shorts were betting on.\n\nBefore I go into $HIMX\u2019s guidance, let\u2019s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) \u2013 which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\n\n\\+\n\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\n\n\\- Q4\u201921 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\n\n\\- Q4\u201921 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\n\nThis Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) \u2013 so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***\n\n\\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\n\n\\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\n\n\\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\n\n\\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4\u201920) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\n\nYes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***\n\nTo be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to its customers anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple math\u201d, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX\u2019s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 50%.\n\nHowever, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 47.6% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\\*.\\*\n\n***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words \u2013 earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\n\nThis level of \u201csurprise\u201d is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s question is below:\n\nThe answer to this question was pretty much that\n\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 \u2013 FY19*), and\n\nb) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers \u2013 making the demand for its products more \u2018defensive\u2019.\n\nManagement also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance \u201c***again and again and again***\u201d (yes, 3 again\u2019s specifically mentioned) \u2013 and notes that guidance this time is no different.\n\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX\u2019s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings \u201cwithin guidance\u201d for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1\u201917) \u2013 and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***\n\nSo yes \u2013 as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this \u201cagain and again and again\u201d!!! Let\u2019s just say ***management is highly credible.***\n\n**Top line guidance by segment:**\n\n\\- ***Large DDIC*** \u2013 to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\n\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) \u2013 ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***\n\nBy sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\n\n\\- ***Smartphones*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***\n\n\\- ***Tablet*** \\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and\n\n\\- ***Automotive*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX\u2019s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\n\nInterestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is \u201cundertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features\u201d.\n\nAlso, and more importantly ***\u201csuccessful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches\u201d. i.e. ***winning more market share.***\n\n***Lots to like here.***\n\n***Automotive*** is $HIMX\u2019s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.\n\nCompany notes that the \u201cincrease in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle\u201d.\n\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\n\nAs noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\\*,\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***\n\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) \u2013 which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*\n\nIn addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical\u2026\u201dto name a few\u201d. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***\n\n$HIMX also notes \u201cwithin just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company\u2019s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***\u201d. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***\n\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.\n\n***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\\*.\\*\n\n**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**\n\nThe chart below compares Himax\u2019s valuation vs peers \u2013 note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\n\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers \u2013 with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables \u2013 representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\n\nThe ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 \u2013 representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\n\nAs for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** \u2013 which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\\*!\\*\n\n***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely \u2013 as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\n\nWe haven\u2019t even discussed $HIMX\u2019s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\n\n***But I\u2019d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and \u201cin the game\u201d, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***\n\n***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** \u2013 although, that is probably some time away.",
