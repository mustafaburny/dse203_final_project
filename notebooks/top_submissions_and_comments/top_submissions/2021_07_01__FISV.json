From 104$ to 92$.\n\nAirbus. The defense and aeronautical European giant was climbing slowly but firmly to regain their 139\u20ac pre-pandemic and today they are down 6%. The stock is at  104\n\nFiserv. The financial and technological company was climbing since pandemic. It reached 127 three months ago. Bad results and not filling the expectations made the stock go down since then. Today is down 4% at  106$. And I had this company on my radar before pandemic with a 150$ goal in one year\n\nWhich stocks do you see as a bargain today??",
