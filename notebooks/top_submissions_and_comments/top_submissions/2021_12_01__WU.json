        "selftext": "Does anyone else think Western Unions sell off is an over reaction? WU seems extremely undervalued. I believe it should be trading 30%+ higher than current price. \n\nWestern union dividend yield is over 5% and trades at a historically low PE and PFCF. \n\nWhile there\u2019s 0 revenue growth they are a cash flow machine and buy back an insane amount of shares. They have $500M left in buy back before YE if they choose to use. This is approx. 8% of the company. Many are scared they are a dying company but I do not think so. They just agreed to sell off a small part of their business for $900M cash. That\u2019s a lot of cash for western to give back to share holders. Also, I think concerns from fin tech is overrated. WU has been able to hold revenue steady for 10 years. If they continue buying back large portions of the company and holding revenue flat they will be fine. \n\nI\u2019m long WU until they recover back to mid $20s~. I don\u2019t want to hold them long term as they aren\u2019t a high enough growth company but they are undervalued at current prices.",

        "selftext": "Western union has had a sharp sell out recently. Call options are dirty cheap. Priced as if they are going out of business tomorrow. News is they aren\u2019t going out of business due to fintech anytime soon. They will bounce back to $24+ by May. I\u2019m buying as many May 2022 call options I can. They are growing earnings (not revenue) but are buying tons of shares back and sold off 7% of their company for $910M. When they go back to $24 you\u2019re looking at a 7X return on your calls come May. Easy money.",
