Stock has been largely ignored / under the radar during recent spike in marijuana stocks\n2. It\u2019s been trading down for the year and relatively flat around $0.13 \n3.  They are a real company operating across 6 states where marijuana is legal. Over 40 employees and expected revenue of $50M 2021\n4. 25% YoY growth \n5. CEO said they don\u2019t need to raise any external capital to fund current projections \n6. They do have over 1B outstanding shares, but completing a 30:1 reverse stock split soon to adjust\n7. Latest quarterly filings show they are both profitable ($1.5M net income Q3) and increasing cash position (+$1.1M net change), both signs for growth and sustainability\n8. One note on balance sheet is ~$17M liability called \u201cloans from members\u201d which causes a negative equity position, however, this is related to the merger and note 11 states it will be converted to equity upon maturity which was Jan 31, 2021. \n\nEdit: They announced 1 hour ago that their Pet CBD Brand, Mary\u2019s Tails will now be in 1,000 PetSmart stores: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iiroc-trading-halt-gsgs-p-145600185.html\n\nArizona Iced Tea deal:\n\nMost intriguing to me is the Arizona Iced Tea deal:\n\nThey announced a deal with Arizona Iced Tea in 2018 to make a line of marijuana infused drinks\n\n* Entered into a definitive agreement in 2019 to launch a line in 2020, but pandemic likely delayed this\n* Expect announcement regarding the launch of this product line in 2021\n* Email from investor relations confirms this deal is in place with announcement in the near term \n\nExisting brand loyalty and recognition:\n\nCurrent followers numbers on brand social media\n\nDixie brands:\nIG: 13.1K\nTwitter: 17.3K\n\nMary\u2019s Medicinal:\nIG: 27K\nTwitter: 100\n\nMary\u2019s Nutritionals:\nIG: 10.6K \n\nDefonce chocolate:\nIG: 7,800\nTwitter: 550\n\nRebel Coast Winery\nIG: 31.5K\nTwitter: 8,800\n\nSources\ntheir financial filings, \n\nthis press release https://dixieelixirs.com/press-release-new/?id=122555 \n\ntheir official social media accounts \n\nand these articles about the Arizona iced tea deal: https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/arizona-iced-tea-maker-turns-to-weed-11565172124 https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/dixie-brands-and-herbal-enterprises-sign-definitive-agreement-832663405.html \n\nAnd also an email I sent and received back from their investor relations about the Arizona Iced Tea deal but I couldn\u2019t attach a screen shot.. here\u2019s their response:\n\n\u201cThe deal is still in place and progress is being made to finalize all the details. We look forward to providing an update on this initiative in the near term.\u201d",
