        "selftext": "**Transition from hardware to software**\n\nBlackberry has transitioned from a hardware cellphone maker to a software developer focused on cyber security.\n\nBenefits of this include transitioning away from a highly saturated market dominated by big players such as Samsung, Apple and Huawei. This has increased gross margins to 76% up 29 points from 2016. \n\nThis move has also expanded Blackberry\u2019s reach in terms of different industries as they provide cybersecurity for average consumers, automakers (particularly in the ev and autonomous vehicle sectors), governments (used by 18 of the G20 countries) and banking/finance (used by the top 9/10 banks in the world.\n\nAnother positive of this move is that it has put Blackberry into a fast growing industry in cybersecurity. Since the beginning of Covid 19, the transition to online work has quickened. With this cyber crime has also sped up. As well with technology being integrated into every part of our lives such as smart homes and cars the need for strong cybersecurity has been on the rise. According to Forbes the industry is currently worth $173b and is expected to rise to $270b by 2026.\n\n**Blackberry Services**\n\nCylance\n\nCylance is the average consumer product. It is an antivirus that detects malware and ransomware. It uses a subscription based model. The technology is very good and easy to use although lacks some features found in competitors such as Norton or McAfee. Overall the product needs some improvement but is still very good.\n\nBlackberry QNX\n\nBlackberry QNX is the auto protection product. It is currently used in 175 million cars. They have recently announced partnerships with AWS and Baidu to expand this product. The Baidu partnership should open Blackberry up to the large and fast growing Chinese EV market. Another positive about this product is that regulation around the security of cars is increasing as more technology is incorporated into the vehicles. As the global EV market increases so should QNX.\n\nOther Products\n\nBlackberry makes a ton of other products such as IVY, UEM, SPARK among many others. \n\n**Financial Information (USD)**\n\nRevenue: Blackberry lost $150 million in 2020. Comes to $0.32 a share.\n\nAssets: Blackberry owns over 38000 patents. They also have $3.888 billion worth of assets.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe that Blackberry is a buy in the long run. They are in a fast growing industry and have some of the best software in the industry.\n\n**My Position**\n\nI currently own 45 shares @ $15.33 CAD\n\nI am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.",

What sets this company apart is their approach to quality product, which can be sold for higher prices.\n\n**Company overview**\n\nGGTTF is in the process of building out top tier cultivation assets, which when complete, will supply upwards of 10,000 kg of ultra-premium flower annually. High-end market will be undersupplied both in the short and long term, and companies who can consistently deliver quality product, such as GGTTF, will command sustained pricing power and strong demand.

        "selftext": "Hey gang, its **Boom** here, with a continuation of a series of DD posts for companies where I currently hold no position. No position = objective outlook. \n\nOSG \u2013 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc (as requested by u/green_mailer) \n\nOSG engages in the provision of energy transportation service for crude oil and petroleum products in the US flag markets. It operates Articulated Tug Barges (ATB), lightering ATBs, shuttle tankers, Medium Range (MR) tankers, and non-[Jones Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jonesact.asp) MR tankers that participate in the maritime security program. Relative to other penny stocks, this is an old company (founded 1948) that's only been listed on NASDAQ since late 2015. They primarily ship oil, and with a fleet of 110 vessels, they ship a lot of oil. Unlike a lot of other penny stocks, I couldn't find much information about share dilution or offerings, but taking a [closer look at the financials](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/osg/financials) gave me a bit of a pause. Let's get into it. \n\nOn a positive note, institutional ownership is pretty high, at a robust [60.39% according to Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/osg). Usually a good sign. I say *usually* because it's not always the case, and I think that holds true with OSG, because as of Q4 2020, [put options outweigh call options at a 2.73 ratio](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/osg), according to Whale Wisdom. I find the especially interesting in contrast with the insider transactions, which has seen 40 open market buys over the last 12 months with a net total of 3.6M shares being scooped up by insiders, primarily 16% owner Saltchuck and OSG President and CEO Samuel Norton.   \n\nScouring the news releases for OSG over the last few years, I didn't find anything about share dilution or offerings, as mentioned above. With the exception of the offerings, OSG seems to fall into the [same pattern as CTRM](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robinhoodpennystocks2/comments/m3a2fx/no_position_dd_ctrm_a_reddit_favorite_that_just/), buy boats and put them to work. However moreso than CTRM, OSG is in MASSIVE DEBT. Their debt to equity ratio of 108% is bad. [They have long term liabilities around $675M.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-osg/overseas-shipholding-group#past) Their liabilities total [more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-osg/overseas-shipholding-group/news/heres-why-overseas-shipholding-group-nyseosg-is-weighed-down-by-its-debt-load). This is a company with a market cap of $225M that, if their creditors came calling, they wouldn't be able to pay (neither would I if mine came calling, to be fair). That's where Saltchuck comes in. \n\nSaltchuck is a massive private holding company with interest in freight service, real estate management, and of course, petroleum distribution. Saltchuck boasts $2.6B in revenue and is [ranked at #170 on Forbes America's Largest Private Companies list of 2020](https://www.forbes.com/largest-private-companies/list/4/#tab:rank), right below Red Lobster (side note: I just make some [homemade cheddar bay biscuits](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-cheddar-biscuits/) from scratch, to die for). Saltchuck buys companies. And they've been increasing their position in OSG to where they now own 16% of the company. Positioning themselves as a massively influential shareholder could, in theory, help them shape the board, and in the long run lead the push for OSG to be acquired by Saltchuck. This might be the best way forward for OSG to help them with their debt. \n\nAs far as trading OSG, the company has little volume, which is why I think we see such wild price swings. If you like technicals, it *is* trading above it's 20, 50, and 200-day SMA. Almost all of [TradingView's technical indicators ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-OSG/technicals/)are saying \u201cbuy\u201d, but I'm still learning technicals myself, so I couldn't really tell you what that means.   \n\nNo position, no siree.\n\nLove ya\n\n \\- Boom\n\n\\*no position DD\\* archive\n\n[ITP](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m5meqz/no_position_dd_itp_alexa_play_the_office_theme/) [CTRM](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robinhoodpennystocks2/comments/m3a2fx/no_position_dd_ctrm_a_reddit_favorite_that_just/) [TMDI](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m3y611/no_position_dd_tmdi_a_dr_octopus_origin_story/) [SENS](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m3mg6n/no_position_dd_sens_cyberpunk_sugar77/) [EGY](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m3jnba/no_position_dd_egy_id_make_a_great_oil_baron/) [DARE](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m2yga4/no_position_dd_dare_a_different_kind_of_stimulus/) [AESE](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m2u95q/no_position_dd_aese_esports_poker_and_mega_deal/) [CSCW](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m2rlv9/cscw_social_media_film_magnate_ai_a_lot_for_a/) [NDRA](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m22gmu/ndra_medtech_with_a_big_boy_behind_it/) [ISR](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m1p5au/isoray_inc_cancer_zapper_medtech_dancer/) [MOTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m1awxn/mots_bet_your_butt_on_it/)",

        "selftext": "As promised in the discussion thread I would post some updated info on what Friday could bring in terms of ITM options. \n\n**TL;DR** the number of possible contracts ITM could be DOUBLE last weeks expiry. Over 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding to the ever increasing snowball.\n\n**Here is what I did:** Pulled the option chain data into excel, ran some numbers on open interest and found some crazy info. \n\n**What is a gamma squeeze:** For those who don't know what a gamma squeeze is but have heard it thrown around let me give a brief ELi5. Gamma squeezes revolve around options, I wont go into too much detail here on what those are, but basically you purchase a contract which gives you the option to buy the stock at a set price on a future date regardless of what that stocks current price is. Contracts are typically in lots of 100 shares per. Option contacts are not usually sold by individuals but rather market makers, biggest of whom being option houses out of Chicago. They have a complex price model which values contracts at set prices for said contract based on probability of them becoming ITM (in the money) of course, the higher the stock price for the contract the lower the cost because the odds of that happening is low. These market makers thought GME was garbage and sold way more contracts than they could feasibly handle because what are the odds GME @ $15 goes to $150... Market makers selling these contracts need to buy shares to hedge, which of course will cause that price to rise more and more.\n\n**Now that GME is @ $130:** Today was a great day, GME closed up $8.17 or 6.58% maybe not the crazy gains some hoped for, but on a down market day is pretty incredible. Now a rise in only $8 may not seem like it has much of an impact on gamma squeeze potential but just wait.. \n\n# GME Options Exp. 2021-03-05 (This Friday)\n\n**GME @ $100 (Last Fridays Close, Option Expiry):** At this level going into Friday we could expect **22,427** in open interest in ITM GME contracts this week. That sure is a lot of possible stocks that need to be purchased if those contracts are exercised. About **2,242,700** to be exact or about **4.97%** of the TOTAL FLOAT. Crazy. \n\n**GME @ $130:** We can expect **35,989** contracts to be ITM if tomorrow closes above $130. A solid **13,562** more contracts than at the $100 level. This equates to **3,598,900** shares or **7.97%** of total float. Now we're getting nutty.\n\n**What about GME @ $150:** Closing Friday above this level brings thousands more contracts ITM. In fact, closing above this price means there would be **46,397** contracts ITM. This means that a whopping **4,639,700** shares or **10.27%** of total float. **MORE THAN DOUBLE @ $100**\n\n**What does this mean?** Well not every contract will be exercised, even ITM. These market makers have also likely been finding shares to hedge for some time now as well. But its entirely impossible to ignore that if every contract were to be exercised, **10%** of all the shares in circulation would be needed and if anyone knows anything about supply and demand, it means more contracts will come ITM next week, and then more again the week after and so on. With the steady price rise we've been seeing, it could be these market makers are slowly buying up shares to hedge, COULD is operative and this is entirely speculation. What we do know is that MASSIVE amounts of money have been changing hands over this past week in GME. There's been crazy volume at times, particularly today, the day before contract expiry. Any how, ill put away my tinfoil hat. What we could be witnessing is the beginning of the beginning, the first domino's. \n\nDoes this information guarantee the stock takes off to the moon and beyond? No not really, but it sure does increase the odds of that happening. We probably cannot even fathom how these market behemoths are willing to protect themselves. We all saw what happened with RH, and whats crazy is its possibly the tip of the iceberg for actions they took, its just the action that we were able to see. \n\n**Summary:** Since last Friday (2021-02-26, last option expiry) the number of contracts possibly ITM has **DOUBLED** I repeat **DOUBLED.** If tomorrow closes above $150 and every contract is exercised **10%** of total float will be called on. Even if nothing happens tomorrow and we close @ $130 there is still **50%** more contracts ITM than last week. All of this continues to build that snowball that's started to get mighty big. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIll say it again for those in the back ***DOUBLED*****.**\n\nMic drop. \n\nNot financial advice, this is just for fun.\n\nAny questions feel free to ask away!",

You could say... I LIKE the mod team.*\n\nWhy did we not get transparency about how g\u00e6mstonk megathreads were going to be handled, ahead of time?\n\nFirst, the thread wasn't made.\n\nThen the threads made by users were being manually deleted.\n\nThen we got a comment stickied to the top of the daily thread saying words to the effect of \"no more g\u00e6mstonk daily threads, more news later.\"\n\nThat comment got deleted.\n\nThen we're told \"it's because interest in g\u00e6mstonk has died down\" (???????? Do you people LOOK at your own subreddit?)\n\nThen RKT gets a sticky. It gets MASS brigaded by the rightly fucked off g\u00e6mstonk pushers.\n\nThen we get told that the mods simply \"forgot\" to make the g\u00e6mstonk thread.\n\nThen finally, it was because Opinion forgot to set an alarm.\n\n...\n\nWhat. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On?\n\nYou don't want people to believe in conspiracies? Act homogeneously and transparently.\n\nI haven't seen ANY good DD on g\u00e6mstonk for DAYS even though there is TONS of important movement going on with it. Somehow RKT is the ONLY majorly mentioned DD ticker on Monday? Somehow *that alone justifies a sticky?*\n\nThat precedent is extremely dangerous. I hope you have highly competent tools that protect against vote manipulation and spam... because if all it takes is a single highly rated post and ticker the day before to earn a sticky the following day... you leave the entire subreddit vulnerable.\n\nAs a side note... Everyone believes 3/19 is the MOASS date... BUT OPEN INTEREST IN g\u00e6mstonk IS HIGHER THIS FRIDAY. THIS. FRIDAY.\n\nI am extremely bullish on GME and in my opinion this is the second best time to buy. It can't only go up. But if momentum is there... it can. I doubt MM's have delta'd for 200. 250. 300. 350... for this Friday, because right now it's limping at 115. And there are 24,000 calls at 800 for Friday. That is just ASTRONOMICAL.\n\nMovement is best THIS WEEK.\n\nNobody knows it... because all the front page g\u00e6mstonk text posts are just straight dumpster garbage. Zero information. All fluff. And people wonder why they think it's a dead play, a dumb play. \n\nI don't want to believe asinine theories like top-down manipulation. So some clarity on this is going to deeply alleviate that poisonous sentiment.\n\nEdit: there is a mod reply, please don't downvote it.\n\nEdit 2: this is a really good time to remind retail that... we are a significant force. Decoherent, stupid, self destructive... but sometimes even a room full of monkeys all throw their shit in the same direction. So just be more conscious of what that direction is.\n\nEdit 4: I censored the ticker to avoid spam from bots. Guess it worked. Had hardly any (like one?) Emoji/stupid comment.",

Do you like people? Look for a sales job and work your way up. Do you like traveling? Try and save some money, move to Latin America (edit: or somewhere else abroad) and teach kids English while living in a much more affordable tropical place. Feeling isolated?

No one should suffer alone.\n\nEdit: so happy to see so much love on this post. Thank you all for the awards. \n\nAlso, I am not trying to offer a one size fits all solution to depression/anxiety. I was in a very dark place after my sister died and was dealing with a bunch of external pressures that exacerbated my anxiety/depression. I am just trying to give EXAMPLES of questions one COULD ask themselves if they are feeling stuck, from my perspective. \n\nI may be overly optimistic, but I believe the universe has a place for each of us and no harm can come from continuing to hope for a better tomorrow. Peace and love my brothers and sisters.\n\nSecond edit:\nThis post goes out to all people suffering from anxiety/depression and/or suicidal thoughts and is not just limited to those who are active in the stock market. Love you all\n\nThird edit:\nI love you all so much. \n\nThis edit is for the person who made the following account (u/Many_Technician_4065) and messaged me. I was responding to your message and just as I clicked it, it said you had deleted your account. Your words spoke to me so deeply and I wanted to post my response here in the hopes that you might see it. I hope you do: \n\nI just want to say you are a beautiful writer and what you said really resonated with me. \u201cIf I want to kill myself for some reason that is at its core superficial, maybe I should live for an equally superficial reason just to see what happens. Maybe the prospect that I can do what I know I\u2019m capable of.\u201d That is a very similar sentiment to absurdism by Albert Camus and honestly is a lens through which I see the world. \n\nThe chances of us being born, exisiting on this strange rock suspended in a sun beam, were so infinitely small yet here we are. Yes, there may not be any objective purpose but here we are and that\u2019s pretty fucking special. I know you said I don\u2019t care about you, but I promise you I do. I care that you took the time to message me and share the beautiful inner workings of your Mind with me. I care that you and I are both 2% genetically different than chimps, evolved from bacteria in the ocean yet here we are, helping each other out and connecting. I really do care, and I appreciate your existence so much.",

        "selftext": "I have no idea how to write one of these, I just like the stock, and I don't want you Apes to miss out on this. Also i've been suffering with this bad boy as it has been oversold and shorted for the past month. Yes $RKT is absolutely mooning right now. Did you miss the RKT Rocket? Don't FOMO on the way back down to earth. Great news, theres another one on the tarmac ready for liftoff. It's name is $UWMC. $UWMC got a little bit of traction a month or so ago leading up to its earnings report after a massive SPAC deal. Guess what? It absolutely crushed its earnings. UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively.  This company is just getting started and has massive opportunity for growth. It was trading around $11 and got as high as $12 leading up to the earnings report? What happened after they released news that they absolutely crushed it? The stock plummeted, and it kept plummeting. It had maybe 4 green days out of 30 in the month after its earnings report. Why? Shorts. Who do we hate? The shorts! \n\nAdditionally, its a great income stock! UWMC declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021. Do you like free money? Load up on this bad boy prior to March 10th! \n\nThere are plenty of other catalysts and reasons to long this. It is getting added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 index by the end of this month, and it will absolutely crush its earnings again this quarter. Tomorrow, contracts will be pretty expensive as IV will go thru the roof in the AM, but as of market close there were still very reasonable prices for March, April, and May (post earnings) calls.  \n\nLook at this activity aftermarket, it is up $1.30 (\\~15%)! Do you wanna be staring from the sidelines as this stock rockets like $RKT? \n\n\\*Disclaimer\\* I am Long UWMC and have calls for both April and May.  This is not financial advice I just like the stock!!",

        "selftext": "The reason palantir was down recently was due to lockup expiration, which happened on Feb 18.\n\nEarly investors and employees that hold their shares for over a decade was able to sell portion of their shares to buy their new shiny car, house, and/or other reasons, had already done so. This create a very healthy pullback.\n\nNow is your chance to pick up the best long term AI and data analytic company with the biggest moat in tech.\n\nConsider these factors:\n\n\\-High Growth in the hottest AI and data analytic industry with a lot of IP.\n\n\\-Very low debt with $2 billion hand in hand.\n\n\\-Very high Gross Margin and Operating margin that keep going up as revenue increase at the same time, means that are really well run and they'll be very profitable in the future. They would have made a profit of $170million from the last 2 quarters if it wasn't for stock-based compensations.\n\n\\-Sticky customers that include governments and big expertises.\n\n\\-Limitless use case across almost any industry. Help BP become greener. Aid in cancer research. Help prevent wildfire in california. Help distribute the vaccine for covid-19. Help prevent future pandemic and disasters. Basically limitless use cases that help any corporation or government run large amount of data to discover the truth behind their data.\n\n\\-Palantir create disruptive future software that is ready for prime time and only recently started to get adopted by large corporation.\n\n\\-Great leadership\n\n\\-Cream of the crop employees. Beat out all of the FANNG companies.\n\n\\-No real competitors. Huge moat. One of the co-founder is Peter Thiel, also a co-founder of Paypal, and the author of \"Zero to One\". Where his philosophy is  always \"aim for monopoly, competition is for losers \".\n\n\\-Very forward looking. They create technology not for the past, but for the future need. Karp, their CEO said their goal is to become the world most \"important software company\" in the future.\n\n\\- They are able to create test simulation on your whole companies to see how different components affect your overall business from top to bottom and see how one change can affect the entire organization.\n\n\\-Create massive value for their clients by saving cost and becoming more efficient.\n\n\\-Allow any employees from your organization to make meaningful contribution without hiring costly data scientist that only perform ad-hoc task.\n\n\\-SaaS with apollo. Apollo allow SasS to be in almost anything like a submarine, with little or unstable internet connection, harsh environments, humvees, and etc. Before Apollo everything is frozen in time with old and unsecured legacy preinstalled software.\n\n\\- Interactive and easy to use user interface that is customizable to whatever you want.\n\n\\-Can be integrated with private cloud, AWS, google cloud, hybrid cloud, etc.\n\n\\-Highest level security trusted by the government.\n\n\\-They can now massively scale their services.\n\n\\-Significantly reduced their deployment from Months down to Hours and Days.\n\n\\-Ontology create a overview and blueprint of the entire organization and see how each component interact in real-time.\n\n\\-Modular of their foundry software for small and mid-size business\n\n\\-Recent partnership with IBM increase palantir's Sales force from less than 30 to over 2000. Palantir was able to grow to \\~1 Billion annually revenue with virtually no salespeople before 2020.\n\n\\-no code, abstract away time consuming processes, saving organization from hiring costly computer scientist, giving business managers/executive with no coding background, no CS degree, or no data science degree ability to contribute and make meaning decisions from the bottom up. Just like Windows did for the personal PC, Palantir is doing it for data analytics and AI. This is a big deal. The next frontier of technology after data analytics and AI, It is going to be bigger than the internet.\n\n\\-Allow data from different silos and types to flow in real-time to make better decisions. What life have taught me is that making the right decision at the right time is the most important thing in the world.\n\n\\-Constantly adding new features and making improvements to existing product line. Foundry for business was only released in a couple years ago and Apollo was only released in 2020, but it already made significant impact on their up and bottom line.\n\n\\- There is no doubt that big data analytics and AI is next technology that is going starting to go mainstream and is going to be a big game changers and will create massive wealth for first adaptors because it is a winner takes all market.\n\nThe progress of technology:\n\nInternet-&gt;Personal PC-&gt;Web Search-&gt;Ecommerce-&gt;Social Media-&gt;Smartphone-&gt;Cyber Security-&gt;Cloud Computing-&gt;Streaming-&gt;cryptocurrency-&gt;Automation-&gt;Data Analytics-&gt;AI\n\nData Analytics-&gt;AI is the last frontier and will create the most value and wealth because their application is limitless.",

        "selftext": "First DD. Let me tell you why this is ready to moon:\n\nShort interest: Apes learning to squeeze has been the greatest revelation since the discovery of FYRE by Billy McFarland. I will keep this one short. 47.25% short to be exact (relative to float). 2nd most shorted stock after our first true love $GME. Pretty squeezable if you ask me.\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com\n\nAnd for all you GME Tards out there downvoting this... MELVIN CAPITAL IS BETTING AGAINST THIS STOCK. HERE ARE THE PUTS THEY OWN\nhttps://fintel.io/so/us/skt/melvin-capital-management-lp\n\nSmall market cap: As of today this company is worth 1.52 billion. $RKT Market Cap moved from approximately $40bn to $80bn in two days this week, and arguably has more upside to go. If $SKT market cap were to increase the same amount, it\u2019s a 27x BAGGER!!!!! This stock can LITERALLY go to $400+ based on previous experience alone, AND there\u2019s much higher SI. \n\nBuilding Awareness: I set myself up for $RKT and $GME by getting in ahead of the general curve. I am 2/2 on meme stocks so far, and this sweet sweet baby is sitting right in our wheelhouse. I watched as it started to shudder AH yesterday\u2026 and I knew it was time to bust out the vaseline but my wife\u2019s boyfriend already used it all. \n\nCommon sense: Does anybody really think shopping centres are going to be a thing of the past?? If I\u2019m spending my tendies to buy clothes I\u2019m sure as hell going to try them on. Sentiment is changing FAST. All lagging stocks have finally started booming, Texas dropped restrictions, $SKT go BOOOM \ud83d\ude80\n\nOpen Interest: the call to put ratio is looking TASTY as of late. Lots of new calls being opened, and puts are down.\nhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKT/options?p=SKT\n\nThe name: I predict Lil\u2019 Jon will be the number one artist of 2021 when this mafucka leaves the stratosphere. Worth a buy just for the memes\n\nMisc info for your reading pleasure: \n\n* Quarterly Dividend of 4.33% implies health and balance sheet strength. Also free tendies.\n* Price action steadily climbing since March 2020 crash. SUPER healthy chart movement over 1yr. Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s even shorted right now tbh, those HF\u2019s must already be lighting money on fyre. \n* Brick and mortar isn\u2019t going anywhere\n* Some guy on here said he drove by a mall and the parking lot was full\n\nTL;DR this is the next $RKT but\u2026. dare I say better? \n\nResume and disclaimer:\n\nI hit 732.67% gains on $RKT calls bought this week. I sold at $33 like a PAB but got in way ahead of the curve. \n\n$SKT Positions:\n4/16 20c \n4/16 25c\n\nAnd fuck it. If this hits $250 WSB can vote on my tattoo.\n\nWelcome to the next. Big. SHORT. AWWWWW $SKT $SKT MAFUCKAS \ud83d\ude80\n\nNot financial advice.\n\nEdit: removed a few statements I made sarcastically, they went over a few ppl\u2019s heads.",

        "selftext": "So my ~~colleague~~ wifes boyfriend, who has no reddit account and wishes to have no association with you autists, has been doing some maths (or math for you americans) in an attempt to back solve Short interest, using short volume &amp; trading volume. The base idea behind his findings was that any short volume over 50% cannot be 100% covered that day... so he just thought - how much can these short boys actually cover, if all shorts opened were intended to be covered...\n\nHere's what he's worked out spoiler alert:&gt;!shorts r more fuk than bears!&lt;\n\n\"So, I have been freaking the fuck out about this.  I am of the belief that at one point, FINRA said the truth about SI%... Being 226% on the 15th of january.  I had thought it was impossible to figure out what it was now, but then I started digging into the Short Volume to my attention.\n\nAt first, I had thought that it would be interesting if we could see how much they could have covered if 100% of long volume transfers went to covering shorts (Short Overflow)...\n\nSo then, I got a thought... let me manually import the short volume data since the 15th and see where this could go.\n\nSo from the FINRA report I got:\n\n* Short Volume\n* Short Exempt Volume\n* Exchanged Volume (Long Volume + Short Volume)\n\nFrom Yahoo Historical Data I got:\n\n* Total Trade Volume\n* Day's Closing\n* Day's low\n\nThen I calculated this: Total Short Volume (SV + SEV)\n\n* Long Volume (ExV - SV)\n* SV% (TSV / EV)\n* Off Exchange Volume (TV - EV)\n* Short Overflow (TSV - LV)\n\nI realized that this all cost them a fuck ton.\n\nSo I said:  If they covered through calls, then they as an extreme minimum paid 40$/share for them AND only would do so when GME was on the way up as it would be a waste of money otherwise. Thus I made MinimalCost of OFF-Exchange as (OEV \\* $40).\n\nIf they covered through Long Volume on market, then we'd be able to estimate that CONSERVATIVELY by comparing the days low to the Daily long volume (Day's Low \\* LV).\n\nThen came to the conclusion of the data:\n\nI wrote down the FINVIZ float, the SI% from FINRA, and derived the Short Volume at the time. THEN, I made 3 tables:\n\n* Table 1: Shows how many Shorts are there at different intervals of covering on Off-market and On-market.\n* Table 2: Shows the cost of doing those coverings.\n* Table 3: Shows the new SI%.\n\nIN CONCLUSION:   Using My data, I was able to derive that the **535.9% SI%** being passed around would cost Short Sellers 25 BILLION DOLLARS theoretically.\n\nThe **Maximum SI% can be rn is 942.06%.**\n\nIt is **litterally impossible for it to be under 200% rn** as it would be too costly.\n\nI believe that SI% is over 600%, as I believe that certain companies ran while they could, spending 10 billion dollars AT MOST between them all for covering.\n\nNOTE: NONE OF THIS EVEN TAKES INTEREST INTO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR COSTS, IT IS ALL JUST THEORETICAL COVERING COSTS ALONE. THE DATA DOES NOT SUPPORT THEM HAVING COVERED MUCH AT ALL, YOU TAKE FROM THIS WHAT YOU WILL. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR DONT COME BITCHING.\"\n\nThank you for coming to his TED talk.   \n\n\n**TL:DR SHORTS CAN'T STOP WONT STOP SHORTING. WE GOING TO THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE \ud83d\ude80**",

        "selftext": "REPOST because I accidently included a relevant YouTube link in an edit (about a DRYS short squeeze) and this caused the automoderator to delete it). Sorry!\n\nAlso, since I got feedback I didn't include enough Emojis, here's a rectification:\n\n \n\n# \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83c\udf19\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\nFirst, let's look at the players involved here.\n\n# The shorts\n\nOn the short side, we have some hedge funds (most notably Melvin and Citadel) who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain.\n\n# The Market Makers (may have some overlap with the shorts)\n\nMarker makers write options (contracts to be allowed to buy (call) or sell (put) shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date). They collect a fee for selling those contracts, but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless, because then they get to keep their fee, and don't need to keep their contract because it wasn't in the money. How does this work? Well, for example when GME was trading around $40, they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so, never expecting the price of GME to even reach anywhere near $800, so the \"fools\" who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls, or so they thought. (More on this later).\n\n# The longs\n\nOn the long side, we have you glorious apes  \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d, Cohen, and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on Melvin and other shorts, especially if they can make some money while doing so.\n\nNow let's look at the actions that have led up to this.\n\nIt all started when the shorts were getting greedy, and with Covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster. They did not expect gamestop would survive covid, and they did everything in their power to make it so. Shorting the company to the ground, with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and tax-free profit. It's important to point out that they COULD have covered at $3\\~$4 but DID NOT. If they did not cover at $3 or $4, what makes you think they covered at $40\\~$400? Hint: they didn't. In fact, they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400+ was just a gamma squeeze. In other words they have not even begun to cover yet.\n\n[Then some people liked the stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1p4up/a_refresher_on_what_the_is_going_on_with_gme/)\n\n[Some people have calculated that the real short interest in somewhere between 250% and 967%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/). (something like 200 million to 500 million shares short). Some people may think this is insane, but if you do the math, you will see that no matter what FINRA says, it's impossible for short interest to be below 200%, and it's more likely to be around 500\\~600%. It's hard to find reliable data, but if you just look at the volume and price action, it's obvious that the shorts have only INCREASED since January 28th, not decreased. It is mathematically IMPOSSABLE for the shorts to have covered. It simply doesn't add up.\n\n# How the Gamma squeeze will trigger the short squeeze\n\nSome people doubt this could reach $10k or even $100k, just as people doubted it could reach $1000s. But here is why those numbers are not only likely, but MATHEMATICALLY INEVITABLE. (I'm not an expert to so take it FWIW, feel free to call me an idiot, but if I'm right, I'll expect apologies).\n\nFirst, let's look at the option interest (source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Strike|Open interest March 12th|Open interest 19th|Shares (combined 12+19)|Shares (combined 12+19 cummulative)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|250|3231|2842|607,300|607,300|\n|255|563|0|56,300|663,300|\n|260|1047|542|158,900|822,500|\n|265|303|0|30,300|852,800|\n|270|788|748|153,600|1,006,400|\n|275|1386|0|138,600|1,145,000|\n|280|595|319|91,400|1,236,400|\n|285|303|0|30,300|1,266,700|\n|290|268|299|56,700|1,323,400|\n|295|323|0|32,300|1,355,700|\n|297.5|475|0|47,500|1,403,200|\n|300|7,011|5,389|1,240,000|2,643,200|\n|302.5|131|0|13,100|2,643,200|\n|305|276|0|27,600|2,683,900|\n|307.5|77|0|7,700|2,691,600|\n|310|660|307|96,700|2,788,300|\n|312.5|106|0|10,600|2,798,900|\n|315|683|0|68,300|2,867,200|\n|320|406|908|131,400|2,998,600|\n|325|313|0|31,300|3,029,900|\n|330|374|264|63,800|3,093,700|\n|332.5|130|0|13,000|3,106,700|\n|335|124|0|12,400|3,119,100|\n|337.5|48|0|4,800|3,123,900|\n|340|587|244|83,100|3,207,000|\n|345|622|0|62,200|3,269,200|\n|350|1876|2426|430,200|3,699,400|\n|355|122|0|12,200|3,711,600|\n|360|1151|344|149,500|3,861,100|\n|365|78|0|7,800|3,868,900|\n|370|103|351|45,400|3,914,300|\n|375|106|0|10,600|3,924,900|\n|380|290|396|68,600|3,993,500|\n|385|112|0|11,200|4,004,700|\n|390|354|508|86,200|4,090,900|\n|395|223|0|22,300|4,113,200|\n|400|3527|5156|868,300|4,981,500|\n|405|189|0|18,900|5,000,400|\n|410|173|258|43,100|5,0043,500|\n|\ud83c\udf3f\u2697\ufe0f|605|1246|185,100|5,228,600|\n|430|211|130|34,100|5,262,700|\n|440|176|176|35,200|5,297,900|\n|450|558|604|116,200|5,414,100|\n|460|276|129|40,500|5,454,600|\n|470|215|210|42,500|5,497,100|\n|480|156|323|47,900|5,545,000|\n|490|166|314|48,000|5,593,000|\n|500|3,149|7,122|1,027,100|6,620,100|\n|510|259|496|75,500|6,695,600|\n|520|393|714|110,700|6,806,300|\n|530|252|168|42,000|6,848,300|\n|540|129|161|29,000|6,877,300|\n|550|490|1557|204,700|7,082,000|\n|560|198|218|41,600|7,123,600|\n|570|305|194|49,900|7,173,500|\n|580|94|615|70,900|7,244,400|\n|590|87|272|35,900|7,280,300|\n|600|1715|2065|378,000|7,658,300|\n|610|99|180|27,900|7,686,200|\n|620|117|153|27,000|7,713,200|\n|630|98|112|21,000|7,713,200|\n|640|326|250|57,600|7,791,800|\n|650|464|456|92,000|7,883,800|\n|660|320|147|46,700|7,930,500|\n|680|198|289|48,700|7,979,200|\n|700|1189|1264|245,300|8,224,500|\n|720|210|299|50,900|8,224,500|\n|740|307|239|54,600|8,330,000|\n|760|659|358|101,700|8,431,700|\n|780|1936|1060|299,600|8,731,300|\n|800|22,244|27,686|4,993,000|13,724,000|\n\nNow, it's important to mention that the MMs will try to stay delta-neutral. In other words, they will start buying BEFORE the price hits strike price. When the MMs sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40, they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that GME would hit $800 by march 12th. However, now, that chance is approaching 1% and climbing. The MMs still don't need to cover fully, but they are starting to consider the CHANCE of it happening is becoming more and more likely. So for each option (remember each option is 100 shares) they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1% chance of it happening. But this very act may CAUSE it to happen.\n\nAt some point, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because MMs are 'insuring' their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up, the price actually goes up, which means they need to insure even more, which creates a snowball effect. All the way up to, or beyond, the last option, which is at strike price $800.\n\nSimilarly, the MMs probably considered it about maybe 5% likely that GME would hit 300 this week, but now it's more like 95% like, which means for each option contract with STRIKE 300, they will be buying 90 shares BEFORE the price hits 300 (which means about a million shares bought, which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place!) They do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in AFTER the price reached PAST 300 (then they will DEFINITLY make a loss). At least if they buy in BEFORE the price reaches $300, they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses.\n\nRemember, all parties are TRYING to make money, but not all of them succeed. So MMs are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days, and looking at the above table, this will likely push the price towards, and likely over $800 either this week, or next week.\n\nYou can also see in some particular numbers there's a LOT of shares that need to be covered, expect a lot of action when we APPROACH those numbers (for example, $300, $350, $400, $420, $500 and of course $800) as you can see, some of those numbers are close, and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point.\n\n# This is only the GAMMA SQUEEZE. Now what about the short squeeze?\n\nSome people ask: \"Why don't the shorts just wait for the rally to be over, and buy when the price drops back to normal levels?\" Simple answer: they can't. Melvin was already down 53% the last time and they didn't even cover (that was just a gamma squeeze, by their own words). When a hedge fund has a short position, they can keep that position, as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves. If the price of the asset they are short increases drastically (like in the event of a gamma squeeze), they will be FORCED to buy. As an example, let's say Hedge Fund M has $100 billion worth of assets, and shorts Company G for $1 billion at $10 per share. Now the price goes to $1000 per share, so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts. This is an unacceptable risk, as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover. So they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted. However, this very act will drive up the price (if you want to know how, read up on order books and slippage, this post is getting long enough as it is).\n\nIn fact, this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy, but seeing as Melvin managed to lose 53% and still didn't cover, it seems likely Melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses, and will ACTUALLY go bankrupt. This will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses. The clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble (I'm pretty sure that's illegal). So the clearing houses would cover IMMEDIATLY, regardless of costs. Even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air. So TL;DR, it's a short squeeze because the shorts are FORCED to buy back their shorts, one way or another. Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares (while only about 50 million or fewer are available) this will be \"name your price\" kind of prices. This is where $100k is NOT a meme.\n\n# IMPORTANT LAST POINT:\n\n**Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next, there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future. Remember, it doesn't cost us anything to HODL, but it does cost them a lot to SHORT. Every day they are losing MILLIONS. Every day we keep the price above $0 is a WIN for us.**\n\nEdit: those who still doubt $100k because it would make the market cap too high, DRYS went to $1.5 BILLION PER SHARE during a short squeeze. Let that sink in.",

        "selftext": "Over the last couple of weeks, there have been dozens of posts deliberating whether or not to sell growth/tech stocks that have been dropping recently and switch over to \"re-opening\" or value plays. The key take away here has to be this:\n\nIf a 10% drop in a stock makes you wonder whether or not you should sell that stock, you should have never bought that stock in the first place.\n\nContrary to popular belief, stocks do not always go up. In fact, most stocks fail to beat the market in the long-term, with few exceptions. Buffet makes this clear. A good stock is not considered good just because it may do well in the next year, or because it has shown growth in the past. It is only a good buy if it has value beyond a short-term horizon, and most importantly, IF YOU BUY AT THE RIGHT PRICE. If you had bought GE at its peak, a company that is invested in all aspects of life and won't ever disappear, you would be down nearly 75%. Why is this? Is GE a bad company, with bad products, or a shrinking customer base? No, you would have just bought in at a price that was unjustifiable. \n\nThink of this scenario, you are the owner of a snack shop. Summer is coming up, so you decide to invest in significant inventory of ice cream. After all, people will purchase frozen desserts in the hot summer days, right? This can't possibly bad investment. So you go to your supplier, and he offers you a price of $100 per pint of ice-cream. What would you do? Would you buy just because ice-cream is guaranteed to sell in the future? No, not unless customers were willing to pay more than $100 per pint.\n\nConversely, your next-door competitor decides to invest in inventory of hot chocolate. This is ridiculous to you, who would buy hot chocolate in the summer? However, your neighbor buys in at $0.10 per cup of hot chocolate for his supply. Once summer is over, you sell out of your inventory, but at a loss because no one is willing to buy ice cream at more than $10 a pint. Then winter comes, and guess who profits more?\n\nThe point here is that being right about a trend is not enough if the price you buy in at is not the right one. If your belief in a stock is rattled because it drops a little bit, you did not believe in the price in the first place. If this scares you enough, you are better off sticking to index funds and filtering out the noise. There is nothing wrong with that, picking stocks is hard, and there is no guarantee that you will come out on top. \n\nMy two cents is this: lumping tech into one single asset class is absurd, and calling companies like Amazon and Microsoft \"growth\" stocks is disingenuous if you lump in Palantir and Tesla in that same category. The market right now is doing just that, however, in the sense that high-PE growth stocks like Tesla are dropping alongside with Apple. In my opinion, all this is doing in the long-run is that you are buying tried-and-true blue chips at a discount. \n\nKohl's is not going to be larger in 10 years than it is now, and its price now does not make it a good buy.  Conversely, just because Tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a PE of 1000+ is a wise investment. Re-opening plays are just market chatter. Cruise lines have tremendous debt, banks are tied to risky-credit loans and government regulation, and oil companies are at the mercy of an overseas oil cartel. Just because they are outperforming now, does not mean they will be a good buy if the current price does not reflect their value in the long-term.\n\nBuy into valuable companies (future growth, good price) at a discount, ignore short-term market sentiment, and invest in index funds if you do not feel strong enough convictions in your stock picks.",

The technicals all point BULLISH signals and signify GME is going much higher.\n\n**Case 1 : VOLUME**\n\nLook at the volume and price action for the last few weeks. Volume was actually decreasing from Feb 25 to Mar 3, and the price went UP, this is extremely bullish. Typically, if price stays flat or up on decreasing volume, this is bullish.\n\nSecondly, since Mar 3, we have seen increasing volume with higher prices. This is bullish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Holy shit! ](https://preview.redd.it/40z53odskvl61.jpg?width=467&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28bacefabefab34d59ba5a2cf2a64b132afdc484)\n\n \n\n**Case 2 : MACD**\n\nMACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and essentially shows the relationship between two moving averages. The crossover occurred when Ryan Cohen tweeted his infamous McDonald's vanilla ice cream cone photo (coincidence?). MACD shows strong momentum and is pointing GME to higher prices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Looks Bullish](https://preview.redd.it/s30997zukvl61.jpg?width=493&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e200ddb9c0a88284cce5c7c430806e4eff11222d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Case 3 : AVAILABLE SHARES TO SHORT**\n\nFrom last Friday to today, the shares available to short have dropped a whopping 600,000 SHARES! Yet the price is up 35%+ today. This is extremely bullish, the shorts can't even drop the price given 600,000 shorted shares. Now keep in mind, this is counting the shares that are available to short, and does not include the millions of shares that are ALREADY shorted. If GME continues to climb higher, the short sellers may be margin called and forced to sell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[600,000 shorted! ](https://preview.redd.it/9aaem6vxkvl61.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c2e0447f1c71e3c441110abad4bc6cb712b2627)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThere are a lot more tailwinds that can catalyze GME. This analysis doesn't even consider the possibility of another gamma squeeze or how many shares are now becoming ITM or \"In The Money\". This will require Market Makers to purchase additional GME shares if they don't have it in possession on exercise.\n\nThis also doesn't consider the fundamental change in the company and how to properly revalue GameStop from a traditional brick and mortar to an e-commerce player.\n\nThe technicals signify bullishness and you should continue HODL.

        "selftext": "Ok look apes, I have been following the GME trends since before the first squeeze. Needless to say, much like the rest of you, I have spent hours upon hours looking at the trends, shorts, and data since the day of reckoning last month. \n\n**And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread** (especially with RKT)\n\n**To simply put it,** in my opinion, **we are on the verge of something big**... \n\n**TL:DR at the bottom for the most atuist**\n\nHere is why my fellow tards,\n\n1) **We have proven the community strength**, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some **green** for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote \"**Lackluster day**\" we are still up **162.5%** the past WEEK!\n\n2) **A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???** Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but **it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.** Don't take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other **\"GAMMA SQUEEZE\" for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.** \n\n3) The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know **that they have lost billions.** Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high. \n\nSOURCE: Wall Street Journal, 5 days ago. \n\n*Processing img v59kaj2xapk61...*\n\n**Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.** I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, **how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can't- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)** \n\n4) **With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.** Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. **But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.** In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze. \n\n[F ROBINHOOD](https://preview.redd.it/w55we4o6dpk61.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e211a49e42220b19f3998f6c764a4dbd428c5bb0)\n\n5) **I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold. Here is why:** \n\n\\-They have landed a **huge** multi-year deal with micro soft.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dvfklepdpk61.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5b6fb6667ffa99e41bb73b473f9ecb0f25e8f9d\n\n\\-**They fired their insanely incompetent CFO Jim Bell,** seriously look him up dude was a douche.\n\nthis shows seriously **promising financial redevelopment for GME.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[STILL F ROBINHOOD](https://preview.redd.it/q5m4zzdjepk61.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44bddf0d683a160630575ae539c13438fff57204)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-**New wave of modernization in the gaming world. As a gamer myself, not to brag, I would love to see GME rise and take over as the ultimate streaming platform, and with the new push for the future and deals that just landed, I think that there is a pretty good chance this will happen.** \n\n**TL:DR- IMO I think we have this. There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a \"NEW SQUEEZE RKT\" (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding. IMO if we break resistance at 130, there will be some serious momentum.**   \n\n\n**IN SORT HOLD THE MF LINES RETARDS- I am not an advisor we just like the stock.**",

        "selftext": "EDIT: Based on the fact that a number of comments seem to have been made without reading beyond the first 9 words of the title, and the fact that this is sitting at 60% upvoted, I'd encourage you to at least read to the TLDR.\n\nI usually stick to providing raw data, but this post has a little bit of added analysis. I don\u2019t own $GME or $RKT (I don't actively invest to avoid accusations of bias in my data) and don\u2019t like either stock over the other. I do like WSB though and don\u2019t like baseless conspiracy theories, and I have seen a lot of conspiracy theories flying around WSB recently without much evidence to accompany them. Most recently, I got flooded by comments like this on my data post yesterday.\n\n[Comments](https://preview.redd.it/baa7ritypuk61.png?width=1432&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6b8eab6ff5519aac82a87a06e742d52aa74440e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe goal of this post was to look at one of those theories and see if I can provide a base for it. The theory in question is \u201c$RKT discussion is being artificially pushed to distract from $GME\u201d. A TLDR of my analysis is:\n\n**A) Both $RKT and $GME are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on WSB.**\n\n**B) Accounts discussing $GME are actually newer to WSB on average than accounts discussing $RKT**\n\n**C) There are a small, but non-zero, number of people trying to artificially manipulate discussion to get others to sell $GME. However, this is done with no relation to $RKT.**\n\n**D) Accounts mentioning $GME and $RKT behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks.**\n\nThrough my analysis I wasn\u2019t able to find any solid evidence of $RKT being artificially pushed as a distraction from $GME. While it\u2019s easy to complain about u/zjz's iron-fisted bot army, I think it deserves a lot of credit for curbing attempts at manipulation.\n\nNow I will provide the data backing up these conclusions, and call out one account I did find attempting to artificially manipulate discussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Both $RKT and $GME are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on WSB. Accounts discussing $GME are actually newer to WSB on average than accounts discussing $RKT.**\n\nI don\u2019t think I need to patronize you with a bunch of facts and figures showing how much attention has been drawn to wsb recently. Obviously this attention came with a lot of new posters, and that\u2019s fully on display when we look at when accounts talking about $GME and $RKT first joined the wsb community. The motive behind looking at these numbers was to determine whether there were a bunch of new accounts who joined the community with the sole purpose of distracting from $GME.\n\nThe average $RKT poster first posted on wsb on December 10th, 2020. This is pretty shockingly young, but the average $GME poster is even newer to the community with an average date of December 22nd, 2020.\n\nHere are histograms showing when the accounts mentioning both stocks first joined the community, by year:\n\n[RKT Histogram](https://preview.redd.it/qp652yp7quk61.png?width=1726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cc3b954aea59a00e2a3f0e570b825e614c0cec0)\n\n[GME Histogram](https://preview.redd.it/d79kdzu8quk61.png?width=1726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95408f675b12f97cbd9231e71fa96aac0c43b1d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**There is a non-zero number of people trying to manipulate discussion to get others to sell $GME, but not enough to have a significant effect.**\n\nOne other thing I examined was how much different accounts were shilling $GME and $RKT. For the most part, there wasn\u2019t too much spam of either ticker by individual accounts with a few notable exceptions. Below are scatter plots showing accounts with the date they joined WSB on the x-axis and the number of times they have mentioned $GME/$RKT in the last 5 days on the y-axis.\n\n[$GME date joined vs. mentions](https://preview.redd.it/g9vgmq6gquk61.png?width=1852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73571b1836771fc0c8fa3c80eebd738d13bd5d9b)\n\n[$RKT date joined vs. mentions](https://preview.redd.it/0a8xwqlkquk61.png?width=1752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e79bb797abbdf49eb43b4c7fd94c4541c6d58b)\n\nThere are 3 prominent outliers that I will examine, one of which I think probably deserves some sort of moderator action. On the $GME graph we have /u/char1101g way out in the upper right. He just started posting on here yesterday, and has been just absolutely spamming anti-GME shit since. Although posts like \"SELL YOU GME STOCK\" seem to match the grammar and speech patterns expected of a short-only investor, I don't really see this single example as solid evidence of a larger artificial anti-GME push.\n\nOn the $RKT side of things we have two accounts that are pretty clearly tied to real people, so I don\u2019t want to call them out by username. While I\u2019d say they\u2019re pretty clearly innocent of being hedge fund accounts (old accounts, lots of personal info, lots of non-wsb posts), they\u2019re absolutely guilty of living in the discussion threads, with dozens of comments already today. You could probably make an argument that someone commenting about $RKT all day long is having some impact on the overall discussion, but given that it\u2019s just two random dudes I kind of doubt it has much of an effect in the grand scheme of things.\n\n**Accounts mentioning $GME and $RKT behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks.**\n\nThe last thing I wanted to look at was how accounts behaved in promoting $GME and $RKT. In particular, I wanted to see if accounts mentioning either stock were more likely to mention it repeatedly. I ended up not finding much of a significant difference. Below is a table where $GME/$RKT accounts are defined as accounts mentioning each respective stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Mentions of $RKT/$GME over last 5 days|$RKT accounts|$GME accounts|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\&gt;1|.806|.801|\n|\\&gt;2|.653|.657|\n|\\&gt;5|.454|.433|\n|\\&gt;10|.331|.310|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a pretty small overlap (34%) between people talking about $GME and people talking about $RKT, likely leading to some of the conflict that we have seen, but from my research I wasn't able to find any solid evidence of $RKT being artificially pushed as a distraction from $GME.  That being said, I'm happy to hear criticisms on my work, let me know below if you have any thoughts.",

        "selftext": "Today\u2019s dip was fucking delicious but it taught us a few things:\n\n1.) Remove your fucking stop losses how the fuck does this need to be said. Why are you letting a robot \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb for you?\n\n2.) Half of y\u2019all are fucking gods who bought the dip, and got a damn STEAL on some guaranteed lottery tickets \n\n3.) The other half of y\u2019all weren\u2019t actually waiting on a dip (even though you guys spam it for upvotes like fucking degenerate gremlins) and pussied out when it was time to display our nuts out for the hedgies to assert our dominance.\n\nThe actual important shit:\n\n1.) They are running out of ammo, those drop had fuck all volume behind them. That short attack topped any of the previous attacks, even going back to January. They\u2019re running out of short volume and they know it. We are (for real this time) in the endgame \n\n2.) CNBC and other shill outlets are tightly gagged, we are seeing tangibly less coverage across the board than at this point of the stock price a month ago. Only rarely to be released to revel in any tiny downtick of the share price. This is for a reason. Last time everybody was shitting themselves over GME, it was everywhere. And because of this, MANY retail investors hopped on the train and sucked up a lot of volume in a short period, hence the silence now. This is potentially a good thing because it means no influx of uneducated monkeys who know jack shit.\n\n3.) We need educate new members of this fuck wagon on what is going on. IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS.\n\nSide note: NEWBIES! YOU\u2019LL KNOW WHEN THE SQUEEZE IS HAPPENING! IT WILL FUCKING SKYROCKET *$1000+ MINIMUM. DONT SELL (unless you have to I know everyone has varying circumstances) DONT BUY UNLESS YOURE READY FOR A HIGH VOLATILITY STOCK. SHIT GOES UP DOWN BACK FORWARD, FUCKING BACKFLIPS.

        "selftext": " \n\n* 13% of float is shorted. This is high. There has been much less squeezing here then in RKT. More room to run.\n* UWMC is projected to have a better 2021 than 2020, and see an increase in EPS. This is opposed to RKT, which is expected to see a large drop.\n* Interest rate fears are overblown, and the fed continues to reiterate this fact. However, if rates do go up, UWMC is projected to hold up much better than RKT. Their business model does not rely on refinancing to the extent that RKT does.\n* Trades at a much lower P/E than RKT, and has done so for months.\n* Is still trading far below previous valuations, without any real reason for dropping down so low. This drop happened after blowout earnings, on interest/housing market fears. I believe the stock was also pushed down intentionally to allow for accumulation before index additions that wouldn\u2019t allow the stock to drop so low again.\n\n This is a good company that should see growth beyond current valuation. I don\u2019t think RKT presents the same opportunity after today. There are some bear cases to be made, especially regarding the large float and possible interest rises, but I don\u2019t see these concerns as significant right now.

        "selftext": "First off, let's go straight to the point. The last few weeks have been a bloodbath for most of the market. To many, especially new traders, this seems like a full blown market crash. Well, it's not... a market crash needs a catalyst. Think back to every single crash, whether it was the dot com bubble, the housing bubble in 08, and even the flash crash on black Monday in 87' they all had a catalyst, if not many catalysts.\n\nI keep reading over and over again in the media that the bond yeilds jumping is the reason for this market crash speculation. Let's think about this for a second though - besides the fed trying to hammer home the message to investors that the bond yeilds are absolutely no cause for concern, and actually it's not even close to reaching concerning territory yet, as well as the bond yeilds are actually signaling strength in the economy - how in the world do people come to conclusion that the market is about to crash because of this? Is there any real basis to this? Ask yourself this.\n\n Another narrative that i keep seeing the media push is \"the economy is overheating\". Seriously? What does that even mean? The economy is recovering so fast that the market is going to crash? This has to be the most insane thing I've read yet. I can also note that the same journalists who publish this FUD about overheating, are the same journalists who will also write that the market is crashing when there is BAD economic data (such as the job report this morning). So let's ask ourselves, how can both a booming recovery and a slow, painful recovery BOTH be ingredients for a crash? I cannot comprehend how ridiculous this is becoming. Good news = market crash, bad news = market crash. What do we need for the market not to crash? \n\nI can't talk about all of this without mentioning a wild phenomenon. My portfolio. A very well diversified array of etfs which hit almost all sectors of the market. The best thing to happen to it? A global pandemic/ lockdown. The worst thing? Economic strength indicators, covid cases plummeting and vaccines and stimulus getting pumped into the masses. Has the world gone mad?\n\nMy conclusion is only this. Plain and simple, fear. Fear is what's bringing this bloodbath upon us. Panic selling over irrational news articles. Just compare the VIX (fear gauge) chart with almost every single tech stock or major company's stock chart. It's literally an inverse. A mirror image.\n\nIf there is anything to take away from this is that I truly believe this is just mass hysteria and it the dust will settle. Stocks will rise again. Invest in what you believe in and avoid the FUD that's being pumped out for click bait by seemingly every news outlet.\n\nTl;dr: there is no crash. This is panic selling on a mass scale. Don't believe the media fud - the pandemic is ending and there is light at the end of this Corona virus tunnel. Buy the dip with money you can afford to potentially lose and all shall be good again on wallstreet. *Edit* I am not an expert, do not take this as financial advice. I was merely venting/ ranting during this paragraph. Only invest what you are willing to lose. \n\nEdit: I almost forgot to mention a big one: \n\nAnother theory that is floating around is the market being in a bubble. This is probably the most spread rumor. This one is pretty simple to shut down I think. Earnings season was insane. Comoanjes blew estimates out of the water left and right. Banks, big tech, e commerce, etc. These are the sectors that are being targeted heavily by fud in the media. These are also the companies doing the best they ever have. So how is this a bubble? Of course, companies like tesla and gamestop (lol) can be viewed and argued as in a bubble. But these companies are few and far between.\n\nEdit#2 as someone here pointed out, the current p/e ratio is at around 40 for the s&amp;p500. Is this really a cause for concern? The all time high for p/e of the s&amp;p is may 2009. Arguably one of the best times in history to buy stocks as we now know. So can someone explain why this is repeatedly cited as a cause for concern? What am I missing?",

        "selftext": "Hi all, \nI\u2019m not sure if this type of post is allowed, so please delete if necessary. I could use some support and guidance, after what feels like a devastating few weeks. \n\nJust a few weeks ago, before this chop, I was flying high as I\u2019m sure many others were. I had accumulated some healthy options winnings, over the last several weeks and felt like I was in a good place to hold my ITM calls with May DTEs. I was strategic about my buys, and many were very much green. Some 100%+. \n\nThe first red day sucked, but I told myself it was a healthy pullback. Buy the dip is a common mantra and it\u2019s what i did. And here\u2019s where I just don\u2019t understand what the hell happened to me. Red days started piling up and I just held. Telling myself that the rebound was around the corner and I had until May, July, and Jan 2022. Convincing myself that the worst was behind us. 3 red days turned into 4, 5, and the next thing I know I\u2019m down all my gains. You\u2019d think I\u2019d sell right? No fucking way. A slew of monster green days was just around the corner. Finally, after last Friday I sold all of my May calls, and held my July and Jan 2022 calls. Both red now... (ARKK 1/22 $97c -$50 &amp;amp;amp; ARKG 7/16 $94c -$3,699) My ARKK I was up $2k now down $50, my ARKG I was up $500 and now down almost $3700. Since ARKG has a few months left, I feel like I have to give them more time, but this is fucking stupid I know...\n\nSo here I sit, lost all of my gains. I\u2019m -25% overall on my account. My wife doesn\u2019t know, and I want to scream. It\u2019s like I just sat back and watched as the world burned and did nothing about it. Which is weird since I normally respect my stops.\n\nThose of you who blew up your accounts, how did you get back on the horse? How did you handle the humiliation? I know I need to take a step back, but I\u2019m still holding these stupid call options. Someone please kick me in the ass. \n\nThanks for listening.\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for the advice and encouraging words. I truly appreciate it. I realize I\u2019m handling this like a little bitch, but it stings and there\u2019s some value in community and sharing. Especially during these times of isolation. This situation will certainly lead to some self-reflection of my own human faults. My emotional relationship and emotions around money, my inaction during times of distress, fallacies and biases that cloud my judgement and decision making, and my overall emotional state when things are stressful in the market all require some in-depth analysis. All I know is that I can\u2019t and won\u2019t quit. I\u2019ve come too far to just give up. I will step back for a few days/weeks and develop a strategy to recoup my losses. Whether it\u2019s selling theta or just holding boomer commons, I\u2019ll figure this shit out. Someway somehow. Thanks again \u270c\ud83c\udffc",

Pundits blamed the market plunge on Fed hiking rates, the 'china trade war', and fears of economic slowdown. But recall that 1) the market recovered in a V shape days after December ended, without the Fed deciding to reverse course on the rate hike, 2) that the market was unfazed by trade war headlines nearly all year long, and 3) the economic growth data remained incredibly positive and strong. **The December 2018 drop was irrational.**\n\nThis look back at recent history goes to show how irrational markets can be and it is up to us to take advantage.\n\nFor today:\n\n1. the Fed is NOT raising rates and have said this repeatedly.\n\n2. the economy is recovering and there is little data suggesting any upcoming slowdown or recession.\n\n3. The fear now is about the fear of inflation/yields rising. Note that we don't have any data suggesting inflation is permanently here to stay. \n\nI think there are two solid conclusions: \n\n1) This is not a bear market happening before our eyes. It's a correction and buying the dip is the likely right move. An overall selloff right now, is irrational, **just like in December 2018**, with the exception of growth stocks that are very overvalued especially in the context of rising yields. \n\n2) No one can predict how deep this correction goes, but it would be prudent to buy the dip on cyclicals, financials, and growth stocks that are already undervalued \n\nPlease also note that the SP500 is now so heavily weighted to the top market cap growth tech stocks like FANG, that a 10% correction in them will require 90% increase in the bottom 100 stocks of the SP500 to avoid a fall. So the best way to increase your portfolio CAGR may not be to simply buy the dip in the SP500 index, but rather choosing the above sectors or stocks that avoid this weighting.",

        "selftext": "Alright y\u2019all, yesterday a lot of you apes bought in as the price zoomed up premarket and are now bagholding and freaking out. Don\u2019t fret my fellow degenerates. If you woke up and looked at the price premarket today you probably got spooked, but it has been a brutal 24 hours for the market. Good thing $UWMC is a long term hold! Yes there will be volatility this week and next as traders look for day trade and swing trade moves. But, I cannot wait for 3/19. \n\nI\u2019d argue yesterday was a pretty damn good day for $UWMC regardless of entry price. I personally would have used those dips to average down and accumulate some shares, but what do I know I\u2019m just a smooth brained bag holder. Anyway, UWMC still ended up green 5%. (Shoutout GME for finishing green as well!) Do I need to remind you guys what happened to $RKT yesterday? A lot of those investors jumped ship and hopped on $UWMC! But at the same time, $RKTs demise certainly scared some potential $UWMC investors away, kinda oxymoronic. UWMC has its own momentum, and will get to orbit regardless of what $RKT does due to all of the catalysts and intangibles I mentioned in my first [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwfasi/why_uwmc_is_most_definitely_the_play/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). \n\n(TLDR: Dividend date 3/10 and Russell 1000 &amp; 3000 index addition 3/22). \n\nThe shorts were ALL over UWMC yesterday. It went from 1,000,000 available shares shorted on 3/2, to under 90,000 shares available to short by market close yesterday. (Editing for transparency: looks like some shorts have closed their positions and it\u2019s up to 250,000 short shares available as of 9:15 https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc ) Of course the institutions are gonna jump all over this once they see WSB talking about it because they know there are a lot of paper hands who will get scared and sell, but diamond hands are needed to beat these losers \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c.\n\nWhile a short squeeze is certainly possible, I think the true potential comes in the form of a GAMMA SQUEEZE. Look at all these calls for 3/19 https://imgur.com/a/99Cx5LI \n\nIf $UWMC can stay above $10, this has the potential to go to Mars, and fly right past the moon! \n\nI would like to add that while all this options activity is fantastic, it will be all for nothing if the contracts aren\u2019t backed up with shares. I\u2019ll personally be loading up on shares while this thing is still reasonably priced.\n\nTake care of yourselves\n\nSince there\u2019s no daily thread for UWMC, feel free to unload here\n\nDisclaimer: I own shares of $UWMC and have contracts expiring in April and May. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.\n\nUpdate: [UWMC CEO just declared war on Rocket Mortgages](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2021/03/04/united-wholesale-mortgage-ultimatum-rocket-companies/4578357001/)",

        "selftext": "You've probably seen how [$RKT shares exploded higher due to an epic squeeze.](https://mainstbets.com/rocket-companies-nyse-rkt-stock/) A lot of traders have been looking for a sympathy play, and $UWMC comes to mind (formerly known as GHIV), another mortgage broker.\n\nHowever, after the deSPACing, the stock got rocked, but now it's starting to run higher. Of course, this actually makes sense. There are multiple catalysts on the table. Not only is there an upcoming special dividend, similar to $RKT, but there are 102M shares floating. In other words, there's not a whole lot of supply for everyday traders.\n\nWhen it comes to $UWMC, it's actually a profitable company and with about a $16B market cap at the time of this writing, it's eligible for index additions. $UWMC is eligible to be included in the Russell indices, as more than 5% of the company's total shares is in the free float. Moreover, $UWMC can also qualify to be included in the S&amp;P 500.\n\nThis potential demand and relatively low supply can cause this stock to get to $20+. The company also explosive earnings, and the dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to [shareholders of record as of the close on March 10.](https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Holdings-Corporation-Announces-UWMs-Record-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results-1.37-Billion-4Q20-Net-Income-and-Declares-First-Regular-Quarterly-Dividend-of-0.10-per-share/default.aspx)\n\nDisclaimer: I / We have a bullish position in $UWMC via options.  \n\n\nP.S.

        "selftext": "Why is the market tanking in recent weeks?\n\nFirst, what it isn't: Treasury yields.  Don't listen to the news.  This just means that no one wants to buy bonds so the price of bonds is going down to attract new investors.  This happens in a healthy economy.  Can't believe the fake news is really pushing this.\n\nWhat I would see if this was anything other than a correction:\n\nConsumer cyclical and natural resource holdings would increase with major investment firms.  Positions in small cap stocks would decrease.  Real estate holdings would increase.\n\nHow I know these things aren't happening:\n\nIt's best to track these activities through major firms and ETFs.  I track SPY's holdings daily.  They have teams of analysts and resources I just don't have.  They're the first to know.  I do not watch the news for financial information.\n\nSo what is it?\n\nI see firms reorganizing portfolio's for a post-C19 market.  IE, aerospace and defense stocks are going up - Raytheon is up 12%/Boeing up 16% in the same time the Nasdaq was down 9%.  Travel stocks like JetBlue are also doing well in that time frame.\n\nWhen will it stop?\n\nWho knows, but it couldn't have been expected and it's too late to sell high and buy low now.  I'm waiting it out.  I have been increasing positions with remaining cash but I'm out going forward.\n\nWill tech rebound?\n\nYes.  New tech is where the money is.  I see strong cross-sector growth continuing through Q3 this year.  Q1 industrial is very strong so far.  Many of these up and coming tech companies are going to be pushing into their manufacturing phases.",

        "selftext": "**$UWMC - Today's Rent, Tomorrow's Mortgage - United Wholesale Mortgage Trade Analysis**\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that $RKT is absolutely ripping. It\u2019s also no secret that you missed the fucking rocket. Once again, you\u2019re stuck bagholding dogshit while your friends are partying on the moon. I\u2019m here to tell you that it\u2019s all going to be okay. Do not FOMO into RKT while it's on its way back down to Earth. I\u2019ve got another rocket lined up, fueled, and ready to rip. Enter $UWMC.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Background\n\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage (UWMC) is a company who underwrites loans for independent mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers - Instead, borrowers mainly deal with the company's loan servicing department. They recently went public through the SPAC known as GHIV, and since then, their share price has unfortunately been on a steady decline, until today.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n\n\n#A Swing Play, a Value Play, and a Long Term Hold, All Rolled Into One\n\nAs /u/Winring86 eloquently stated, UWMC is a swing play, value play, and long term hold rolled into one. UWMC is in a very bullish position due to it being an ideal candidate for swing trading, value investing, and growth investing. This attracts people from a wide variety of investing backgrounds, ultimately giving it some insane exposure within the institutional, and retail spaces. Furthermore, there are a number of positive upcoming catalysts for UWMC, as well as positive analyst sentiment about long term prospects.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n\n\n#Swing Play\n\nCurrently, there are two swing-play catalysts in effect for UWMC. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Catalyst #1)** \n\nIt\u2019s in the same sector as RKT. We all see what\u2019s happening with that right now - It\u2019s the entire reason I even thought of this play to begin with. As much as people try to deny it, certain \u201cbaskets\u201d of stocks trade in relation to one another. This was most prominent during the GME squeeze. GME started ripping, and it started carrying other trash up with it, like AMC, NOK, BB, etc. The movement of these stocks seemed almost intertwined. GME ripped, and so did the other meme stocks. GME started drilling, and the rest followed suit. The exact same thing is happening in today's market environment. RKT is ripping, and it\u2019s drawing attention to other mortgage and finance stocks, causing them to gap up as well. So long as RKT keeps ripping, the rest should follow suit, and since UWMC is so much closer to it\u2019s floor (only up 20% compared to RKT\u2019s 120%), it results in us being able to place a much safer bet. Luckily, this isn\u2019t the only catalyst, which means that if RKT starts to go down, there may be a divergence among these equities, with UWMC continuing to trend upwards even after the RKT fiasco ends.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Catalyst #2)** \n\nOn the morning of March 1st, it was announced that UWMC will be added to the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 indices. These inclusions almost always result in a price increase, due to the indices and index funds having to purchase shares for exposure. Furthermore, this also results in the future potential for UWMC to be added to the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith the explosive growth of companies within the same sector, as well as index inclusion being right around the corner, UWMC seems like an extremely good candidate for a potential swing trade.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Deep Value Play\n\nFrom a strict fundamental perspective, UWMC is horribly undervalued. Many of the same principles /u/DeepFuckingValue uncovered in Gamestop are present in UWMC today. They have an incredible balance sheet, insane YoY growth, and fundamentally sound business prospects. These metrics include :\n\n- A P/E ratio of 3.8, compared to the sectors average of 14.0\n- Forward P/E of 6.11 compared to the sectors average of 11.0\n- **Q4 2020 Net Income of $1.37 billion and FY2020 net income of $3.38 billion - An 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively**\n- Q1 2021 expectations : 22.6% - 34.4% increase from Q1 2020\n- 5% Dividend, coming up on March 9th\n- High level of institutional ownership\n- Short Interest of around 35-45%\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUWMC absolutely brutalized their earnings, and are expected to continue dominating them well into the future. Smart money has loaded up on shares, and is waiting for liftoff. The current valuation of UWMC is criminal, and I can easily see this stock reaching into the high twenties over the course of the following year.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Long Term Prospects\n\nOn top of the deep value play, UWMC is also poised for steady, long term growth. UWMC is projected to have a better 2021 than 2020, and see a steady increase in EPS. This is starkly different from its peers, who are expected to experience the opposite - Most companies within the same sector are expected to have significantly worse years going forward, following the inevitable hike in interest rates, which UWMC actually looks forward to. Since UWMC is a mortgage lender, a hike in interest rates will result in an insane jump in profits for them as a company, leading to explosive growth. The company is poised for success even after the swing trades and value plays have run their course, and to me, that\u2019s extremely bullish.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Trading Strategies\n\nGiven that my thesis has convinced you, we arrive at the fun part of the article - the trading strategies. Overall, there are many ways to approach this trade, and I\u2019ll lay them out in relation to the type of play one would want to make.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a short term swing play, your best bet would likely be the April contracts at the $10 or $12.5 strikes. These options are trading dirt cheap, and if you believe that RKT and UWMC will continue to run in tandem with one another, these would prove to be an awesome pickup. These will likely be best to buy on or after March 10th, after the ex-dividend date, as stocks tend to drop post dividend. These contracts will give you exposure to the bullish runs within the mortgage sector, as well as the pre Russel index inclusion runup.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a deep (fucking) value play, you could look to sell ATM cash secured puts on the underlying and pray for assignment. Alternatively, you could outright buy a boatload of shares and LEAPS (similar to what DFV did with GME back in June). Both would work just fine, and would let you capitalize on the value prospects of this play.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you\u2019re just looking for a nice stock to buy and hold, grab some shares, wait for the inevitable runup post Russel inclusion, and sell some covered calls once the premiums start to get jacked to the tits. You\u2019ll amplify your returns, while reaping the benefits of organic stock appreciation.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Bear Thesis\n\nAlongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I\u2019m no better than a pump-and-dumper. Below, you can find a list of potential negatives related to UWMC, with respect to the various investing timelines discussed above.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Swing**\n\n- RKT can grind to a halt, killing all momentum within the sector, similar to how GME took out the other meme stocks when it popped.\n- Russel inclusion doesn\u2019t drive up the price nearly as much as anticipated, resulting in little change in the underlying's price.\n- Stock and option pricing sometimes drops post dividend - pay close attention to March 9th.\n- Although uncommon, the low float may result in potential manipulation from MMs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Deep Value**\n\n- Mortgage industry faces potential insecurity, as the promise of 0% interest rates may be extended all the way until the end of 2022\n- Mortgage companies are not \u201csexy\u201d. In a market dominated by innovation and tech, investors may be reluctant to invest their money in a \u201cboring mortgage company\u201d.\n- Insiders are allowed to sell in 6 months time. Luckily, the CEO of UWMC owns 90% of the company, and has been adamant that company will prove itself to be worth analyst's valuation of at least $14.50 - Take this with a grain of salt.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Long Term Prospects**\n\n- An upcoming market or housing crash could potentially result in this sector being hit harder than the others. This is an extremely unlikely scenario, as we will likely have far bigger problems than UWMC dropping 2$ back down to 7$, but still one to consider nonetheless.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nAll in all, amidst the RKT madness, UWMC seems to provide us with an awesome trading opportunity. With different trades applicable to three distinct investing styles, UWMC offers the potential for everyone to make some coin. If you want to capitalize off of the RKT pump and index inclusion, you can look to swing trade with some cheap option contracts. If you\u2019ve done your due diligence, and like what you see on UWMC\u2019s balance sheet, you can take a deep value approach and mimic the methods of our king. Lastly, if you\u2019re just a boring ass boomer, you can grab some shares and enjoy the gain train. If you enjoyed the DD, feel free to follow me on twitter, or join my investing discord.

        "selftext": "$**UWMC** Has been seeing a lot of inflow over the last few days. There are also a few elements that we need to consider.\n\n**1. Inclusion into the Russell 1000 and 3000**\n\n2. New product launch / relaunch\n\n3. Current price\n\n4. Current interest and large options buys\n\nAfter going over some of the financial statements, earlier investor presentations I can clearly see why this is such an attractive buy. Robert Verdun recently made a purchase of common stock at $7.97 per share on March 1st 2021, which tells us that insiders currently think the stock is undervalued at its current valuation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e31a7mx67xk61.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1554e8b94f254884018685e65822110c87b48d35\n\nFrom an earlier presentation we also established that UWMC, which is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 7.28 is undervalued in comparison to it\u2019s peers. On that alone, we are bullish with a base target of $12, which is above the current price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ex2qsud87xk61.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8ff64cdeeab847fb1aa82d6fb9307d06e11945\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzt6j9k97xk61.png?width=586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ef3f49aea8a6e710d6d6421032de2c44da51d41\n\nFurthermore, UWMC has been seeing constant growth, which was further accelerated due to Covid-19 and the high housing demand.\n\nPer the last statement, we can see that UWMC growth which was also highlighted in earlier presentations. A strengthening balance sheet with a large increase in closed loan volume.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzqlk5ha7xk61.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9039e70958cc60a5e88ac9703623c2834a74dfc6\n\nAlso, UWMC\n\nTodays price action in my opinion reflected people anxious to get out, that have been trapped for a while. After UWMC consolidates, I suspect we will see another move.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gnwkk2eb7xk61.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b62fb83c78ce613996f470bbffcfed1afb002fa9\n\nContracts traded at the ASK, indicates bullishness. Also, the Call / Put ratio indicates that UWMC is VERY BULLISH.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ccoh1gvb7xk61.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a93dab0577ad191902ace76ceb2d2ec50ef64a49\n\nBig order flow:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzt2o3gc7xk61.png?width=1175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19fb69b0d0271404c1ff2d6424c72c8cabd47a5f\n\nGamma indicates potential move to $9 on downside, and $15 on upside, very good Risk reward on the setup. The inclusion could tip this easily to the upside, so could any shorts covering.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7snr0dd7xk61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6135037e027d48abbaf5d3f833433ad7925b2983\n\nShares available to borrow for short, was over 1million on 03/03. At the end of day, now sitting at under 100k shares available to short and a borrow fee that has increased.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3f0h4ge7xk61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e24f50e482b85db4b898e877dc41c82056e107d6\n\nHedge funds have been adding calls per the recent 13F filings\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/99xl6epg7xk61.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c6bc83f47579af4448fba57da79424e59b767f3\n\nSo all of this to say, UWMC is a good buy right now, especially with the market trading sideways. I currently have a position from under $8 and will continue to add on daily dips. Consider adding if you are not in already. The run is just starting in my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther information, UWMC is more efficient than it's peers, including RKT.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8h1qzeuh7xk61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1f5a132a8b87658e09599be1ee80a99e4b99646",

        "selftext": "Robinhood is lending your shares to shorters. Don't believe me? \n\nHow's about this, from Reuters, yesterday: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-robinhood-securitiesle-idUSKCN2AU2EP\n\nBut you have margin turned off! But you have a sell limit set for $69,420.69! IT DOESN'T MATTER. \n\nINSTANT SETTLEMENTS is what needs to be TURNED OFF. They even hide it away, under profile&gt;menu&gt;investing&gt;DAY TRADE SETTINGS. \n\nOn top of that, THEY DO NOT LET YOU TURN IT OFF IF YOU HAVE ANY PENDING DEPOSITS OR HAVE TRADED IN THE LAST 3 DAYS. \n\nThat's the cost of instant settlements. Sure, you get to trade quicker, but you also allow them to trade AGAINST you, and WITH YOUR OWN SHARES.\n\nCan't turn off instant settlements, don't want to be stuck in limbo for a full brokerage transfer, and determined to escape? What can be done?\n\nWell, my fellow smooth-brained ape, I'll tell you what I'm doing:\n\nThe following steps assume you are invested primarily in shares of a company, not options. EACH OF THESE STEPS WILL TAKE TIME TO PROCESS, SO PLAN ACCORDINGLY.\n\nFirst, open an account at a different brokerage. Make sure it's a cash-account (for some brokerages, like WeBull, etc., YOU MUST OPT-OUT OF SHARE LENDING). With a cash-account, you'll have to sit patiently for settlement of funds from selling shares before you can withdraw those funds or reinvest (but, let's be honest, you wouldn't be reading this if you weren't already patient). I use Fidelity, which is a cash-account by default with several opt-in programs to take advantage of down the line. \n\nSecond, IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, transfer/deposit money into your new brokerage from your bank (or wherever else you usually get your money to trade with). If GME is your sole play, and you can afford it, try to deposit around the same amount your GME shares in Robinhood are currently worth. \n\nOnce your deposit is completed (no longer \"pending\"), wait for a small dip in the price and buy in with your new broker. \n\nWhen the purchase is complete, you can go into Robinhood and sell your shares (ideally, at the same or slightly higher price than you just bought them for at your new brokerage).\n\nWait out the next few trading days of your Robinhood account and DO NOT TRADE VIA ROBINHOOD. If you trade, you risk resetting the clock on your Withdrawable Cash. You do your trading with your new brokerage from now on. Withdraw your cash from Robinhood ASAP and put it back in your bank account, pay back your wife's boyfriend, or whatever.\n\nNow, if Robinhood wants to keep any short deals they had on your shares, THEY have to hold onto the shares, themselves. Every 1 share you were holding away from shorters (ineffectively), has now become 2 shares (1 effectively, 1 ineffectively). That, or Robinhood actually does sell the shares, which increases the length of the short chain and the costs associated with holding that position.. Thus, shorting attempts are made more expensive and less sustainable. \n\nMeanwhile, you'll be back to holding your shares without your broker selling them behind your back. \n\nTLDR: Don't let your diamond hands be sold by the pawn shop that's storing them. Getting out of Robinhood not only helps you, but also hinders the shorts. Two birds with one stone. Power to the players.\n\nObligatory, not financial advice, not an adviser or professional, do your own research, yadayada. \n\nIf I'm wrong about anything in the above, do not be surprised, but please let me know what it might be. If my foundation is rotted, please kick my case over before anyone even considers moving in. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "I'm generally a long investor and have been in the market for a couple years now. I've realized that some stocks were way overvalued \u00e0 few weeks ago. Yesterday morning I took a short position on Zoom (ZM), 50 shares @ 427. I've always been turned off by the idea of shorting because losses are theoretically infinite but the stock is so overvalued and after thorough research by myself I finally decided to put money on it. (not financial advice) \n\nAs I predicted, it went down, but way more than I expected, and at $340 I bought the shares back to close out the position. Although the gains aren't much, and this aspect of trading is new to me, I am pleased with my research. I'm gonna stick with long trading for the time being, because shorting is still a sketchy tactic which, I'll be honest, still kinda spooks me\n\n**Edit: For everyone saying I should've gotten put options:**\n\n1) You're right, and I realize that now, in hindsight\n\n2) I honestly didn't expect it to tank this quickly. Logic deemed it would but I expected it'd be over the course of weeks, not hours. The tolerance I had given myself (in case the price went up by a certain amount), would in essence be the same as the premium on an option, and\n\n3) I'm not very experienced in options trading, other than selling CC's on my own shares",

(side note, I\u2019d be interested to know if they\u2019re trying to compete with twitch here too)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA newer expansion on Spotify\u2019s part is their recent foray into audiobooks. It appears that they\u2019re sticking to public domain works for now to test the waters, but moving forwards, this could create a real challenge to competitors like Audible, a company with an estimated $2.5B in revenue in 2020 and no real competitors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify\u2019s been aggressively pursuing developing markets**, which has a negative impact on financials in the short term but could lead to greater profitability in the future.  The reason is that they charge lower rates in developing markets in order to build a subscriber base and a presence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnto some quick financial stats. (figures in EUR) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify\u2019s 2020 revenue clocks in at 7.3B, and a 47.7B mkt cap, which works out to a P/S ratio of 6.53.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I like to value companies in the context of competitors \u2026 which is sort of hard to do for spotify. I\u2019d argue Netflix is the most comparable (software, digital media, subscriber model), and their P/S ratio sits at 8.96. Twitter\u2019s a bit of a stretch, but their P/S ratio sits at 13.5: Adobe, another stretch but closer imo as it\u2019s subscription-based software, sits at 15.9.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify\u2019s debt/equity ratio is on a downward trend, sitting at 1.26. It\u2019s got a forwards CAGR of 22%.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe biggest red flag I see on their balance sheet has to do with their **cost of revenue: it\u2019s been increasing almost in lock-step with revenue. Spotify\u2019s very close to being profitable, and they\u2019ve posted a profit for some quarters (though never a full year).** Spotify\u2019s under good management, however, and I\u2019m confident that once their more aggressive expansions mature, profit will follow, especially as they\u2019ve proved they can stave off competitors like Apple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a valuation play alone, I\u2019d argue Spotify is better suited to a **P/S of at least NFLX,** which would place it at **$375/sh**. With growth taken into account -- that the firm is estimated to grow at 22%, and is well-positioned globally against competitors -- I\u2019d argue a more accurate P/S would place it **closer to 10 P/S**, putting SPOT at **$418/sh**. ^((these P/S ratios are gargantuan, but that\u2019s true for the tech sector in general; my argument is that spotify\u2019s undervalued in the context of the current market.))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t really do deep dives into companies this much, so let me know where I might\u2019ve gone wrong in analyzing the company (especially if I missed something in the balance sheet).",

AMC increased its share count from roughly 100m to 450m in the last few month alone.\n\nThis is a link to AMC latest quarterly release:\n\n[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0a2146ef-7cb0-43b1-b96f-33c1681e146e.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dilution events taken from latest 8K](https://preview.redd.it/5nhq36y0edm61.png?width=904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afb291e963b75de557dcfaafd9d87c951ff24211)\n\n**Lets count just how many shares have been issued:**\n\nFrom the above picture: 15+15+20+200+50+44.4 = 344.4 . this compares to a starting share count of 103.8m so total shares out is now 448m (and that does not include all the restricted stock options management issued to themselves)\n\nWhich I estimate is another 6m.\n\n\uf0e8 Bottom line share count went up by 4.5x\n\n\uf0e8 And this is all float.. no institutional holders.. (Wanda converted there B shares to A shares to sell them)\n\n# 2. Furthermore the company will keep issuing more shares.\n\nThey have another 70m left to issue which will likely be issues in the next days to come.\n\nAnd \u2026 here it comes:\n\nThe company just filed an Annul general meeting to increase the share count by another 500m.\n\nSee this link:\n\n[http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/9f348412-ec88-4159-a092-631da0404d66.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMC filing to do another 500m shares](https://preview.redd.it/wul8zvh3edm61.png?width=904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c73a842dfabc32da7b9491a837069132414a7baf)\n\n# Operationally it\u2019s a severely struggling business:\n\n\\- The company burned through 125m a month in Q4\n\n\\- That burn will step up to 150m per month in H2 as management has stated at yday call.\n\n\\- They have 1bn of cash on hand but that will go down fast\n\n\\- Debt is now higher then pre corona and there is another 450m of unpaid rent\n\n\\- Share count is 4.5 pre covid .. so today\u2019s share price really means around 48USD compred to pre covid dilution \u2013 pre covid it was trading at 6-8USD\n\n\\- Remember AMC wasn\u2019t even able to generate any cash pre- covid\n\n\\- The stock rally has saved the debt holders because AMC might indeed be able to avoid bankruptcy.. but given the dilution the stock is still effectively worthless\n\nThere is not even that much squeeze potential:\n\n# Lets look at the facts:\n\n# 1. Stocks shorted 55.5m ??\n\nThat is a whopping ;) 12.3% of float\u2026.

But what about a gamma squeeze ???\n\nAgain lets look at the facts.\n\nThe open interest in all calls is 1.27m .. against that we have 0.684m puts.\n\nLets totally ignore the puts which have a stable effect on the share price.. lets assume those don\u2019t exist.\n\n1.27m calls are equivalent to still a high number of 127m shares\u2026\n\nMany of these calls are out of the money..\n\nBut hey let's assume ALL the calls end up in the money.\n\nThat is 127m shares.. add that to the 55m shorted and you end up at 237m .. which is still only 50% of float!!\n\nAlso this compares to 1!!!!! Daily volume.. far from critical.\n\nMore realistically assuming a 30% delta and 50% put offset its more an extra 17m shares from calls.\n\nThis is not going to the moon.. The fundamentals are not there.\n\nThe reason why dildos get exited is that they look at outdated statistics about the shares outstanding and think it is sooo highly shorted.. but the fact is it isn\u2019t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lz5zqgi8edm61.png?width=904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c528206d8ff289937b709421c10eeb4114a63ec9\n\nlook at open interest.. taken from bloomberg\n\n# Concluding Remarks:\n\nNow go on and downvote..

        "selftext": "I've seen a lot of misunderstanding across about the effect of rates on equities, so I figure I'd hop off of WSB to give an explainer about the relationship between stocks and interest rates, and show why the current sell off makes sense.\n\n**Where do interest rates come from?**\n\nMoney has time value. Money today is usually worth more today than money tomorrow. How do we measure the time value of money? Interest! When we loan money out, we demand a return. What goes into an interest rate? There are 3 primary factors:\n\n1. \\*What do I think inflation is going to be?\\*Say you estimate inflation to be 3% and rising, you'll demand a far higher interest rate to protect yourself.\n2. \\*How risky is this loan?\\*Your lend to a group of risky businesses, you might jack up interest rates to make sure if one goes under, you'll make your money back from the rest\n3. \\*How much is everyone else willing to lend for?\\*You'll need to compete with other lenders which helps determine the final interest rate.\n\n**US Treasuries: King of Bonds**\n\nSo US government debt is considered primo with near 0 risk of default. The rates on US government debt determines whats known as the *risk free rate*.\n\nThe US issues debt at several different maturities from weeks, to months, to years. If we line up these interest rates, we get what is known as the [yield curve](https://www.gurufocus.com/yield_curve.php).\n\nTo reiterate, these rates are determined by the market and are manipulated by the Federal Reserve, which attempts to intervene in the market to get rates to its targets. When the Fed comes out and says it wants rates to stay near zero, this one of the ways they do it.\n\nAnd this is exactly what happened during the corona crash, interest rates went to zero across the curve.\n\n**How to Value a Company**\n\nLet's say we have two companies. $BRR and $GRO. Let's say we're certain of their future cash flows.\n\n* BRR is runs a money printer and makes $10M a year.\n* GRO is a growth stock that's expected to make $100M a year in a decade.\n\nHow do we value these two companies based on cash flow alone? For simplicity, let's only look at the first 10 years. We need to determine the present value of the money the company makes in the future.\n\nWhat is money from n years from now worth today?  money / (1 + risk\\_free\\_rate)\\^n. So we can represent todays value for 10 years of cash flow like this:\n\nLet $$$ Year X be the money we *know for sure* (i.e. the certainty equivalent) the company will make in year X. Let r be the risk free rate. Then we can model the value of the company roughly as follows:\n\nValue = ($$$ Year 1) / (1 + r) + ... + ($$$ Year 10) / (1 + r)\\^10\n\n**How Rates Affect Value**\n\nSo which company do you think is worth more? BRR or GRO.\n\nWell that depends on the interest rate! Let's say interest rates are at 0 or near zero. Their valuations taking no other factors into account are nearly the same: $100M.\n\nNow let's start cranking up the interest rate slowly to see what the current valuation is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|r|BRR|GRO|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0.0%|100M|100M|\n|0.5%|97M|95M|\n|1.0%|94M|90M|\n|2.0%|90M|82M|\n|4.0%|81M|67M|\n\n***As interest rates go up, the company that depends more on future earnings (GRO) is getting whacked. A move 0% to 2% knocks off almost 20% in one shot.***\n\n*SPECIAL NOTE: The risk free rate is actually extremely low right now, around 0.05% due to Fed intervention. With the move in the 5 and 10 year, the market is likely anticipating an acceleration much sooner than expected.*\n\n**So why the fuss all of a sudden?**\n\nStocks went flying higher under the assumption that the fed would remain dovish, work to keep interest rates low, and would not be able to produce inflation over 2% if it wanted to. For a lot of reasons, people were betting that if that inflation would appear any were it would happen farther out in time near the 30Y. Given they figured the 5Y would stay low, and the 30Y would go high they shorted the 30Y bonds and went long 5Y. However, 5Y and 10Y treasury yields suddenly spiked making everyone ask whether inflation would come sooner and faster. People hoped the fed wold say something to alleviate this, but instead Powell had stated in September that he's fine [with inflation running hot over 2%](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/09/02/what-do-changes-in-the-feds-longer-run-goals-and-monetary-strategy-statement-mean/)  (which no one seems to have believed) , and the fed today reiterated its not going to do anything about it in the short run. Hence, yields are still rising and equities are continuing to fall.  Add to this all the froth and speculation, a 20-30% correction makes a lot of sense in overheated names.\n\n**Caveats about the analysis above**\n\n1. The interest rates are made up. In reality, the risk free rate is a lot lower. The true risk free rate, for example, is typically associated with 3 month bills \\~0.05%, at 10 years that yields (1.005)\\^10 = 1.05%.\n2. Equity risk premium is also another factor.\n3. BRR is actually a better play since the risk free rate for earlier years will likely be lower than those farther out in time.\n4. You shouldn't stop counting after year 10. You in theory can go out to infinity, and if rates are near zero, valuations for a growth company blow up too.\n5. In most discount cashflow analysis, you don't use the risk free rate instead you use a discount rate specific to the company that takes risk into account for that company. In this case, it's fine to use the risk free rate since we assume we somehow know exactly how much the company will make (certainty equivalent). In the real world, we predict future cash flows by licking a finger sticking it in the air, and guessing which way the wind will blow.\n\n**Inflation! Waddabout gold?**\n\nIf treasury yields stay above inflation, gold prices fall. That's because it's better to own a sheet of paper with a yield than a rock. Gold will only benefit if the Fed works to suppress rates farther out on the curve.  This is why [the price of gold is negatively correlated with real interest rates](https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/gold-interest-rates/)*.*",

Meanwhile, there's half a pandemic going on in the country because at least 14 states are planning to reopen. At the same time Congress wants to borrow a bloated $1.9 Trillion budget to splurge on hookers and blow.\n\nHappy times are here again...\n\nUnfortunately, the fundamentals of companies are starting to solidify and they don't need the easy money with the economy reopening. The economy has a government spending hangover and wants interest prices to increase before hyperinflation appears.\n\nHowever, Government promised a whole lotta freebies during the election and now people have turned up with pockets turned out waiting for their share.\n\nThe Fed decides it's not going to raise interest rates but fundamentals don't give a damn. Buyers don't want to buy worthless bonds and the government \"prints\" money by issuing bonds.\n\nA classic catch-22...\n\nCongress can't borrow $1.9 Trillion unless the Treasury issues more bonds. Investors won't buy the bonds unless the interest rate increases. If interest rates increase it becomes more expensive for everybody to borrow.\n\nBasically...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0n9cfhbeg2l61.gif\n\nThe yield bonds are increasing on their own because of all the inflation stuffed into the market over the past year. All the hedge funds who shorted GME and AMC are now in trouble. All their borrowed shares just got more expensive to hold and there's nothing they can do about it.\n\nMy hunch is today's sell off is a desperate money grab to try to keep the GME price down to keep their interest down. (At the time of writing this GME is rising)\n\nBefore they were slowly bleeding out money. Now they've nicked an artery it's gushing out.\n\nTL;DR Raising bond yields means hedge funds have to pay more in interest to borrow stocks and they're doing a fire sale to cover their bets.\n\nedit: I can't spell.\n\nedit 2: The treasury issues bonds, not the fed. I was confused because Janet Yellen is everywhere. First at the fed, then in Citadel's pocket, now at the treasury. My bad.\n\nedit 3: Thanks for all the awards.

        "selftext": "I've been building a position in United Wholesale Mortgage ($UWMC) for months now since their merger was announced and with these prices I decided to offer some DD to any members of this sub with the ability to hold more than one stonk in their portfolio.\n\n**TLDR: UWMC is better than RKT and I think it's better for both the short-term traders and the long-hold investors.**\n\nI have read a lot of great analysis of their financials all over Reddit recently so I won't bore with too many details but the high altitude view goes as follows:\n\n* Went public with a $16B valuation based on ONLY three quarters of 2020 (9.5X multiple on adjusted income)\n* In Q3 2020 alone they did $1.45B in net income (which means their Q4 reporting towards the end of April is going to be massive!)\n* At today's price the dividend yield is over 4% annually!  Ex-dividend date is this coming Tuesday, meaning if you're going to buy do it BEFORE Tuesday March 9th\n* It was announced this week they'll be included in the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 Index beginning March 22nd which means EXTRA buying necessity between now and earnings\n\n**For the semi-retarded members here this means tons of net buying between now and March 22nd because of INDEX INCLUSION, DIVIDEND BONUS, and EARNINGS RUN-UP!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, as a realtor I'd like to add some professional analysis here and I'll touch on RKT briefly too because they're being compared a lot due to sector similarity but their models are totally different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. It doesn't matter what mortgage rates are, mortgage originators always make X% margin on every loan they sell. **What matters is the number of purchases and refi's (ie how many widgets they sell)** Nationwide there is a MASSIVE shortage of housing supply because people are simply not moving which means when things return to \"normal\" we'll see 1X, 2X, 5x, and in some markets even 10X the number of homes being sold which translates to the same number of new loans being originated.  **Profits are way higher on new purchases vs. refi's so while nobody is turning refi's down their marketing dollars are spent generating loans on new purchases.**  Anybody who tuned in to UWMC's final sales call of 2020 for their national reps heard their **CEO Matt Ishba talking about how they'd spend the money they'd get from going public and he was all about RELATIONSHIPS**.  Relationships with realtors particularly but also with other real estate spheres in influence (insurance agents, title companies, etc)\n2. **RKT has great market share but realtors hate when clients consider using them because they frequently take way longer to close a loan** than what is considered normal (3-4 weeks right now). Originators like the salespeople working through UWMC have a major competitive advantage against Rocket and others because they close deals fast! That is all that matters to realtors and realtors are often the person that is pointing people in the direction of the lending option.  **RKT may get a lot of market share for refi's (the lower profitability loans) but UWMC is poised to get a growing share of higher profit new purchase volume**, especially as supply of homes for sale (new and pre-owned) increases to meet demand).\n\nNow, anybody who has either considered selling a home recently or buying a home recently knows this but for those not in those categories the real estate market is insane right now!  Think \"*Melvin Capital scrounging for GME shares to cover their shorts in the biggest gamma squeeze cycle ever*\" insane!  Mediocre homes are selling for over asking price within days of hitting the market and buyers are FOMO'ing hardcore into paying these escalating prices.  ***That's a great thing for sellers but doesn't do anything good or bad for UWMC holders.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THIS IS WHAT MATTERS FOR UWMC INVESTORS:**\n\n**As inventory increases** (*which it will because in some states Covid made it near impossible to sell*) in 2021 **and as prices become to normalize** (*causing more people to want to move because it won't be insanely expensive on the buy side*) **the volume of high profit loans for new purchases will increase**.  Again, it doesn't matter if interest rates go up a little, it's not like they're going to double.  Interest rates are at all time lows [as seen here from Freddie Mac](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html) and that isn't going to change for years to come.\n\nUWMC pays a regular dividend, is about to announce an insane Q4 on or around April 23rd, and since they're the largest originator of loans in the country they will absolutely see a rising price moving forward into 2021.\n\n**Short-Term Traders:** Best bet for you is to buy slightly OTM April or May calls.  Personally I'd buy May calls but with the intention of selling them during the earnings run-up (if that happens) and/or holding them through ER if the run-up isn't significant enough due to the market's overall vibe right now.  Buying May calls gives you extra insurance which I like but degens should stick to April and save the premim.\n\n**Long Term Investors:** At current prices (between $9-10/share today) if you're not buying now than there is no helping you.  I've bought at levels as low as $9 and as high as $12 and I'm comfortable anywhere in that range.  I don't think a price of $16-18 by year's end is unreasonable once the company has steady quarterly growth figures for bigger investors to buy in with.  I believe we'll see over $20/share only if the market as a whole starts humming along and only if local home sale inventory returns to 2019 levels and I'd guesstimate that is 50/50 shot.\n\n**TLDR Again: Tons of net buying between now and March 22nd because of INDEX INCLUSION, DIVIDEND BONUS, and EARNINGS RUN-UP in April!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Proof of my 10,000 share position**:  [https://imgur.com/B65AGW9](https://imgur.com/B65AGW9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Buy Orders Today Are Set:**\n\n* 1,000 shares @ $8.71 (filled)\n* 1,000 shares @ $8.61 (filled)\n* 1,000 shares @ $8.51\n* 1,000 shares @ $8.41\n* 1,000 shares @ $8.31\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Again, this is just the bull thesis.**  I think a few decent bearish points have been made elsewhere that I can get behind but most have to deal with mortgages being unsexy or the company being young and untested.  Well....\n\n1. Making money is sexy to me, I don't know about you fruits\n2. Most of the members here are young and untested too, probably spreading STI's all over your local areas via Grinder before Covid\n\n**Good luck to all, happy trading, and let's expand our horizons a little like the old days of WSB.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1:** u/ElSanDavid was kind enough to point out below that a director recently bought 60,000 shares on March 1st and the average analyst rating is $12.50.\n\nEdit 2: Adding this [amazing article](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2021/03/04/united-wholesale-mortgage-ultimatum-rocket-companies/4578357001/) where the CEO of UWM, Matt Ishbia, walked into the room for his Facebook Live broadcast to UWM's brokers, unzipped his pants, whipped his thing out, smacked them around a little bit, and zipped back up and dropped the mic.  **TLDR: He told UWM loan officers that effective Mid-March they must decide whether they'll keep working with Rocket OR United Wholesale Mortgage because working with both would no longer be an option (this will hurt RKT, not UWMC).**",

        "selftext": "First off. Lmao. Cant tell you how many times I\u2019ve been called a \u201cboomer\u201d for avoiding TSLA and NIO. For the people that are still holding on, good on you.....but the people panicked and selling at a loss, yikes. \n\nIt\u2019s times like this where we learn the most about ourselves. \n\n- Ask yourself what you\u2019ve learned about your risk tolerance. \n\n- Ask yourself what lessons you\u2019ve learned about the reason why you are investing and buying companies. \n\nWhen the market goes down or one of my holdings tank. I am often reminded of Peter Lynch. He says that when you buy a company because the returns are good, when the stock goes down people don\u2019t know what to do and sell. I feel like this is a lot of y\u2019all. Y\u2019all bought TSLA and NIO in hopes of 7xing your money...but now that TSLA is down 25% from its ATH, and NIO is down 33%; y\u2019all don\u2019t know what to do, so you panic and then sell. \n\nAbout a month ago, I found this article by Financial Samurai \n\nhttps://www.financialsamurai.com/risk-tolerance-is-difficult-to-measure/\n\nI think he shares an important lesson/warning about investing. Your perceived risk tolerance is an illusion. The truth is, most of y\u2019all (including myself) have never experienced major crashes. I know a good chunk of y\u2019all probably started in 2020 and only experienced 2020 style returns, let me tell you that isn\u2019t normal. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to say \u201cbuy and hold forever!!!\u201d And I assume most, if not all of you say that because it\u2019s common advice and common sense, however we all have a plan until SHTF as the saying goes. \n\nIt\u2019s important to keep a level head when it comes to investing. Buffett always preaches that investing doesn\u2019t take smarts, it takes guts. You can put all your money into VOO and have good returns, but if you can\u2019t stomach crashes/corrections and sell, then you won\u2019t make money. \n\nPersonal way of dealing with this: \n\nWhen it comes to volatility, I\u2019ve experienced some large 20% plus drops in prices and have held on. It\u2019s hard but I\u2019ve held on and bought more during those dips because I believe in what I\u2019m buying and know why I am buying it. I\u2019ve done my DD over the companies I\u2019m in and that gives me the confidence I need to keep going. What helps me, is not looking. I\u2019ll delete the app or turn off my computer and make myself busy. This helped me the most last spring, I used to watch it like a hawk when things would dip and I\u2019d start to panic and think about selling. When I turn it off, that impulse goes away some. What also helped me was, before I buy anything I write down on a Word Doc, why I\u2019m buying it; and before I sell, I write down and explain what factors changed that makes me need to sell the stock, if nothing changed, I know I\u2019m being irrational and I need to buy the dip. \n\nSo these are just my observations. Not professional financial advice but the tips are what I personally do.",

        "selftext": "Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors (ASO) is criminally undervalued and flying under the radar right now. It beat last quarter\u2019s earnings by 2.4x predictions, and upcoming earnings will be the catalyst needed to make ASO skyrocket. Guns are a major part of their sales, and January 2021 had the 3rd highest single-month gun sales recorded in US history.\n\n\\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n**Fundamental Analysis:**\n\n**Gun Sales**\n\nAcademy Sports and Outdoors is focused on selling hunting, fishing, and camping equipment. A major point of interest in this company is its gun sales. So long as ASO continues to go down the path of marketing and selling guns, they will continue to grow, especially in todays climate. Gun sales are up in January from previous months, with the third-highest monthly total of gun sales on record ([Gun sales surged 80 percent in January, data shows - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gun-sales-january-background-checks/)). On top of that, the number of NICS Firearm Background Checks is up 30.53% from last year\u2019s monthly average, from 3,307,943 background checks per month in 2020 to 4,317,804 in January 2021 ([NICS Firearm Checks: Month/Year \u2014 FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view)).\n\nCEO Ken Hicks claims that many people picked up new hobbies such as hunting, fishing, and camping, which has helped drive sales. And if only 20-30% of those people continue with those hobbies, it will greatly help their sales ([Academy Sports CEO says hobbies acquired during COVID will continue to drive sales in 2021 - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/academy-sports-ceo-says-hobbies-acquired-during-covid-will-continue-to-drive-sales-in-2021-11608054715)). Especially if many are scared of future potential gun restrictions created by the Democrat-controlled Congress, now could be a time where we see a surge of gun purchases before any restrictions are made, which would drive ASO sales.\n\nLocation-wise, ASO is in the perfect position to continue making sales year-round. Located in the South, people can continue their outdoor activities throughout the winter, providing ASO with sales when it may not otherwise have been able to if it were located further north.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**IPO and Leadership**\n\nIn 2011, KKR bought out ASO, however, ASO recently went public on October 2, 2020. Led by CEO Ken Hicks, ASO is well-positioned to continue boosting its sales. As CEO at Foot Locker, Hicks helped reverse three years of negative same-store sales, and he brings his experience in other executive positions to the table ([Academy Sports + Outdoors Announces Ken C. Hicks as Chairman and CEO - ASO](http://corporate.academy.com/academy-sports-outdoors-announces-ken-c-hicks-as-chairman-and-ceo/index.html)).\n\nASO is clearly focused on growth, rather than maintenance. Effective Jan 29, 2021, ASO eliminated the COO position at ASO \u201cin order to create a more efficient operating structure and focus on key strategic priorities\u201d ([Academy Sports eliminates COO role - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/academy-sports-eliminates-coo-role-2021-01-21)). It is focused on increasing its efficiency and sales. This is also indicated by the fact that it just went public, meaning it intends to use the money gained from its public offering to help grow the company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stimulus Bill**\n\nThe $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that was passed by the House on Feb 2, 2021, would be a huge boost to the company if it were to pass the Senate. This is not exclusive to ASO, but it would help the overall economy, and give more disposable income for people to spend, and help boost sales.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Financials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14d-1TgdKxr_Bz1f3yDdQ6Uclt04MxzXJivPQmDEUirw/edit?usp=sharing) **(obtained from Yahoo Finance; click title for link to spreadsheet)**\n\nThis is a key part of my valuation of ASO. It displays how criminally undervalued ASO is a company relative to the market as a whole, as well as its competitors. I have linked a google spreadsheet to this post that shows several key indicators as to why ASO is undervalued relative to its competitors. I will compare ASO\u2019s financials to Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, as they are the most similar competitor.\n\nASO\u2019s trailing P/E ratio is currently 10.82, as compared to DKS\u2019 17.56\n\nASO\u2019s forward P/E is 9.78, as compared to DKS\u2019 14.9\n\nASO\u2019s P/S (ttm) is 0.41, as compared to DKS\u2019 0.74\n\nASO\u2019s P/B (mrq) is 2.29, as compared to DKS\u2019 3.15\n\nAdditionally, its most recent actual earnings (0.91 eps) were 2.4x its predicted earnings (0.39 eps), and its predicted earnings for next quarter are 0.48 eps, still well below last quarters earnings ([ASO 23.96 -0.78 -3.13% : Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASO?p=ASO)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Debt**\n\nASO\u2019s debt is one of their few worrisome financial indicators. They have a great deal of debt, with their debt to equity ratio sitting at 272.59 (as compared to DKS\u2019 150.66). However, ASO has already designated around $200 million obtained from their IPO to help pay off some debt ([Is This Retail IPO a Winner? | The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/17/is-this-retail-ipo-a-winner/)). They also have the ability to pay off short-term debt, so I do not see this as a company that will likely go bankrupt. Their current ratio (mrq) is 1.61 and although this is significantly lower than many other gun-related companies, it is actually lower than DKS\u2019 1.4, which shows that they do in fact have the ability to show off their short-term debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Short Interest**\n\nWhile I am not a fan of solely using short interest as an indicator to invest in a stock, it can still be a helpful tool. According to [S3 Research](https://www.shortsight.com/category/s3-research/), ASO\u2019s short interest as a percentage of its float is 28.18%, as compared to DKS\u2019 14.97%. Both of these are fairly high, and show that there is great short interest against both these companies. Although I strongly believe that there will not be a sudden short squeeze, over time I believe that sustained stock price growth will force investors to cover their short positions, and will definitely help fuel ASO\u2019s stock price growth.\n\n\\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nASO has been following a strict channel since its IPO in October as seen below. It has bounced off support and resistance multiple times, but still remains in this channel. ASO is currently hitting the bottom of the channel, and I believe it will soon bounce back.

For charting, I use TD Ameritrade's Thinkorswim.\n\n2.) I have noticed multiple people questioning ASO because it is nearing its ATH. Just because it is nearing its ATH does not mean that it cannot go higher. I do not believe that its old ATH is an accurate valuation of the company, and so I believe it will break through that price. As u/uncowisdo pointed out in the comments, Amazon's ATH was $70 at one point. \n\n3.) Someone also asked why I have 3/19 and 4/16 calls if my target price of $30 is dated 5/1. This is because I bought them before I knew the earnings report date (and I still don't believe they have officially announced it as 4/8 yet). Also, their costs were relatively low compared to the potential upside. And being the retard that I am, I only know how to buy and not sell, so I will be holding onto them.",

        "selftext": "Hello WSB, this is my first official post, but I'm very proud to see how we have all HODL together really strong.\n\nI have been in GME since 30 Oct 2019 with an additional 1670 shares on 29 May 2020 and I wish I could take a screenshot to prove my words, but my custodian account does not allow any screenshots out of \"security\" reasons. I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.\n\nThat being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.\n\nThere's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.\n\nI'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.\n\n\u201cIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\u201d\n\nTruth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.\n\nAnd let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.\n\nSo what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.\n\nNot just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! \n\nYou know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.\n\nBased on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.\n\nFellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.\n\nNow... We strike back, by doing NOTHING!",

        "selftext": "Preface: GME Apes hold on to GME with your diamond hands, this is not a ploy to get you to sell nor is this post for you. This entertainment, not financial advice. This is just a \ud83c\udff3\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b look into the bond market and why you are seeing red and will continue to. TLDR first so anyone interested in taking a trip into the bearcave and coming out the closet on the other side can understand what's happening.\n\nTL,DR: The fed is no longer in control of interest rates. Stocks are artificially inflated due to the Fed injecting money into the economy with nowhere for it to go but to investments, with stocks offering the highest returns of all possible investments. This used to not be an issue as the Fed was in control of how much QE could be done through open market operations as they were the buyers, but as the money supply is now enormous coupled with rising money velocity, the Fed will now have no choice but to start the process of QT, but to do that they need to sell bonds, which they are struggling to do due to low interest rates. To sell more bonds to reduce the money supply they will have to increase interest rates, resulting in a sea of red and the\ud83c\udff3\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b's taking a trip to tendietown.\n\nPart 1: Macro 101 review:\n\nIf you are comfortable with macroeconomic concepts, feel free to skip this part. This section is just definitions for the retards on the short bus that flunked out of econ.\n\nFor this DD we will need to understand the concepts of money supply, money velocity, open market operations, QE, and QT. Money supply is the total amount of money in the economy. Money velocity tells us how fast money is changing hands through the economy. More info at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money\\_supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity\\_of\\_money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money)\n\nOpen market operations refers to the Fed purchasing or selling securities on the open market, which is one of three monetary tools the Fed has at its disposal, with the other two being the discount rate and reserve requirement which are not important for this DD. QE and QT refer to quantitative easing/tightening, which is where the fed performs open market operations to either increase or decrease the supply of money in the economy.\n\nPart 2: What's been happening so far:\n\nNow that we have let the retards off the short bus, lets discuss where we are right now at a macroeconomic scale and how we got here. I want to get to what is happening with the bonds and I will try to keep this as short as possible.\n\nAs we all know, the Fed has been printing money like crazy since last year, with JPow money machine go brrrr. As a result, the money supply has gone through the roof since the pandemic hit, which we can see below in the M2 graph:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[M2 money supply](https://preview.redd.it/r3kdt4v2pyk61.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=251465226f305cd7687d088ee853546ef116f3eb)\n\nUnless you have been living under a rock this past year, the reason the government has been printing money like crazy is due to the money velocity falling like a rock due to the coronavirus pandemic. If money velocity is down, people and businesses aren't spending, and if people and businesses aren't spending, the economy contracts. Hence the need to inject money into the economy just to keep it afloat:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Velocity of M2 supply](https://preview.redd.it/yqs9c8c6pyk61.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4b140b90c74d9d2e229e6e72b2cb17631566537)\n\nThe primary way that the Fed has been dumping money into the economy is through Quantitative easing, meaning that the Fed will buy bonds and other securities during open market operations, AKA operation Bears R Fuk. This effectively allows the government to exchange existing securities on the market for cash, freeing up money in the economy.\n\nWhile the average citizen has been getting bent over a barrel with a vacuum attached to their wallet, the stock market has gone fucking insane over the past year. Why? Because for the most part, corporations, institutions, and boomers hold the instruments such as treasury bonds that are repurchased by the Fed during open market operations, which those groups and people then insert right into the stock market because there is nowhere else to park their money. Corporate bonds have been either risky or have low interest rates, US Government bond interest rates are garbage, businesses have been risky investments due to the 'rona, and only the stonks market has gone up. If we look at just before the pandemic to today, the value of all the stocks in the S&amp;P500 have increased around 5 TRILLION dollars. The graph that shows this can be seen here [https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp\\_500\\_market\\_cap](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_market_cap).\n\nKeep in mind that the GDP shrunk around 2.3% last year and unemployment is still relatively high, meaning that this growth is absolutely not organic at all.\n\nPart 3: What looks to be happening:\n\nOk, that was long. Now onto the bonds.Lets think about what's been happening so far over the past few bear weeks. Bond yields go up, market takes a massive shit, calls on $ROPE increase in value, The Bearcave(TM) becomes the hot new club. Right now, yields have nowhere to go but up, and the fed has no choice but to increase them, thereby tanking the market, which we will see next.\n\nAs the money velocity increases as the economy opens back up, the amount of total money flowing around will increase as the same dollar will move faster through the economy, artificially inflating it. If we keep the money supply the same as it is now while increasing the money velocity, we will have a serious problem on our hands. This is because the value of the economy as a whole has not increased, so more money will represent the same pool of goods, causing an extreme amount of inflation. The money printer was good when the economy was shut down and saved our asses from a great depression part 2, electric boogaloo, but will cause inflation unless the money supply is reduced as money velocity increases.\n\nThe fed knows this, and are currently in the process of issuing new debt in the form of bonds: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/record-414-billion-of-new-treasury-debt-issuance-poses-supply-test-for-shellshocked-bond-buyers-11614708102](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/record-414-billion-of-new-treasury-debt-issuance-poses-supply-test-for-shellshocked-bond-buyers-11614708102). This is quantitative tightening in action, with the fed now performing open market operations to reduce the money supply to prevent all that money from flooding and tanking the economy.\n\nBut there is a problem that the Fed is currently facing, which is that nobody wants bonds that have shit interest rates. To get people to buy their bonds, they have no choice but to raise interest rates. Time is also ticking, as the economy is reopening and the money velocity is increasing as can be seen in the FRED money velocity graph, meaning that if the fed doesn't raise rates, inflation will become a problem very quickly, and they will have to sharply increase rates or the entire US economy will be extremely fucked. As a side note the ratio of increase is higher in M1 than M2, which could potentially exaggerate damage to consumers. Unfortunately for the stock market, but fortunately for the **\ud83c\udff3\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b**'s who have not been hunted to extinction, as bond yields increase, money will flow from the stock market to other securities as well as back into the general economy, reducing the total funds in the stock market, causing it to crash.\n\nPart 4: My (Dance) Moves:\n\nPhew. That was long. Unfortunately, as of the writing of this post, it looks like higher interest rates could be around the corner at any time, and the higher they get the harder the market will drop as money flows from stocks to bonds and other less risky securities. To take advantage of this I plan to exit some long positions and swap them for cash as well as shares and calls on inverse market positions such as UVXY, SQQQ, and SPXS. Again this is not financial advice, and if you buy stocks that people mention on the internet without properly researching them first, you are actually retarded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit: (not financial advice)\n\nHi everybody. It looks like my post gained some traction last night. As a thank you to those who have read and commented, I will address some of the questions and points people are having in this edit so they are visible to all.\n\nOne of the more common questions/points is that the fed just won't allow rates to raise because they don't want it to.\n\nAgain like it says in the DD, at this time I do not believe the Fed is in control of the interest rates, and will quickly have no choice in the matter, no matter what daddy JPow says they will do. It may not happen today or this week, but it is coming. As money velocity goes up with the same amount of money in the system due to economic reopening, inflation takes off like a bat out of hell. If inflation goes up, the US dollar becomes less valuable, and if it goes up too much, the US Gov't will have exciting new problems to deal with. To reduce the money supply through QT the only real tool that the government has is open market operations to sell securities on the open market to reduce money supply, meaning that they need to sell bonds, which will require higher interest rates because they just aren't selling with the shit rates they are at now. The rates must increase to prevent widespread economic pain.\n\nAnother question is that why hold cash if there is inflation? Won't I lose money?\n\nThat may be true that your money will become less valuable if inflation takes hold, but you will have much less of it if you HODL during a crash or try to time the market.\n\nOK, now that some questions have been answered, bonus round:\n\nFirst lets talk about why the market crashes when funds flow out. The best way to think about the total market price at a macroeconomic level is through supply and demand. If we say that the supply is the total number of stonks in the market and demand is the amount of money in the market, we can see that generally the total money flowing in or out of the market is what determines market value, as the supply of stocks for sale is not changing a lot on a day to day basis across an index or a market.\n\nAnother thing to realize is that the Fed is between a rock and a hard place if you think about it. No matter what they do, there will be pain and someone will end up getting kneecapped holding bags. Loaning out money to get people to buy bonds looks bad, as it looks like a government scheme to con people into buy worthless bonds. Capping bond rates will kneecap and effectively nationalize the bond market, potentially sending shocks through the system. Do nothing and inflation fucks everything. Raise rates and the market gets flushed down the toilet. Rates are also so low they can't be decreased further.\n\nFinally, no matter what happens in the market, UVXY, SQQQ, and SPXS are currently at rock bottom prices. There is little room for them to shrink, but an enormous amount of room for them to grow.\n\nOnce again, thanks everybody and this is not financial advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJPow Interview and bond activity update: (as of 3/4/21, 4:00 PM)\n\nInterview sauce: [https://www.wsj.com/video/watch-jerome-powell-at-wsj-jobs-summit/10FF0DF9-C0E4-4215-8996-5E5BA991BBCE.html](https://www.wsj.com/video/watch-jerome-powell-at-wsj-jobs-summit/10FF0DF9-C0E4-4215-8996-5E5BA991BBCE.html)\n\nUS 10 year bond yield rates: [https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, this will be the last update on this DD before I let it ride and see what happens. After watching the JPow Jobs Summit interview, there are three things to take away, with the first two relevant and the third being very important. First is that at (3:55), Powell mentions that as spending surges due to reopening, the Fed will be expecting excess inflation. This is largely in line with and provides some evidence for my claim that as the money velocity increases, we will have inflation due to the money supply not contracting enough to prevent inflation.\n\nThe second is that for now, until the fed sees its goals met, i.e. max employment and price stability, or until inflation becomes a problem, the Fed will continue its policy of QE (timestamps 9:55 &amp; 18:55). This will continue to inject money into the economy, so no big surprise there, but do keep in mind that this money printing will need to be continually managed through selling treasury securities back on the open market, so if there continues to be trouble in the bond market, that may potentially have an effect on the current QE being undertaken.\n\nThe first two things are not surprising, but the third big takeaway is quite important, which is that the Fed is prepared to combat excessive inflation by raising rates. At (13:50), Powell was asked about the market sentiment that the Fed will raise rates earlier than expected. His response was that the Fed will not raise rates unless the labor market is at full employment or if inflation becomes excessive. As of now, inflation is around 1.5%, and the fed has a target of 2%. Powell mentioned many times that they are okay with inflation being a bit over that as long as it is transitory, but at (24:30) **Powell also said that the Fed will not let inflation get out of control,** and was very adamant about that.\n\nThe third takeaway is important as when coupled with the the fact that the rising money velocity will increase inflation as well as the fact that the US Gov't is struggling to unload bonds, it seems to suggest that the Fed will soon indeed have no choice but to raise rates to prevent excessive inflation due to the large money supply coupled with increasing money velocity. The sentiment in the bond market seems to agree, with the 10 year treasury yield up by 8 basis points today to 1.564%. This is also good evidence for my thesis that money from the stock market will rotate out into bonds and other investments as yields have no choice but to improve, and again today has been another bloodbath in the stock market. If this continues I would fully expect to see more money rotate out of stocks, further crashing the stock market. See y'all at my new favorite club, The Bearcave(TM).\n\nAgain, not financial advice.",

No I don't but no one can be 100% certain. If there is a crash, it's likely that things will rally soon after.

What Michael Burry found out, in particular, was that not a single GameStop was in the red; they were all making profit to some degree.\n\nAfter GME starting showing positive trends, people like Ryan Cohen and companies like Microsoft invested in the company as well. With these investors in the company, there was hope for GameStop to not go bankrupt and actually adapt with the rise of eCommerce.\n\nFinally, to really help GME go along, Microsoft and Sony announced that their latest consoles (the XBOX One X and PS5) were still going to support physical disc copies of games. This further gave reason to believe that full-digital wasn't the future just yet, and that there was still hope and profit to be had in physical products/locations.\n\n# And as GME started going up to most people's surprise, people started noticing how screwed shorters suddenly were...\n\nBut before we continue, I need to briefly explain what a *\"short squeeze\"* and *\"gamma squeeze\"* is. **If you already know, you can skip below.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**A \"short squeeze\" is when lots of people \"short\" shares, yet the price of the stock they shorted continues to go up, and eventually they're forced to cover their positions.** \n\n**This allows those with shares to sell the shares back to them at ridiculously high prices because, well, they have to buy them back.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**A \"gamma squeeze\" happens when many people make lots of  \"call\" options with market makers for prices that very high to reach (ex. a $100 call for a stock worth $10).**\n\n**They do this in hopes that not only will the stock attain that set price or higher, but more importantly that the market makers don't actually have the shares to give to them if/when the call options can be exercised.** \n\n**If this high volume of \"call\" options does get exercised, and market makers don't have the shares for them, that means that they'll be forced to buy the shares. Those with shares can then make them buy these required shares at much higher prices.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# SKIP POINT\n\nPeople online began to communicate with one another about GME, and pointed out that is was going up despite what shorters wanted to happen.\n\n **It was then that they theorized that with all the shares being shorted, and with the stock continuing to go up, that they could buy lots of GME shares and create many highly priced call options to create a short squeeze as well as numerous gamma squeezes.** \n\n# But they weren't going to accomplish this alone...\n\n**Other big players on Wall Street also saw what GME was capable of, and provided the high volume required to send GME to the moon. And they provided the high volume indeed...**\n\n# And thus began the GME Gamma Squeeze of January 2021\n\nWhat was once a $3-4/share company destined for bankruptcy suddenly sky-rocketed to a max of $480+ essentially overnight, and shorters and bears suddenly found themselves in billions worth of losses.\n\n# But we all know that big guys don't play nice.\n\nBefore more call options could be filled and the price of GME could go up any further, numerous brokers halted buying GME all together. This gave plenty of time for numerous \"call\" options to become worthless, and for shorters to regroup and recover their losses. \n\nAfter all, the DTCC gives a 21 day grace period for investors in huge debt to cover their positions, so these shorters were going to do everything they could within these 21 days to get the price of GME back down. This way, they could not only minimize their losses, but even get back into the green and continue to bankrupt GameStop.\n\nIn less than a month, GME plummeted to $40/share, and all seemed lost. Hedge funds would win once again, even by illegal means, and retail traders were given a grim reminder that they don't play by the same rules as the big players...\n\n# Yet this is not how GME ends.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, more hope was given that GME would rocket once again. \n\nKeith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill proved that not only did he still hold all his original shares in GME, he also doubled down on his position right after he announced that he would still buy GME during a Congress Hearing. \n\nDuring the same congress meeting, Melvin Capital (a hedge fund that lost 53% of its value because of the GME Gamma Squeeze) admitted that there was no short squeeze, and that the rise of GME to $400+ was a result of a gamma squeeze.\n\n**In other words, a \"short squeeze\" hasn't happened yet.**\n\nPeople found that shorts theoretically didn't all cover as shorters continued to be greedy and likely held on to their shorts as they thought they could still bankrupt GME like they originally planned. \n\nThey found that while short interest was seemingly much lower that there were still very few GME shares left to short and that shorters were still losing millions every time GME spiked to new level highs.\n\nRyan Cohen made it official that he would be heading GameStop's eCommerce division (because of course he is)...\n\nThere were meme tweets of ice cream, frogs, and 1980-90's games/movies...\n\nPeople began exercising call options once more, and now...\n\n# The GME rocket rises once again...\n\n# TL;DR: Shorters and Market Makers are currently in desperate positions where they need A LOT of shares of GME to cover their shorts and fulfill their \"call\" options, and retail investors (but most importantly big players) are buying and holding all the shares they can to make GME the Big Squeeze of the 21st Century.",

        "selftext": "The early lockup period on DASH ends on Tuesday, and DASH is going to fall like a stone. To understand why, first you have to understand (1) how massively over-valued DoorDash is, (2) the factors that have led to this valuation, and (3) why these factors are all going away this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DASH is massively over-valued, even by meme stock standards**\n\nWe all know that many stocks are currently \"over-valued\" according to traditional value metrics. This is especially true of emerging technology stocks, and has been fueled by historically low interest rates and rampant speculation. However, you don't even have to believe that this bubble is going to burst in order to see that DoorDash will fall; ***DASH is massively over-valued even just comparing it to its peers.***\n\nLet's look at DASH's public peers, namely Uber, Lyft, and GrubHub. Now, ride-hailing services are a different business than food delivery, but the technology involved it similar so I believe we can expect similar revenue multiples.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Uber:* [\\[1\\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=uber)\n\n*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $16.2B*\n\n*Current market cap: $103.21B*\n\n*Forward P/S forecast: 6.37*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Lyft:* [\\[2\\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=lyft)\n\n*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $3.1B*\n\n*Current market cap: $21.09B*\n\n*Forward P/S forecast: 6.8*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*GrubHub:* [\\[3\\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=grub)\n\n*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $2.2B*\n\n*Current market cap: $5.61B*\n\n*Forward P/S forecast: 2.25*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*GrubHub:* [\\[4\\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=dash)\n\n*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $3.7B*\n\n*Current market cap: $48.11B*\n\n*Forward P/S forecast:* ***13.01***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, DASH is trading at a **200% higher forward P/S compared to Uber and Lyft!** And a 600% higher forward P/S compared to GrubHub! This is in spite of the fact that Uber and Lyft will still be experiencing a Covid headwind for the first half of 2021, while DoorDash will no longer benefit from the Covid-driven demand surge in the second half of 2021. So 2022 should favor Uber and Lyft even more over DASH.\n\nFor DASH to simply come back down to valuation multiples similar to Uber and Lyft, it would need to drop from its current price of \\~$150, down to \\~**$75.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Covid, a small float, Covid, low interest rates, Covid, and IPO mania have led to this valuation**\n\nThe first factor is that DASH currently has a very small float, due to the lockup agreement from the IPO. DoorDash has a total of 286.34M shares outstanding, with only 97.61M currently available for trading [\\[6\\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dash). 114M more of those shares will be unlocked for trading on Tuesday, as the first of two lockup periods ends (the other lockup period ends in May).\n\nA small float makes it very easy for a stock to be moved up on small volume. DASH only has an average volume of 3.75M. This means that on Tuesday, ***30x the daily volume will be available for sale.***\n\nIn addition, DASH IPO'd at the exact right time to fetch an insane valuation. DoorDash raised $400 in a venture capital round in June 2020, at a value of $16B. This would give DASH a share price today of **\\~$50.** But Covid caused insane (and temporary) growth in DoorDash's revenue, which drove up excitement in the company. In addition, the IPO markets reached dot-com-bubble levels of froth (the last time IPOs would pop 100% on their first day of trading) this past year. That's why ***DoorDash rushed to IPO at the end of this year*** [\\[7\\]](https://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/the-rush-to-ipo-before-2020-ends/97862).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The bubble is ready to burst**\n\nLife will return to relative normalcy sometime this year. Demand for food delivery services will plummet. At the same time, interest rates are surging higher, which will continue to kill emerging tech growth stocks. The rampant speculation we've seen over the past year will die down soon. I believe DoorDash employees and insiders know (or at least fear) this, and will sell massive quantities of their shares this week as the lockup period expires. \n\nKeep in mind that this early lockup period only releases **40%** of employees' shares. If you joined DoorDash in 2018 when it was worth only **$1.4B(!)** [\\[8\\]](https://craft.co/doordash/funding-rounds) and became a multi-multi-millionaire as you saw the market cap of a company that pretty much everybody hates grow **30x** in 2 years, wouldn't you sell 40% of your shares the first time you got the chance?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*Disclosure: I currently have a variety of put spreads betting that DASH will fall. This is not investment advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. \\**",

More and more cases are arriving everyday with the same complaints and problems such as waiting weeks to get a reply and account being restricted. Not to mention some stock manipulation. Vlad either lost tons of money to be doing this or he sold out to God knows who. \n\nAlthough they have their Pros such as having a nice UI and beginner friendly, restricting stocks, accounts, selling stocks without consent and basically having no support are just bad.

Anyway here it is again, with puts Open Interest included.\n\nI've seen a lot of DDs repeating similar assumptions on gamma squeeze/delta hedging without actually providing accurate calculation on it; And it seemed, with the 7 million plus influx of new members to wsb, a large portion of  newcomers don't know the option's greeks yet. ***Thus, the reason for this post is to enable everyone here in wsb, to calculate the gamma squeeze effect for themselves(rough approximation), instead of relying on random DDs figures.***\n\nThe attached excel sheet allows you to model squeeze scenarios\n\n[Based on 3\\/3\\/21 Market Close Data](https://preview.redd.it/rs16fz0ye0l61.jpg?width=1136&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f0b249586e6852164f6099f0647ef41cb117615)\n\n**DOWNLOAD LINK**\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mx\\_ffBSS594b9C8O4H65Qp3YHdWcz3GF/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mx_ffBSS594b9C8O4H65Qp3YHdWcz3GF/view?usp=sharing)\n\n*^(You'll need to enable macro, needed to run Black Scholes functions, I promise no virii inside)*\n\nSo based on  the market close data of 3/3/21, using options data up to the 3/19 expiry, the net delta hedged shares by MMs stands at 6,852,559 \\*(\\*\\*^(If we assume most MMs try to be delta neutral)\\*). And if $GME price were  to increase to 200$, they would need to buy an additional 6,261,580 shares\n\nNow suppose you want to see what happens when someone buy 20,000 of 3/12 200 calls.

So a call option worth 20,000 x 5.2 x 100 = 10,400,000$, if the stock price increased from 124.8 to 200 (in 1 day) would have triggered an added 564,411 shares delta hedged (rough approximation), which was worth 564,411 x 124.8 = 70,438,492$ if bought outright, giving an amplification factor of roughly 7:1.(^(not using tick data to forecast price increase vs buying volume)) One common misconception is that if a call becomes ITM near expiry, MMs would have already bought &gt;90% of it in delta hedge, however  for a high IV like $GME, its closer to 60%.\n\n[3\\/5 120C](https://preview.redd.it/xn5i476cf0l61.jpg?width=1886&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0cb48e82c814a9db915a76204fb6b5f2c056f55)\n\nSo there you go \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d, with this hopefully you can start  counting \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c yourself, instead of relying on reddit randos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**^(Technical Notes :)**\n\n^(- To update data, download / copy paste options  from Barchart) [^(https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows&amp;expiration=2021-03-12-w)](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows&amp;expiration=2021-03-12-w)\n\n^(- The macro function  Black-Scholes in the excel sheet provides customizable BSM outputs(price,delta,gamma configurable based on the parameter inputs))\n\n^(- MMs are not legally obliged to be delta neutral, but most of them try to be.)\n\n^(- The standard BSM model is not what is currently used in the industry, but should be accurate enough to +-10%)\n\n^(- If you subscribe to barchart or any other data provider, use data query web to have the options data automatically refreshed by excel)\n\n^(- For tick data to accurately model volume vs price increase try IQFEED)\n\n*EDIT 1 : Assuming of course that most of your counterparty is MM(not closing out trades) and not wsb theta gang or people selling covered puts, I'll put the figure for $GME around 70-90%,*\n\n*EDIT 2 : I've added a simple pct value for people that pointed out, some counterparties would not be MMs, such as  spreads and covered calls/puts.

        "selftext": "TL, DR: $PLTR is **a huge long play** and the company has its toes dipped in essentially every single industry.\n\nHere are some fundamentals: market cap 44.6bn, 2020 revenue 1.1bn (482m from commercial, 618m from the government), and consistent earnings beat. \n\nIn 2020, their revenue increased by 47% and they signed 21 contracts during Q4 2020 (21 in 13 weeks = **avg 2 contracts a week last quarter**) and they are working with 8 companies of Fortune 100, 12 of Global 100, and 24 of Global 300 (LARGE potential growth in the future).\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020 they increased their revenue from the commercial sector by **107%.** This is very important as the commercial sector is where they will profit from the most. \n\nPalantir currently has two products Gotham and Foundry, with Gotham being used mostly by the US government and Foundry is for the commercial sector. Essentially these two software work by integrating with the customer's existing system and simulating different operational models and outcomes for different decisions that the customer makes. To me, this technology is revolutionary as proven by how unpredictable the state of the world economy is right now. \n\nA few of the big names that are working with them now is **IBM**, **PG&amp;E**, **BP**, and many hedge funds and banks, and a big one recently is a 31m contract with **NHS England** where they are working to handle vaccine allocation **(**this is significant as the UK is facing a historically tough recession**)**\n\nThey have been consistently working with the US government on multiple contracts using Gotham, from finding bin Laden to verifying Iran's nuclear presence in 2018. Palantir is **one of the four** institutions that were given DoD IL-5 and on their way to DoD IL-6, to give you a scale Google is DoD IL-2 and Oracle is DoD IL-4, meaning they are responsible for handling extremely sensitive information for the DOD, their most recent contract is *project Maven*. Essentially Palantir is the CIA's AI twin.\n\nLooking back at the fundamentals, especially with the P/S ratio of over 40 right now, it can be overpriced to get in. But in the near future, PLTR will be the best stock to hold for 5+ years as the sky is their limit.\n\nEdit: forgot to put my position 300 @24.9",

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nSo recently I was thinking..\n\nHedge funds want to protect themselves from a future GME incident and have obviously developed algorithms to essentially parse through WSB and see what stocks are gaining momentum. The problem is that it\u2019s extremely easy to parse through Reddit and find what post has a lot of upvotes and capture which stock ticker is mentioned. So, I was thinking why not make it more difficult for these bots (potentially causing further headaches for these hedgies) \n\nWhy don\u2019t we create a program that converts text to images that can\u2019t be parsed so easily.. kind of like a captcha system that bots can\u2019t easily win. This will make it way more difficult to parse and we can get a time advantage. As we know timing is essential here. \n\nObviously, it\u2019s easy for hedge funds to hire actual people to search through WSB and find the next stock that gains momentum; but that takes significantly more time; there has to be a solution here too .. I just don\u2019t know what it is.\n\nWhatever the case, I WONT be surprised if hedge funds are hiring people right now to write the code to go through Reddit to protect themselves. Let\u2019s at least give them a major headache!\n\n\nEdit: sharing ideas on a forum shouldn\u2019t be illegal. Algos manipulating stock prices and hurting retail traders should be ILLEGAL. I want to be able to share ideas to real humans and not bots designed to fuck us over. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\n\nEdit #2: Potentially we can use ReCaptcha something that\u2019s has been out for a long time (Google has developed this over many years) before allowing access to any DD.\n\nEdit #3: I really like this suggestion by /u/TheLegendDevil: \u201cOne way to beat them would be a browser plugin that changes your comment before posting to make all words that are close to being a ticker actually a ticker. Easy way to one way encode messages and humans should still be able to decipher what stock they were actually talking about.\u201d",

        "selftext": " \n\nEverything right now is too perfect. Please be aware of this.\n\nIf I were a hedge fund right now I would be co-coordinating a fake squeeze. This is the only sure fire and likely way to cause most retail investors to exit their positions. This is also the easiest way for them to join in their fight against us longs and diamond hands. I am certain this will happen soon.\n\nWhat will happen?\n\nHedges will continue to allow the price to rise, 300, 400, 500. By this time the whole world will be back into buying GME and it will potentially go to $900/1000 a share on momentum alone. At this point half of Wallstreet bets (the new paper hands) and potentially this sub WILL sell half, if not all their shares. I don't like this idea anymore than you do but this is likely to happen. Most people have lives and bills to pay and $1000 a share is too attractive.\n\nFrom here, the hedgies, along with the sell off with mass attack the price down easily to probably pre 100 numbers. Much like a month ago, then we will be back to another long wait. This is their only way out. They will be able to buy back shares and would possibly even start shorting again. Sure the main squeeze won't have arrived but this will have put so many shares back into circulation for them. Meaning we will have to wait much longer for the real thing.\n\nHow do we counter this?\n\nWe acknowledge this is coming and stop looking at the share price as a number. We will \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c forever and come together knowing this is the only way. If we don't all do this, we will be countered again just like in Jan.

Is the post history and discussion on these threads legit? It sure doesn\u2019t seem that way. \n\nI\u2019ve been a heavy lurker of WSB since the GME rise and this community has vibe. I\u2019m not an OG but have noted when og\u2019s post on what it used to be and I was here pre 2million and I\u2019ve watched closely (I live on refreshing new) how this sub has evolved over the last 2 months. \n\nUWMC started popping up so I checked it out and saw that a bottom could be nearing so I put in a tiny bit just to watch it (10@9.80). I then went back to dig for some real DD. Problem is, there is none. This has a P&amp;amp;D feel and an ugly stench. I was bummed when RKT took off (without me on it and there was good DD on it) but the plummet got me hopeful that maybe some of the gains gets funneled into GME (I have a position). Which leads me back to UWMC.  It doesn\u2019t feel right. It doesn\u2019t look right. It doesn\u2019t seem right. \n\nIf UWMC is a hedge distraction, involving yourself only helps them. If you\u2019ve done your own DD and believe, awesome. I for one won\u2019t be tossing anything more at it. Good luck out there.\n\nMy original post was taken down and I\u2019m not sure why. I\u2019m not hip to all the rules. If the opening is any indication, I think it bolsters my theory. And to the folks that think I\u2019m GME focused. I am but wouldn\u2019t be sad if it drops to the 80s, that\u2019s called a fire sell and I love buying shit on sale.\n\nEdit: The main point of this post wasn\u2019t to be a conspiracy but to be weary of the hype. Do your own DD. If you like the stock then buy it. The whole you better get on board now crowd is sketch and was why I posted this in the first place. Make your money.

        "selftext": "Like a lot of my fellow smooth-brained \ud83e\udd8d, I view $SKT as not just the next short squeeze, but primed for a gamma squeeze that *will look insane* and just might resuscitate the engulfed bricks-and-mortar retail industry. There are a lot of heavily shorted names out there, and while I expect most of them to reap massive tendies, $SKT is the one that stands out.\n\nLet's start with the elephant in the room: **short-interest** and **% float**. $SKT is currently the most shorted stock out there, with 31.76% of total shares short as of this morning. This beats any of the names we know, GME, AMC, BB, RKT, etc. Interestingly enough, $SKT's \\*% short float is at 47.25%!!\\*Compared to every other \"meme stock,\" (other than GME with 60% +), $SKT is easily one of the most, ***if not THE most*** shorted names in the market right now. ([https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)).\n\nNot to mention, *the shares float* provides incredible insights into $SKT's future tendies. Similarly to GME, SKT only has about 90M shares outstanding, while GME has roughly 69M (lol). BBBY has about 121M shares outstanding, which explains why it got somewhat closer to GME than others. But these other names- RKT (1.98B shares), AMC (339M shares), NOK (5.7B shares), BB (563M shares), all have simply *too many shares outstanding*. That's not to say it's impossible to squeeze 'em, but it would require far less capital to squeeze GME, BBBY, or say, **$SKT**.\n\nThe trend in short-interest also seems to be going down, with $SKT and the broader market in general. The WSJ wrote something last week about hedge funds starting to close shorts (or at least being more cautious), and after being the 4th largest put decrease overall in Q4, SKT short interest is off another 19% since February.\n\nOver the past 6 months, we have also seen ever-increasing volume on $SKT. A previous DD mentioned average trading volume on $SKT from the Dec-Feb period was roughly 3M shares, this has increased to roughly $5M shares in the last few months. Today, $SKT appeared to breach the seal with over 17.5M, topping the 10M high we saw in Jan (coincided w/ GME). *This is incredibly important b/c heavy volume when a stock moves up puts massive pressure on long shorts*. *Essentially, if I am right, Chapter 1 began today.* (we should keep an eye on the volume this week, more volume is a *great* sign).\n\nAll of the technical trends bode well for $SKT. But what's got me stiffer than a rock are the broader macro forces guiding both the market and the economy. First, $SKT reinstated their dividend for 2021 Q1, indicating they have ample cash not only to weather this storm, but to continue raising payouts to shareholders, which is quite attractive since \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b are getting concerned about rising rates. No problem- SKT has stable, fixed payments, and will award investors for holding- *these will also increase as the economy improves, attracting more investors*. **\u2705**\n\nNext, we heard from Biden earlier in the week that they expect vaccine distribution to be ramped up by May, not July. This is a *huge WIN* for battered-down bricks-and-mortar retailers who have caved b/c of public health restrictions. As investors race to pick up these forgotten family spots, the \"value\" or really just oversold names will start to fly. **\u2705**\n\nNot to mention, Tanger Mall Outlets' whole premise is their malls are ***OUTDOORS***, perfect for a post-Covid world that is more mindful of social distancing/sanitation. **\u2705**\n\nWhere do I think this could go? This is where market cap/valuation comes into play. For all you dipshits who look at the share price and ask \"wHy It DoNt Go Up,\" *market cap is the true determinant*. $SKT currently has a $1.7B market cap, far less than competitors MAC ($2.1B), SPG ($40B) or other highly shorted names like RKT ($56B) or AMC ($2.9B).\n\nSo is a $200 price target a little fluffy and optimistic? Sure. But tldr, when you factor in **how shorted $SKT has been** (heavily shorted by Melvin Capital among others; most shorted stock right now- overall/float), the **attractive fundamentals** (outdoors/social distancing friendly), the **improving economic landscape** (vaccine ramp-up by May/$2T stimulus that will really help small companies), **rising rates** (the shift towards value/dividend-paying stocks)- I have to say, I like the stock, quite a lot.\n\nSo help me God, $SKT is going to fucking *skrt-skrt* to the moon!\n\n\\*UPDATE: A lot of people have been saying Melvin Capital owns SKT. This is **FALSE**. Melvin owns SKT convertible debt- likely b/c they are grubbing for yield (who can blame them on something as fruitful as SKT)? This actually is a good sign to me, as boomers who find SKT dividends attractive will push up the stock- another catalyst for a gamma squeeze. *Never ever fall victim to false information, please do your own homework*.\n\n**Link to Melvin puts on SKT**: [https://fintel.io/i/melvin-capital-management-lp](https://fintel.io/i/melvin-capital-management-lp)\n\n\\*\\*This is not financial advice. Please do your own research and evaluate your portfolio from there.\n\nCurrently own 4/16 $25C; 6/18 $30C; 9/17 $30C",

        "selftext": "First I want to point out something that should be obvious, but by reading comments here it doesn't appear to be that obvious to many:\n\n1. HF's who lost billions of $$ on $GME...they're not going to attempt to make those losses back on a SINGLE STOCK. Institutions don't get emotionally attached to a single stock. \n\nNow that we have that out of the way, on to the DD:\n\n# Why does $GME have these massive price swings intraday, then crash?\n\n**Answer: Because institutions are pushing the price up, selling at the top, and making millions....here is how they do it.**\n\n1. Buy ITM calls on $GME\n   1. *This will appear as a \"large print\" on a number of dif. sites where people literally stare at large volume option buys all day. Typically when a huge buy comes in the options market it's an institution. It would be rare for a retail buyer to be doing 2 million dollar option buys. Often when this happens those apps / discord live chat / reddit have people saying hey look at this massive print, someone must know something.*\n2. Buy OTM calls on $GME\n   1. *Institution will then buy deep OTM calls. This also would show up as unusual options activity, and just create a confirmation bias based on the first ITM call that got printed.*\n3. Buy $GME shares\n   1. *Enough to get the price rolling upwards...causing momentum. When you have a stock like $GME that has eyes on it every second of the day during trading hours people notice very quickly when it's on the move. You have a collective mindset that this stock can go to $800 / share, $1,000 / share $10,000 / share ....or $420,000.69 / share. So when the price gets rolling people FOMO buy.*\n\n**This is how an institution can get the price of something moving in the direction they want. Now how do they capitalize on it?**\n\n1. Selling those ITM call options at a massive profit\n2. Selling those OTM calls at a massive profit\n3. Selling the shares, again, for a massive profit....\n\nHowever, Institutions are smart, they're not going to dump everything all at once. This is why you'll get these double peaks in the recent trading days. If they sold off everything at once it would almost certainly trip the circuit breakers, that has not happened in a while. \n\n**If an institution today had bought a reasonable portion of $GME at $160, and started to sell at $200...they'd make over $4mm dollars. That + the options (and potentially buying puts when it was at $200) it would be easy to clear $20-$100mm a day on $GME with a fairly small amount of capital in terms of institutional money.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain...an institution isn't trying to clear $20 billion on a single trade....you think the SEC isn't going to investigate that? But a $4mm gain... a $20mm gain? even a $100mm gain in a single day? That's nothing, happens all the time and would present zero reason for the SEC to even consider something happening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe saw this on Monday last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c7ffzx02xul61.png?width=2024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bf457a75071b16b5d55db58807fdaa57234b946\n\nThursday of last week\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akxv0eq4xul61.png?width=2008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3361fc84eee2cec1d9f25d8cd4f8c789927213ff\n\nFriday of last week\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5mdvib6xul61.png?width=2030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7f6ca51af9c940a186cc00c8a1575096963d8de\n\nAnd again on Monday (today) of this week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsu3i4t8xul61.png?width=1996&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec151bc41b2c03ebfcc6c4468592db8bad8c4304\n\nWhat do every single one of those charts have in common? **The stock never closes the day HIGHER than the high of the day.**   \n\n\nIf I look at unusual options activity for today on $GME I highly doubt that a retail buyer is making a $1.4mm or $1.3mm buy on $GME. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjaf87dbxul61.png?width=1390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fde04e830686de45ce90395fa8817bb314ed32c\n\nIf we look at February -&gt; March of this year it's obvious that institutional money is going into $GME.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7i7n6q3oxul61.png?width=1864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ea93ac64c0ab93de2b96f714c129fdc135ba3f1\n\nbut again...before you doubters come out...there is not an institution in the world who's going to dump $100mm into $GME in an attempt to make $1bn + off a single day / trade. No institution is that stupid, or going to do something that is a giant red flag for the SEC to come look at your books. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Sentiment Trading\" is becoming a popular topic, and as long as there is a stock as hyped up as $GME...there is going to be institutions making boat loads of money off retail investors who are \"buying the dip\"",

        "selftext": "***Edit:*** **Special thanks to the mods for their quick response time in this post's auto-deletion. We really appreciate the hard work you guys are doing. Well, I do anyway.**\n\n*Disclaimer: Feel free to add objective/rebuking opinions here, I have no hate or disdain for opposite views. I'd welcome some constructive discussion on whether my viewpoint sounds viable or not. I'm in this deep either way.*\n\nSo I've worked in the game industry as a Tech Artist for just over 8 years now, and I connected some dots in January while reading through all the DD about GME.  I've dealt with publishers and capital management firms both in person at GDC and elsewhere, and I am working on my own game project on the side so I am actively dealing with platforms and launching, and I still hold to my guess that **Ryan is aiming at launching an online distribution service to compete with Steam, and potentially overtake it as the strongest digital games distribution platform.**\n\nWhy? Steam doesn't have much competition outside of other publishers who mostly just have a store to front their own games. Gamestop could become an unbiased online platform that also has physical stores where you can buy consoles, PC parts, and trade in used games for credit in said online platform. It's not a gold mine, it's a diamond-encrusted tendie mine waiting to be built. Gamestop has the ability to focus their resources around this strategy, and now is the time to do it.\n\nRyan already has a focus on digital commerce and there is a reason he started following Steam and Epic, and why they are moving more into PC gaming and improving their digital footprint. I can't tell you how long I have felt that Steam is kind of a monopoly in the market, and whoever manages to launch a solid competitor to them is going to be rich beyond their wildest dreams.\n\nSteam makes 30% from the sale of every single game on their platform, and they have a ridiculously small staff running the entire service. It's built to be almost entirely automated, even down to the advertisements running on the store pages. I talked to a bunch of Valve guys at an indy conference a couple years ago and they said the amount of money Steam makes is disgusting considering how little is needed to keep it running, and it needs almost no improvement since it runs well and people like it.\n\nIf they pull it off and become a major competitor to Steam, a 40b, 50b, and even 100b market cap isn't unrealistic in 5 years. Why? If you knew how many games Steam sells on an average basis, you would crap yourself. And as I said, they take a 30% cut across the board. Do you know how much 30% of every game sold on Steam is? I'll give you a hint: it's a lot. Steam has essentially been printing money for years with no real competition. Epic Games is still getting started and is popular with only a few of their titles so far, they are expanding but their focus is divided between the store, Fortnite, publishing, and of course their Engine, which I use regularly and love. Gamestop in this space would be 100% focused on their store and ecommerce. That is a big deal.\n\nA 100b market cap would value GME at $1431 per share if compared to today's 124 @ 8.66b, at regular market valuation. That's not the squeeze number. Even 40b on a conservative estimate puts it at $572/share.\n\nI'm not a trade aficionado so my calculations about the valuations may not be spot on since my specialty is in my industry and not finance. I'm open to more business/finance wrinkle-brains to give me more accurate numbers for those market caps. But Steam has been without any real competition for over a decade now, and Gamestop has the capital, infrastructure, and now the leadership to make this happen.\n\nI'm looking forward to the squeeze as much as the rest of you but to be 100% honest, this is going to go Nuclear if I am right, and not as a temporary squeeze. I could be wrong, but in my mind it would be stupid of them not to do it, they have all the pieces ready, and Ryan is the puzzlemaster.\n\nLet's fucking go.\n\n***TLDR: Gamestop may be positioning themselves to become a major competitor in the digital game distribution market alongside and potentially even surpassing Steam, Epic, and GoG.***\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Edit:** 230 @ 125. I'm going to be adding to my position as often as I can because if I am right ***this is going to make 150/share during a squeeze seem like peanuts***. What's past alpha centuri?\n\n**Edit 2:** Loving the discussion this is provoking. As much as I love the memes, it's good to bring up the signs that GME's future outlook makes them extremely undervalued even without the squeeze, but goddamn I am lookin forward to tendies either way \ud83d\ude80.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo we recently got NIO's 2020 Q4 and full year financial results. Some highlights include:\n\n1) $2.5 billion reached for annual revenue \n\n2) Gross margins grew to 17.2%\n\n3) Positive full year operating cash flow \n\n4) $6.5 billion in the war chest as of 31st of December 2020\n\n5) Q1 deliveries expected to be above 20,000 EVs \n\nOverall, NIO has shown amazing improvements; they've definitely come a long way, and to anyone who can look at the results honestly, it's evident that NIO will be much higher in the future. One of the reasons I say this is because of what we're seeing from the media trying to spin this situation negatively; and while it is true that anxiety regarding semiconductors and batteries can limit NIO's production, from the information we have, it doesn't appear it will have much of an effect.\n\nIn the earnings call, NIO's CEO Willie Li Bin (NIOgang's homeboy) said that NIO will be producing 7,500 EVs in the second quarter 2021 until July wherein the production capacity will increase to 12,500--meaning an annual 150,000 EV production; it's also knows that this will potentially double again to 300,000 in 2022--meaning 25,000 NIO EVs produced a month.\n\nIt should also be knows that yes NIO's deliveries were down in February, but this is due to the Lunar new year holiday; literally people were not at work. But interestingly, NIO delivered 5,578 in February, beatings Xpeng's 2,223. \n\nIf you go to some of the forums like Stocktwits or Twitter, there's bears/shorts deliberately trying to scare people to sell--as if what's written above is bad news. Here's the [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/chinese-tesla-rival-nio-chip-shortage-will-hit-electric-car-production.html) for the 'bad news' these fearmongers are dragging out. \n\nTake the supposed EPS miss by NIO: as the analyst Edison Yu points out, the EPS miss is misleading because it was actually due to the FX loss (the weak USD hurting NIO's cash balance). Basically not NIO's fault. Here's the [link](https://twitter.com/edison__yu/status/1366538414271660032) to his statement. \n\nThe fact that NIO is ramping up production (remember that even at 7,500 this is more than their monthly deliveries in 2020); the fact that NIO has openly said they're entering Europe in H2 ([link](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/03/19912404/nio-to-begin-exporting-evs-to-europe-in-second-half-of-2021-report)); the fact they have $6.5 billion now; the fact that production will be 12,500 from July, and 25,000 in 2022--all of these show how much of a winner NIO is, and why NIOgang will stay strong. \n\nBut watching all the negativity, it definitely reminds me of last year around this time, before NIO went up over 1,000%. I think it could happen again. I think about it while I'm at work; and I remember that it was Reddit where I first found NIO, and NIOgang\n\nWe've gotten fantastic news recently; don't let the haters drag us down. \n\nI like the stock.",

        "selftext": "Alright so let me start off by mentioning that i'm a long time lurker, first time poster in WSB, and thought it time to make my first contribution. I know, I know, I didn't think my first contribution would be about a Jim Cramer Boomer Stock... but yea, it really is. But just follow along with me here.\n\nI first began the day planning out my next moves for when I start jumping off the tech train (like right about now), and begin embracing the market for post pandemic retail/life (and once the CPI begins to bump, the moves for making money in the market during inflation). This led me to look at commodities and companies which deals with commodities.\n\n**ENTER COSTCO**\n\nI then pull up COST and wonder what the heck am I looking at. Why is there such a dip!?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs582ukeerk61.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd299c206740f45dbfec2923e2483ee9e4fd46cd\n\nThere must have been some terrible news right? Being an avid costco shopper to feed my family of 5, I begin researching what terrible thing happened to Costco to cause such a rapid selloff. But the more I looked the more I realized that this selloff is really just weird...and it could be an opportunity to get some tendies...(or rotisserie chickens...see what I did there?)\n\n**Researching Possible Causes**\n\nCould it be massive shorting like we all see with other stocks? No, its only running 0.98% of shares shorted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6jtyoyferk61.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52d06efbe13966d7ee2d559e5a7c4fd0d7f6a106\n\nWas there any news of accidents or management issues? None that I could find on google.\n\nThen I come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things\n\n**Warren Buffet Sells his shares of Costco**\n\nhttps://www dot yahoo dot com/lifestyle/warren-buffett-dumps-all-his-costco-stock-3-reasons-why-that-is-a-big-surprise-235600486.html\n\nWell, considering that he sold it off prior to November 16th 2020 (could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 9-10th?) shouldn't the stock have begun to drop from there? It should have, but it didn't. So I looked some more and found that Costco announced a special $10 dividend (which is pretty high...I mean RKT announced a $1.11 div and thought that was amazing). My first thought was that damn, Costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend, and second, that this drop isn't justified if Costco is making a ton of money.\n\nhttps://finance dot yahoo dot com/news/supermarket-chain-costco-declares-special-222312149.html\n\nHere's a chart with the dividend marked (you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nnd0trherk61.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=063271b9d3c38f3b13c8d7296a83c7e1171f5f18\n\nAs you can see, right after the dividend has passed, the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end, and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head, im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason.\n\nSo I do some due diligence and look at the financials, earning calls, etc. I then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price. They seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9hpvqcjerk61.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830afac11cd00a1ba28c1822105e29a3b5ae78c3\n\nEach blue vertical line marks an earnings call, where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards. Each call is followed by a swing of about 10 points up or 10 points down. Typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds. This confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of Costco, there really isn't any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further (or remain the same).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztl2qhukerk61.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5c4a01bd3fa1ea890684719df463cccf602b57a\n\nAs you can see, the stock is just completely oversold, trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife (you know, buy the dip)...but what could slow the downfall and even reverse it?\n\n**Enter the earnings call March 4th and why I am Bullish**\n\nLooking through the financials, Costco has continuously beat its earnings.\n\n&gt;This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.04%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the most recent quarter, Costco was expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, but it reported $2.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.85 per share, while it actually produced $3.13 per share, a surprise of 9.82%.\n\nhttps://news dot yahoo dot com/costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-171005710.html\n\nAnd looking at its previous 2 years of March earnings, it has always beat its December earnings (for all you call options people). I didn't do a screen capture as its a long scroll. But the data is on the link below. Just look at all the March earnings vs the one reported before it.\n\nhttps://www dot marketbeat dot com/stocks/NASDAQ/COST/earnings/\n\nThe most recent price target estimate I could easily google (ALL above where its trading now)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4obvitmerk61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5196871a95da03e36cea4ad3f807545f3397fb50\n\n**Fundamentals (if they matter anymore) have not changed, AND WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.**\n\n**They make a ton of money (selling tendies):**\n\n&gt;In FY 2020, ended August 30, 2020, Costco posted year-over-year (YOY) gains in revenue, net income, and other metrics. Total revenue increased by 9.2% YOY while net income attributable to Costco climbed by 9.4% YOY.3\ufeff The company said that its e-commerce business saw a 50% YOY increase in sales for FY 2020 as a result of gains in grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.4\ufeff  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Costco posted revenue of $43.2 billion and net income attributable to Costco of $1.2 billion in its Q1 FY 2021, ended November 22, 2020. Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.\n\n**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**\n\nContinuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.\n\n**They are international (also making tendies):**\n\n&gt;Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.\n\nhttps://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774\n\n**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**\n\n&gt;Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.\n\nhttps://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx\n\nCostco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nI like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?) Calls. Ill have 60 shares come market open tomorrow.\n\nedit: fat fingered march 5th instead of march 4th earnings call.\n\nedit 2: i wrote horizontal line instead of vertical line when referencing the plotted earnings calls (too much writing!).",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow investors!\n\nI've received several messages lately asking how I find investment opportunities. Rather than putting minimal effort into those individual replies, I put more effort into putting my thoughts in writing for anyone to read.\n\nI am by no means an expert, and have no clue what I'm actually doing, so I wouldn't recommend listening to me. I hope my investment journey inspires you to enjoy your own investing journey, and we all continue to challenge each other to become better investors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 1. Look in places where others will not\n\nIf someone asks you 'would you invest in x', and your answer is anything other than, 'it depends', you're thinking the way I used to think. Four years ago I worked with a businessman who was very successful in real estate development. He attributed his success to his philosophy that he will always take time to listen and consider an investment proposal. If he finds a chance to invest in something, the answer is always yes, he wants the chance to learn more and fully understand the opportunity. When the terms aren't favorable to him he won't invest, but often enough those investments that he shouldn't have even considered according to conventional analysis turned into much greater returns that he could have found elsewhere. This type of value is often hidden, easily overlooked and usually difficult to quantify.\n\nMy approach takes a lot of time, I spend around 4 hours each day researching companies. There's always something to learn from my research even if I don't end up making an investment in a company. Curiosity makes an excellent research partner.\n\nMy primary target is undervalued companies, not stocks that will create long term value over time. I want something that I can buy today for $1 knowing at the very worst I will sell it for $0.50, but optimistically can sell it in 6 months for $10. More on how this can be profitable later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2. Dig through the dirt for trades that won't show up on a screener\n\nMy research process is far from glamorous or tech savvy. If Keith Gill's style is the Roaring Kitty, mine is the Caffeinated Pig. I sit in a coffee shop with a caramel latte, go to otcmarkets website, filter by OTCQB, QX and Pink Current (because that's all Vanguard lets me trade), and dig through that list of 1400 mostly trash companies to look for hidden treasures.\n\nI probably spend about 5 minutes on each company before I move on, unless I see potential and then I'll spend a lot more time. There's no way that the 2 week old 8K that implies a beautiful future for a company will show up on your screener. I do this 5 days a week for at least 4 hours, and have done this for around 3 years. And that's it, that's how I find companies to invest in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3. Prioritize signs of good capital management and protective corporate structure\n\nThe companies that are traded OTC usually have pretty dismal financial statements, either due to lack of data, or they're simply hot messes that no sane person would ever invest in. Often they're hot messes with a limited history, so I don't put too much weight on comparing ratios to industry averages and those types of fundamental analysis.\n\nInstead I want to see how the company is structured.\n\nHow many investors? How many lenders hold convertible debt? What are conversion terms? Did anyone involved with this company manage a publicly traded company in the past? What happened to that company? Is their attorney a scumbag who I won't name here but seems to specialize in pump and dumps? Have their investors previously invested in companies that turned out to be pump and dumps? Who owns the majority of shares? What types of shares are there? How has share structure been managed? Is the company set up in a way that it's easy to benefit the CEO, Investors and Preferred shareholders and the expense of common stock holders? How much capital on hand before the next S1/dilution? These are the sorts of things I ask myself when researching a company.\n\nI want to protect my capital, and need to know there aren't conflicting interests inherent in the company structure. I love to see strong ownership structure with insiders owning a large majority of common shares. A great example of very strong ownership and share structure is USDR, I just published my research on them if you're interested in seeing what I mean. You can find it in my post history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 4. Imagine the extremes\n\nMy love for investing is directly correlated to my ability to be creative in my trades. I dreamed that AsiaBroadband would go viral, and even wrote a DD on it when it was back at a penny (also in my post history). My mind is still blown that the stock not only did what I imagined was possible but to an even bigger degree!! I owned 4.3million shares back when it was at a penny. I sold most by $0.14. three days later it hit $0.60.\n\nI learned that I didn't dream big enough.\n\nBy imagining the extreme's of both bullish and bearish situations that could impact a stocks share price, I structure my portfolio in a very speculative, maximum upside minimum downside theory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 5. Embrace risk, and structure it\n\nEvery time my dad gives me a hard time about my high risk investments, I remind him of his 'safe' investment in the 'Value Stock' Charter Communications back in 2008 before they filed Chapter 11. Common stock holders lost everything, my dad lost $15,000 (at the time I was 18, he was the sole wage earner in our family and only made $40,000/year and was planning to use that money for my college). Shout out to Paul Allen for screwing over the little guy.\n\nI invest in some pretty sketchy companies, so what's the point of evaluating risk in a fundamental sense if this stuff happens on the major exchanges? Also, do I really care about volatility in a company when a stock price has been bouncing 5-10% every day for the last month? No, I care about volume, I want to be assured that I can get my money out quickly if Mr. Market decides the price should go down dramatically. Here are some other considerations that impact risk.\n\n* If a company has strong performance by fundamental standards and very little downside, but limited upside, I will usually pass.\n* If a company has terrible performance by fundamental standards, but limited downside and lots of upside, I will dig deeper\n* I like companies with limited downside, generally no more than 100% above the 52 month low, with daily volume at least 5x my investment, but with 10x-40x upside potential based on market cap and current share structure. This is all totally subject to change given the situation.\n* Fox example I have $60k in LexaGene right now, and the daily volume on that stock sometimes dips to around $20,000 traded per day. If some terrible news comes out about LexaGene, there's a real chance I could lose the majority of my investment because there's not enough volume for me to liquidate my position quickly. I accept this risk given the 13x minimum upside potential with a company and product that I really believe in. This is the type of investment I can make 9 times in a row and be wrong, and on the 10th time when it runs 13x I'll have $240,000 more in my investment account than before I made those last 10 trades. That's a 400% return.\n* Technology, anything that scales, biopharma, acquisitions/mergers and any kind of government contracts usually seem to be what I end up investing in.\n* My portfolio is usually between 5 and 7 positions representing 15-30% of my portfolio in each stock, and 10-20% cash.\n* I monitor my portfolio daily, and keep an eye on news using the 'News Dashboard' on Koyfin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 6. Don't just project financials, project potential\n\nI do project financials, but don't put a lot of stock in my projections. The real purpose of projecting financials is to help me determine the upside potential that a situation has. A current example that illustrates this perfectly is in the diagnostic space, LexaGene (LXXGF) and Zomedica (ZOM).\n\nLexaGene is almost entirely undiscovered. Volume on slow days equates to around $20,000 per day in shares traded. LexaGene has a market cap of $150million, with a product that is designed to meet demand in a much broader market than Zomedica, with tech that's arguably superior to Zomedica, enough cash on their balance sheet to last them another 9-12 months, and is currently going through FDA EUA application and projected to receive EUA in the next 2 months to begin COVID screening (which by the way, LexaGene's MiQLab is the only product of it's type that can screen for up to 24 strains of COVID in a single test. Talk about future proofing. I could go on and on about LexaGene, but will stop now and just write a DD on it later this week.\n\nZomedica on the other hand has a market cap of $2billion, with no sales, has limited themselves to veterinary market (which is greatly suffering right now due to disrupters like Chewy that are siphoning revenue away from veterinarians) and their tech has no real differentiator when compared to LexaGene's MiQLab.\n\nMy financial projection in this case is pretty simple. I believe LXXGF has more earning potential than ZOM, so it's safe to assume at least a similar market cap once LXXGF becomes more widely known. $2billion/$150mm, for a conservative estimate of LXXGF running 13x with very limited downside risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 7. I invest in fundamentally poor companies, so I don't miss the 'bad' winners\n\nI don't have a lot of faith in my stock picking ability. Generously figuring if I could be right 50% of the time, and if I were to only invest in the 'good' companies by conventional analysis, I would miss out on half of the winners that I deemed 'bad investments'.\n\nWhat if there was a way to not miss out on the 'bad' winners? There is, I do it through risk management and portfolio structuring.\n\nI make fundamentally bad investments that have limited downside, and 10x-40x upside when I imagine the wildest upside scenario possible. Then I actively manage my downside risk, I'll typically start to exit a position at 20% down from my average price per share. I'm accepting a 20% loss in pursuit of a 10x-40x return. Even if I'm only right 1 in 20 times on a 10x play, I still make a 620% return over those 20 investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# That pretty much sums up my investment style. I don't recommend it, but I sure enjoy what it has done for me :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For anyone who cares, the following is a little insight into my beliefs that have shaped my investment strategy.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe we are conditioned to think in a binary way. Black or White. Right or Wrong. Good or Bad. Reality suggests that very few things are binary and the 'Truth' more often than not lies somewhere in the middle. A really smart guy once wrote 'there is nothing new under the sun' and yet I used to think that my new screener setting would lead me to the moon with tendies. Like someone else hasn't tried that screener setting before.\n\nInvesting is a welcoming home for a binary thinker, a place where the Right or Wrong mind can always seek to make the 'right decision' and find plenty of support to reassure him that he made the right decision and comfort him on his loosing trades. The truth is, there is no right and wrong in trading.\n\nIf you make money on a trade, you made money. It doesn't mean you made the right decision, it means you made a decision that made you money. Same when you loose, you made a decision to sell at a loss. You didn't make the right or wrong decision. You can make every decision right and still lose money. Benjamin Graham called this 'Mr. Market', somedays Mr. Market will give you a deal and sometimes he'll offer you a really good deal, but usually you're stuck with mundane deals and lots of bad deals.\n\nMy target return is very ambitious, I shoot for 20% a month compounded, so an annually return of \\~890%. That's ridiculous you say? Why yes, it is! And it makes me happy to get out of bed and pursue this ridiculous goal. I want to love this journey.\n\nA few years ago I came to a point where I considered giving up trading because I felt like a failure. I was making money on 'bad decisions' and losing money on 'good decisions'. I didn't have a clue what I was doing. Thankfully I received some much needed guidance and inspiration from people much smarter than me, and realized I needed a different investment strategy. I still don't have a clue what I'm doing, but I'm much happier and much more profitable doing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for taking time to read my experience and philosophy, I hope you found this useful in your investing journey.\n\nBT",

        "selftext": " \n\n**TL;DR PT for Friday 3/12/2021 $388**\n\nI'm refraining from mentioning the ticker name on purpose\n\nHere our my thoughts on a PT of $388 for Friday 3/12/2021\n\nBy drawing a line in sand for multiple points in time I can calculate the change in price related to volume.\n\nThe two most notetable points in time for me was the [trading halt](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/buying-stocks/articles/why-are-brokers-halting-gamestop-trading/) on 1/28/21 and when [DFV doubled down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnqgz8/gme_yolo_update_feb_19_2021/) on 2/19/2021. The time between these two events was exactly 21 days. Thus using 21 days I back tracked to 1/6/2021 for a basis of price and volume change up to the trading halt. I then used 21 days to estimate where I will be 21 days from DFV's double down ; we are currently on day 18 and day 21 will be Friday 3/12/2021.\n\nFirst I calculated price change by looking at the open and close price for each event\n\nPrice change = Close Price - Open price\n\nThis tells me how much price action took place over a given event\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Event|Start|End|Days|Open|Close|Price Change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| Start | 1/6/2021 | 1/27/2021 |21| $18 | $348 |$329|\n| Trade Halt |1/28/2021|2/18/2021|21|$325|$41|$(284)|\n| DFV + 50k |2/19/2021|3/9/2021|18|$41|$236|$195|\n\nNext I looked at the price change related to volume for each Event.\n\nVolume / Price change = Volume / abs (Close price - Open price)\n\nabs = absolute value\n\nThis tells me how much volume was needed to change the price $1\n\nAs you can tell the amount of volume required to move the price during Event 3 is slightly less then Event 1. Also the amount of volume required to move the price during Event 2 is significantly less due to the trading halts imposed on retail investors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n| Event | Volume | Price Change | Volume / Price Change |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| Start | 1,108,040,000 | $329 | 3,366,368 |\n| Trade Halt | 569,480,000 | $(284) | 2,003,025 |\n| DFV + 50k | 624,115,325 | $195 | 3,193,876 |\n\nFinally I can calculate what my price target will be at the end of event 3 on 3/12/2021\n\nI look at how much volume I have left to go on event 3 based on Event 1\n\nVolume To-Go = Event 1 Volume - Event 2 Volume\n\nI then take my volume to go and divide that by how much volume it has taken during event 3 to move the stock $1\n\nVolume To-Go / Volume/Price change = (Event 1 Volume - Event 3 Volume) / (Event 3 Volume / Event 3 Close Price - Event 3 Open price)\n\nThis tell me how much I expect the stock to rise by the end Event 3 on 3/12/2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n| Volume To-Go | Volume To-Go / Volume/Price change | Current Price |Price Target for Friday 3/12/2021 |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| 483,924,675 | $152 | $236 | $388 |\n\nLastly, now that I have my expect price change I can calculate my PT for Friday 3/12/2021\n\n**Price Target for Friday 3/12/2021 = Current Price + (Volume To-Go / (Volume/Price change)) = $388**\n\nAll the Data shown above has been taken from 3 month charts ; except 3/9/2021 which was taken around 1:15 pm CST on 3/9/2021 once the day closes I can re run this model if need be. Also everything was rounded to the closest whole number.\n\nThe whole scenario here is still so unprecedented ; as more volume and price action takes place I can update my models accordingly and make adjustments. But as we get closer to the apex of price I really think we could start seeing $100 ,$1,000 , maybe even $10,000 mid day price swings in either direction.\n\nSome food for though that I might expand on later is so far during event 3 we are starting to see a smaller requirement of volume needed to change price. This separation could be a sign that significant price action could be taking place soon.\n\nThis is not financial advice ; I'm not a financial advisor ; I'm not saying to buy or sell.\n\n**But based on historical trends $388 is where I expect to see this stock come Friday 3/12/2021.**\n\nA little back ground about me I have a degree in Industrial Engineering and currently have a job as an earned value management analyst. I mostly deal with large amounts of actual and theoretical data to create statistical models to forecast labor and material needs for my company.",

        "selftext": "#TL;DR : If you sell at $1,000 in the hopes of a dip from a massive short attack, YOU'LL MISS THE SQUEEZE.\n\nI've now seen [multiple posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1j32k/beware_the_most_likely_hedge_fund_tactic_coming/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) of people claiming that the shorts will attack the stock heavily at $1,000 and bring it back down to sub-100 levels. And here's why I think this WON'T happen and might become the next shill tactic.\n\nFirst off, let's look back at the January pre-squeeze. The shorties had to *cheat* and TURN OFF the buy button to get the price down when it reached close to 500$. \n\n##Let me rephrase, Robinhood and others had to change the rules of the game in order to bail them out. \n\n#That's how fucked they were.\n\nThat leads me to believe that the shorters were on the brink of getting margin called around the $500-$800 price point.\n\nI've also seen plenty of DD on this sub that concluded that with the volume and price action in late Jan and February, there was no way the hedgies could have covered or repositioned their shorts. Therefore, the price at which they get margin called should still be the same. Now that the DTCC checks their balance every single day, it makes it even easier to margin call them.\n\nAdditionally, there was plenty of DD on the gamma squeezes and the **HUGE** number of call options open right now. This means that market makers could potentially buy millions of shares as the price goes higher and higher in order to delta hedge. \n\n#There's no way the hedgies can short millions of shares to bring the price down.\n\n1. They are already on the brink of getting margin called. \n2  The inverse correlation of $SPY with $GME suggests that they had to sell their other positions in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to hold onto their shorts and to pay the the interest on them.\n3. They simply don't have enough money to counter the INSANE bullish momentum we have right now.\n4. Do you really think that, if they had that kind of shorting power, if they could stop the momentum we're having, they wouldn't have just driven the price to the ground the past couple of weeks? they wouldn't have just shot the price down from $180 straight back to $20 and kept it there for a month? Here's my takeaway from the recent price movements: They're out of ammo. They are losing the fight and they know it. Therefore they now rely on desperate \"sell at $1k\" FUD and media blackout. They don't want it to squeeze even higher. But it will.\n\n##If you sell at 1k in the hopes of a short attack so that you can buy back in at a lower price, you'll miss the squeeze. \n\nThe price will skyrocket so fast from the market makers scrambling to get millions of shares, from the shorts forced to buy back millions of shares and from the thousands of retail investors FOMOing into the stock, that you'll just be left in the dust, with tiny gains, and huge regret.\n\n#Bottom line: if you sell before 500k, you'll be bagholding $REGRET for the rest of your life.\n\nThink about it: We've seen all the DD we could possibly want. Fundamental analysis says $GME is a strong buy. Technical analysis suggests $GME is going much much higher. $GME is shorted so fucking much that they will have to pay the price you want. \n\n##This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be greedy and change your life. Don't let it slip away.\n\nNow, why might those \"dip at 1k\" posts become shill tactics? Because they claim with confidence that there will be a dip at 1k. What's the effect? Newbies will try to get a quick day trade out of it, and sell their shares. Now, this little amount of selling will have basically no impact on the squeeze, but these apes will miss the squeeze, because there will be no dip... \n\nPlus, think about the risk you'd be taking: selling at 1k and buying back in at say 200 would only get you 800 bucks/share of profit. *But you're risking 499k/share of profit!!!* \n\n#It simply doesn't make sense from a risk/reward perspective to day trade $GME, no matter your risk tolerance.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to address is the fear that GameStop might raise money by issuing millions more shares and saving the shorties in the process. I've seen a few comments about this and Uncle Bruce thinks it might happen (as much as I like him, I think his theory will not happen simply from a logical point of view). (Also, don't hate on him, he's an honest guy and he even predicted the $GME short squeeze when it was at $4)\n\n*But heres why GameStop won't bail out the hedgies.*\n\nWhy would GameStop save the shorts who tried to bankrupt them with illegal naked shorting and maybe even more shady shit I'm not aware of? Why would GameStop issue shares at 1k or 10k when they know they could raise funds at 500k if they need the money? Why would GameStop stop a short squeeze that would benefit millions of retail investors?\n\n###GameStop's customers are Redditors. GameStop's customers are retail investors. They're not hedge funds. They're not market makers. They're not any other institution.\n\nIf they dilute their shares and help the shorts, they would only shoot themselves in the foot. They would face immense backlash, similar to Robinhood. They would lose the faith of millions of individuals/potential customers. They would NEVER recover from such a nearsighted action, and Ryan Cohen, as the (possibly) new CEO, will never let that happen. \n\n#So, sit tight, hold, and buy more if you can. \n\n*not financial advice*\n\nApe's equation:\n\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d + \ud83d\udc8e\u270b = \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15",

        "selftext": "Okay, for the record, I'm a novice investor and don't really fully know what I'm doing.\n\nI looked at my portfolio and.... It's bad. I realized some gains and flipped some money around and kept myself only 7% in the red. But I've got some holdings seriously deep in the red! Especially my Arks and QCLN. \n\nBeing new I'm sure you know where this goes, lol. \"Do I sell before I lose all my money??\" I calmed myself down and reminded myself I have high risk investments but they're mostly ETFs and are very unlikely to hit zero as they're being managed by people far smarter than me who are far greedier than me. \n\nSo I decided to read the news, not for answers but to just see if I notice any trends and red flags. And everything is just talking about a \"tech sell-off\" and a \"growth sell-off\" (which, duh?). But the interesting thing to me is there's really no discernable pattern. All they really got is \"Oh well Ford announced this so Tesla slipped, oh growth is down because growth is down.\" On Reddit I've heard about retirement accounts being rearranged, I've heard of big industries shorting to drive price down, I've heard people think a reopen will be this and that, I've heard it's a correction because those markets were in a bubble...\n\nBut I don't know. Something just feels like hysteria here. The fact boomer stocks are going up proportionately to tech going down has me suspicious. If tech is in a bubble and crashing because the price wasn't justified, what the hell's justifying the relatively large rise in banking and oil etc right now?? So are we just moving the \"bubble\" into a new industry?\n\nI feel like this could just be that boomers overgauged the impact our pandemic has been having on society over the last few months. I really don't think $BOA was somehow less valuable just because we had to wear masks, just to give an example. What world does tech suddenly lose value just because we can go to Pink Floyd cover band concerts with our grandchildren again, too? Better switch back to the good ol' reliables because we're going to shut off our phones and hug each other in a few months?\n\nWhen people realized they jumped the gun buying in on old money stocks, aren't they just going to buy back the same tech stocks they had before? What industry could they possibly hop to next? \n\nEven considering politics, this shit is weird and nonsensical! Why would tech advancements, green energy, etc hit an all time high during a regressive presidential administration and then become irrelevant? It's like people forget Biden will be president still after his 100 days and that he's just going to spend 4 years vaccinating us and nominating people. I'm not a fan of the guy but but green energy has been his headlining issue and I have a feeling as soon as \"Green New Deal\" is a headline again, my $QCLN will skyrocket before anything is even passed as people rush to buy back in to renewables. \n\nJust wanted to verbalize all of this to see if anyone else feels the same way - like this is some dumb sham being led by stubborn short sightedness and good old fashion boomer ludditism (and of course boosted by big dogs in the industry, no doubt). I feel like April will hit and we'll see another V shape tech recovery like we did during the pandemic's start because people realized they're too stuck on their old ways that are probably never fully returning.",

        "selftext": "AMC has in my opinion officially decoupled from GME. I don't see as many posts, or as many comments regarding the DD or discussions on the potentials AMC poses as a short squeeze target. It's sad to see how many of you disbanded for quick bucks on other shit tickers. \n\nHere are some cold facts about AMC:\n\n1. AMC Short Interest is now a whopping +10%\n2. The OI on options expiring 3/19 are ENORMOUS. The value is nearly HALF that of Apples.\n3. AMC is still a massively shorted stock, one of the most in the whole market. \n4. AMC is reopening dozens and dozens of cinemas tomorrow in many cities: one of the biggest being in San Francisco.\n5. The fucking FUNDAMENTALS haven't changed! AMC &amp; GME have ALWAYS been the cause. We LIKE these stocks. \n\n&gt;inb4 here are bearish hard cold facts on AMC.\n\nI just came back today from the cinema for the first time in a long ass time. And it felt GREAT. The feeling of having people laugh alongside you, the thrill of grabbing popcorn and sinking into the leather chairs, watching a new release on a big screen. Fuck the Netflix. That's for lazy zoomers who want instant depressing gratification. So fuck the bearish sentiment on AMC. I don't care. I support our cinemas with my cash, and will fucking HOLD until you apes eventually come back to your original mission. \n\nTLDR: Everyone seems to have forgotten about AMC to chase quick bucks on PLT, RKT, SKX and other shit tickers and have forgotten where they began. AMC is still not done. It never really began in the first place, yet. Stay the course.",

        "selftext": "#  Intro\n\nWelcome, and I hope everyone is fresh for a new day of holding because things seem to be getting interesting now. My take on this DD is a bit different to my usual format as I've decided to focus on the Technical analysis side of GME this time around. Why? Because you apes couldn't contemplate words so now I'm using colourful crayons and pictures instead. As always, I've inserted a TLDR for the autists but I do recommend reading it since it'll also help grow your knowledge of TA.\n\n# Pivot Point\n\nThe pivot **point, support and resistance calculations are widely accepted as the simplest yet most effective trading strategy.** They are well trusted by traders, banks and all financial institutions as clear indicators of the strength or weakness of the market. *They are used as the basis for most technical analysis*. **The pivot point is the point in which the market sentiment changes from bearish to bullish.**\n\nFor example, let's look at the candlestick chart for a ticker that I took from tradingview,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img cdv56c1km0m61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nR1 = (2 x Pivot Point) \u2013 Daily Low\n\nR2 = Pivot Point + (Daily High \u2013 Daily Low)\n\nS1 = (2 x Pivot Point) \u2013 Daily High\n\nS2 = Pivot Point \u2013 (Daily High \u2013 Daily Low)\n\n*R3 = Daily High + 2 x (Pivot Point \u2013 Daily Low)*\n\n*S3 = Daily Low \u2013 2 x (Daily High \u2013 Pivot Point)*\n\n**LINKING BACK TO GME**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Pivot Point Data were taken from Investing.com](https://preview.redd.it/rbjrco9nm0m61.jpg?width=976&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f917346de8cdbbc3f5e333edb8b6073831cd1a9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGME-\n\nResistance Line 1: $195.13\n\nResistance Line 2: 202.33\n\nResistance Line 3: 215.87\n\n*While writing this post $GME was hovering around $217* in pre-market (Which is higher than the current R3 value), all though the value is bound to change before the market opens, if $215 can be maintained during the opening; that **will ultimately see Resistance Level 3 becoming the new support line. This would depict a very strong bullish trend that can be aided by the RSI (Relative strength index)**\n\n*You can ignore the Fibonacci, camarilla etc PP if you're new to TA but they basically show the same trend of the ticker having an uptrend.*\n\n# Relative Strength Index\n\n*The relative strength index (RSI) is a* *momentum indicator* *used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions* in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100\n\nRSI below 30: Oversold, will rebound and may show divergence\n\nAbove 70: Overbought\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME RSI between march 4th and 8th](https://preview.redd.it/7ropbgzsm0m61.jpg?width=1201&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c7ae49ff044332e81020f8404647aa973073a99)\n\nCurrent GME RSI value: 68 (Neutral)\n\n*The data shows RSI value continuing in an uptrend (bullish) and is in line with the price of $GME as no divergence could be seen. Coupling it with the pivot points, if the same trend continues today and tomorrow we'll see a breakout and support lines forming around $215+*\n\n**Disclaimer: My predictions are just me speculating and do not necessarily mean they are right. The increased volatility with low float means the price could go in any directions. But the indicators seem to be showing a healthy direction for a bullish market.**\n\n**Now comparing this to the RSI before January squeeze:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[RSI before jan squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/8otntoxum0m61.jpg?width=455&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fda45bc0fd98a78cea2e04d90c88ed9187a36d91)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRSI Value: 72.14\n\nAs seen from the second image, RSI trend before the breakout was in an uptrend. However, the slope was not as steep as we're currently seeing right now and when the price really started getting high, RSI showed a massive overbought. Comparing this back to the march RSI, that trend is still in the neutral territory and has potential for a more violent uptick as RSI value reaches the 70-75+ region.\n\n# Volume Weighted Average Price\n\nThe volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price security has traded throughout the day, based on both volume and price.\u00a0*It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of security.* Large institutional buyers and mutual funds use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. **This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.**\n\n*VWAP calculates the sum of price multiplied by volume, divided by total volume.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[VWAP January 13th-22nd](https://preview.redd.it/jcps124xm0m61.jpg?width=131&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67dbb4877f7fa69b17429839bfa967c605d2b08d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img s2sqhq2ym0m61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Blue Line indicates the volume-weighted average price. **Comparing both pictures, the vwap value in regards to each candlestick seems to show the same pattern.**\n* VWAP has been above the average day trading price between 6 and 7th March, this seems to act like the support line for the price.\n* **8th march and 22nd January show a similar pattern, both had a relatively significant increase in (=increased volatility and more violent price swings) as well as a positive slope gradient.**\n\n# Moving Average Convergence Divergence\n\nMACD is a trend-following [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security\u2019s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period [exponential moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the \"signal line,\" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. **Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MACD january](https://preview.redd.it/akhuo1g1n0m61.jpg?width=311&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32ae04bfcde02eb35d592de58a87f48053cda122)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MACD march](https://preview.redd.it/l0cu7ez2n0m61.jpg?width=553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b836600d1bb2bac2c97aa6a10a97607381532f8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) which graphs the distance between the MACD and its signal line. If the MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD\u2019s baseline.\n\n* **MACD in January showed a gradual increase till breakout, the march macd value is much stronger in regards to the trend and can see the signal line deviating away from the EM**A. Linking it back to the RSI uptrend, trend seems to be bullish and does not show any signs of divergence. *Outcome? Will probably continue this trend for the days to come*\n\n# Other Indicators\n\nSince I ran out of time and probably you apes have ran out of patience as well, I'm just going to list the other moving averages indications to summarise the trends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Indicator Values taken from trading view](https://preview.redd.it/dt8dgbo4n0m61.jpg?width=663&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=178b8def7cf54223bb626d78f7be1187159e0bd4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TLDR\n\n**Most (If not all) Moving average indicators show a very strong bullish market on a DAY scale as we can see the trend to continue to follow an uptrend. The Resistance level 3 pivot points may become the new support live if the RSI+MACD trend continues. Neither show divergence which is also a good sign.**\n\nAnyways hope I've cleared some things out, and if the DD needs correction then please feel free to let me know so i can fix/include the data. **This is my last DD to the series and hope it has benefited people, I'll be taking some time off now to snort coke,** ***bon voyage*** **apes!**\n\n\\*Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving financial advice.

        "selftext": "**TL;DR UNFI is going to bull run all the way to March 10 as there are 7 days to cover before pandemic earnings drop a nuke on the shorts.**\n\nInspired by the RKT earnings events last week, here\u2019s the DD on a similar situation with UNFI upcoming earnings. Where do we start with this stock. It is basically trading at the same price as it did in late 2018 and 65% off its highs in 2015. Being in the grocery business during a pandemic, last earnings were amazing as it reported 6% increase in net sales, 31% increase in EBITDA, and 1,175% increase in EPS.\n\n[Strong Start to Fiscal 2021](https://preview.redd.it/c939za9eeuk61.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf609c0fbb9f23dad7154bd08888a77544a0ea79)\n\nUNFI is strong financially, with about $21 per share on the books (P/B ratio 1.3), current PE ratio of about 13 and expected to go even lower as they keep reporting pandemic earnings. Using those earnings to pay off debt way ahead of schedule and strengthening their financial position further.\n\nSo what\u2019s the short interest? The answer - around 22%. If you look at the low trading volume, 12.5M shares short with 7 days to cover, average volume is about 1.5M. As of posting this volume is **201,857**. Low float of 52M shares. Since 90% of the float is locked away by institutions, shares for trade are even fewer. And what\u2019s 7 days from now? Another pandemic earnings call. There\u2019s not enough volume during the day to cover all those shares. The last earnings time this happened, the stock doubled and now in 2021 short interest is at all time highs. Hate to say it, but COVID has been very good to UNFI.\n\n[UNFI Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/gwiq16skeuk61.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8610a098dab6413d2bbd1eced4dcac176113be58)\n\nI could talk about how inflation is rising and how that impacts the price of groceries, but that\u2019s not why I think the stock will rise in the next 7 days.\n\nEarnings scheduled for the **morning of  March 10** and there is a good chance for fatal blows to the shorts. Be it the announcement of:\n\n* **Amazon Deal** \u2013 to be the exclusive supplier to all Whole Foods locations\n* **Property Sales** \u2013 their retail business (Cub Foods) or unused real estate (underutilized distribution centers) to strengthen balance sheet and pay off more debt\n* **New CEO Replacement**  \u2013  last year confirmed that current CEO will be retiring in July 2021 and a new CEO will be announced early 2021\n\nA large short interest with 7 days to cover right on earnings day would give an insane rise. I would anticipate 60%+ to mid 40s or even higher. This would make the market cap only 2.5B (up from 1.5B) for a company that has sales of 27B. **No other company has a revenue to market cap ratio that high!** UNFI used to be in the 40s in 2018 and hit an all-time-high of $80 back when its revenue was only 8B in 2015. Now revenues are 3x higher, but the stock is 3x lower.\n\nUNFI is recruiting diamond hands. Shorts don't want to see the army of autists and apes gunning for 100%.\n\n**I like the stock. Buy shares, squeeze shorts, and make money.**\n\nDisclosure: I\u2019m hard for UNFI and put my money where my mouth is with [$400K](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls8hs7/unfi_united_natural_foods_yolo_update_february_25/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) in the stock. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**EDIT 1**: Will send daily updates leading to earnings and a post-earnings update.\n\nMarch 3, YOLO [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx0rlv/unfi_yolo_preearnings_update_march_3_2021_diamond/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nMarch 4, YOLO [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxw5me/unfi_yolo_preearnings_update_march_4_2021_diamond/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n**EDIT 2**: Holy shit Amazon deal was announced the day after posting this!

        "selftext": "You've probably heard the news by now that 6 Dr Seuss books will no longer be published for imagery that has been deemed racist. Regardless of your political beliefs, we're all here to make MONEY. Basic supply and demand indicates that discontinued books will skyrocket in value if demand increases. Sure enough, within two days, these banned Dr Seuss books are now worth their weight in [fucking gold](https://www.cbr.com/dr-seuss-banned-books-sell-high-pries-seconday-market/).\n\nHere's a breakdown by numbers. I'm using data from Barnes and Noble online to establish the normal hardcover price, and then the lowest price on Amazon to establish approximate selling price after it was announced that they will no longer be published:\n\n* The Cat's Quizzer\n   * $9.99 ---&gt; $499.99 **(4,905% increase)**\n* If I Ran the Zoo\n   * $17.99 ---&gt; $594.00 **(3,202% increase)**\n* On Beyond Zebra\n   * $16.99 ---&gt; $425.25 **(2,403% increase)**\n* Scrambled Eggs Super\n   * $14.75 ---&gt; $325.00 **(2,103% increase)**\n* McElligot's Pool\n   * $19.99 ---&gt; $325.00 **(1,526% increase)**\n* And to Think That I Saw it on Mulberry Street\n   * $16.99 ---&gt; $224.25 **(1,220% increase)**\n\nEvery single one of these is a literal ten-bagger. What's even more crazy is that this [Insider article](https://www.insider.com/classic-childrens-books-that-havent-aged-well-2019-5#if-i-ran-the-zoo-by-theodor-seuss-geisel-aka-dr-seuss-has-been-criticized-for-containing-numerous-offensive-images-1) sort of called it almost two years ago\u2014the first book on their list is If I Ran the Zoo. In addition to the above mentioned Insider article, I looked through several lists of books that are being challenged for racial content. My analysis leads me to believe that *The Indian in the Cupboard* by Lynne Reid Banks, currently being published by Harper Collins, is a prime candidate for a discontinued book squeeze. Here's why:\n\n1. **Low Search Volume**. Here's a Google trends graph of how often the recalled Dr Seuss books were searched for on Amazon. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d178buhtl2l61.png?width=2322&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ad443bc373d439abe34e87d8fbd8c8d04ffd32a\n\nNotice how there's nobody trying to buy these books? This makes sense. No publisher in their right mind would discontinue a popular children's book. This is why books like *The Cat in the Hat* or *Peter Pan*, which have also been criticized, will never go out of print. It would be a financial nightmare.\n\nIn contrast, look at how Indian in the Cupboard stacks up against some other contenders:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xe9dbpun2l61.png?width=2306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01e3995810de807ae599684cd690ba7efc2149b7\n\nIf you follow the red trendline, you will see that searches for \"Indian in the Cupboard Amazon\" are effectively 0 with some slight upticks every now and then. This contrasts with Amazon searches for titles like Little House on the Prairie, which sees consistent search frequency. Discontinuing further printings of The Indian in the Cupboard will probably have little impact on HarperCollins' margins.\n\n2. **Broad readership base, particularly among middle-aged readers.** In addition to being discontinued, a book will need to have excess demand before the price will surge. This will happen only if the book has a broad readership base. In Dr Seuss's case, so many adults have probably read at least one of the 6 discontinued books growing up (hell I loved Mulberry Street when I was little), which is why they're actually buying up these books now that they've become limited edition items. It probably helps that Dr Seuss wrote his books to help children read and literally every elementary school still uses his writing to teach literacy skills.\n\nSimilarly, *The Indian in the Cupboard* was actually well-received in the 80s and was incorporated into school curriculums nationwide. You can still find entire teaching guides built around *The Indian in the Cupboard*, and I distinctly remember reading this book and filling out worksheets back in third grade 2009. Yeah, this book isn't as popular as it once was, but I'm willing to bet that in the 40 years that it's been out, it's been able to build a solid fanbase of readers who will buy a copy out of nostalgia once this book gets banned. This also gives *The Indian in the Cupboard* an advantage over books like *Pippi Longstocking,* which\u2014despite being a children's book with low search volume\u2014is beloved in Sweden but has a much smaller audience in America.\n\n3. **History of contentious debate.** The controversy over Dr Seuss's books didn't just happen overnight (although it certainly felt that way). His books have been banned in libraries for years and there are [arguments](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/reckoning-dr-seuss-racist-imagery-has-been-years-making-n1259330) going all the way back to the 90s about whether his books are racist. This is the same situation that *The Indian in the Cupboard* finds itself in. It's been removed from numerous public libraries and the American Library Association leadership advised educators to avoid the book as far back as 1991. This is important because the decision to remove books is typically time-sensitive. Given almost 30 years to consider whether or not to discontinue publishing, Harper Collins likely has enough financial data and a good picture of consumer preferences, especially under the current political climate, to decide that they will stop further publications of *The Indian in The Cupboard*. \n\nIt's important to keep in mind that there is significantly less liquidity with trading books than stocks. However, books are still less volatile and, like art pieces, tend to appreciate in value over time. I think that *The Indian in the Cupboard* is a long-term hold which has the potential to increase ten fold when it inevitably gets pulled from circulation.",

        "selftext": "Okay so here are my thoughts. Behind Nestle, PepsiCo is the biggest company in it's sector by revenue. It also follows Coke stock fairly closely. But what made the difference this last year was how these two comparable soda giants fared during covid 19.\n\nKO or Coke performed extremely poorly and made less money yoy. It's payout ratio for its dividend was touching 94%. Meaning they only had 6% left over after paying out their shareholders. That's not a lot of money to do much of anything with. ESPECIALLY in an industry that needs to move towards new products with the decline in popularity of Soda.\n\nTo compare with PepsiCo, which even during the pandemic found a way to make more revenue in 2020 than in 2019.\n\nTo give you specific numbers, in 2018 was an increase in total revenue by 1.79% compared to 2017. In 2019 it increased 3.87% compared to 2018, and in 2020 increased a 4.78% which might I remind you that this increase happened during the pandemic. Now why did PepsiCo do well against their main rival coke?\n\nTo answer this in simple terms their portfolio was more diversified than coke's and they focused on releasing new and more popular products as well as packaged food which saw a huge boost in sales from \"Toilet Paper Bandits\" or panic shoppers stocking up on bags of fritos, lays, cheetos, and on the healthier side of things Quaker Oats and other products. Until recently most people thought coke stock was king between the two companies but I believe 2020 may have put pepsi on the podium as our clear winner of the Cola Wars.\n\nPepsi has a dividend yield of 3.12% and a payout ratio of 79.88%\n\nCoke has a dividend yield of 3.35% and a payout ratio of 93.85%\n\nWith the payout ratios so high I am a little concerned for dividend increases for both but I would be shocked if coke raised it any more than they had to to keep their dividend status.\n\nShare price:\n\nI see PepsiCo valued at $154.36 a share\nTrevis Evaluation puts then at $150.16 which I believe is low but close to a 20 dollar per share increase or more either way.\n\nThis is an upside of 18.46% not including dividends.\n\nAnd I calculated Coke to be valued at $52.72 a share.\nTrevis Evaluation puts it at $55.48 which is more than I calculated.\n\nTaking the higher of the two numbers this leave a share price upside of around 11.00%\n\nThere are many other reasons I believe Pepsi is going to be the better long term pick like how they released the new cocktail mixers neon Zebra (which I would love to try) to take some of the cocktail mixer marketshare. Which the mixer market tops 858 MM$ and an industry that grew 35% just last year. Cocktail culture is coming to North America and in the United States and Canada we are heavily accepting these delicious mixers that are premade and easy to make.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these two companies or their sectors in general? Do you think PepsiCo is undervalued? Or do you think Coke is still a better buy? Let me know in the comments.\n\nDisclaimer: I am Long PepsiCo and hold positions in the stock mentioned above.",
