        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # WSB Learns Ch 3: The Cloud Environment (Draft)\n\n# # About Me\n\nI'm a Mexican American software engineer in the fintech industry (US) and avocado farmer (Mexico).  I have 8 years working in a manufacturing, fintech, and education policy. My economic research and model largely revolves around increasing Mexican-American trade after USMCA changes and I write around organizations that will be affected by Mexican development and American innovation. I write extensively because I love to teach online, debate, and learn a few things myself in the process.\n\n* Digital Transactions\n* Cybersecurity\n* Cross-border Trade\n* Agricultural Technology\n* Manufacturing support\n* Labor laws &amp; IP/data protection\n\nSome of these picks are abundantly clear. For example:\n\n1. Nucor Steel will see operations grow\n2. Kansas City Southern Rail is a critical supply chain element\n3. Paypal and Square will continue to build financial services in underbanked nations like Mexico.\n4. Cloudflare will offer unbelievably inexpensive cybersecurity and networking support\n5. Texas Instruments will build advanced manufacturing technology based on computer vision\n6. **Dropbox will continue to expand tooling in academia, camera and signature solutions, and data storage in an era of advanced data collection &amp; computing.**\n7. Institutions and financieers are investing in logistics and data center real estate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# DBX 24-26c 8/21\n\n# DBX 24c 9/18\n\n[https://assets-global.website-files.com/580ea75512564ed05c3a8455/5bfc62c5aca97fa17998085e\\_dropbox-blog-image-1434x590.jpg](https://assets-global.website-files.com/580ea75512564ed05c3a8455/5bfc62c5aca97fa17998085e_dropbox-blog-image-1434x590.jpg)\n\n# # My Belief\n\n**Dropbox is in the right place at the right time, much like a recycled cardboard boxing company is in logistics.** Cloud computing is complex and Big Tech will antitrust and decoupling pressures as time goes on. These companies are not stupid and are able to survive the change by decentralizing and consolidating over time. Telecom, oil, and other industries have done this in the past. However, this is probably the weakest factor in Dropbox's position.\n\nThe simple truth is that the marketshare of files and file processing is fucking huge and it's possible to grow at a respectable rate despite the fact that iCloud, Google Drive, and AWS S3 exists.  There are banking, manufacturing, and other data processors that require this shit and it's the same reason you're seeing organizations like ZScaler grow.\n\n* Adobe has a strong grasp on video, animated, and drawn files\n* Dropbox blessed legions of academics with window-mac file problems\n* Microsoft has made an enormous change by acquiring software engineering files via Github and NPM, which leverages them further into software automation with Softomotive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*We focus particularly on the use cases that are complementary. And we see ourselves as playing an important role in terms of taking a couple steps back and making sure the overall experience is coherent. More than we're trying to engage in a dogfight with any particular tool or facet of the experience.* \\- Dropbox CEO\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oodnkwv4q5c51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd6c45b7abd0d7db7b89d6540896cb40e218abd0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6aqbxas5q5c51.jpg?width=2716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9655de09d81bba1c11d14a6b71a7b94b05c591\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pinsndv6q5c51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1d162b2f7b72a356b86a8ed6be5365c21a0de83\n\nI actually view Dropbox closer to Adobe and DocuSign, but much more of a longterm cloud infrastructure layer rather than a sexy app that enhances the experience of using devices like iPad Pros and such.\n\nYou can do a lot of cool shit with files and I'm sure that the leadership behind DropBox is highly cognizant of the possibilities behind legal software, contract security, signature software, transactions, and other critical supply chain elements like academic management, IT support, and a financially robust competitor that institutions are happy to purchase stake in. This is file tooling and it's a big fucking industry that will be empowered by AI, computer vision, data processing, and the real estate of large data centers.\n\nIm making this over simplified, but the IT world is structured in layers. This extends from your router to your internet provider's telecommunication. You can imagine that organizations like Cloudflare &amp; Dropbox exist in separate layers under the same idea.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8np7stlg5c51.png?width=3518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc38df1402a4220c8beccdeb3d467bf27847b3e9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tso1caia5c51.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98513757632de2d7900842a2ace2951be58c7360\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2401iz3oa5c51.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a697cbc38f89c84c7150c7fc8102778a6f3bb14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p47zwp8os5c51.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=486885d26d0b1122738df569e2accae89bc5ce22\n\n# # Why Dropbox?\n\nIn short, DropBox is wildly popular among\n\n\\- Academics\n\n\\- Accountants\n\n\\- HR teams\n\n\\- Deep Technology relationships over the past decade (early Spotify, startups, app integrations)\n\n\\- Anyone that has to deal with a fuck ton of files all of the time.\n\nDropbox is very similar to Cloudflare. It has taken years of careful development, relationship building, and investor confidence before going public on a highly distributed, robust, and cost effective technology for both Enterprise and SMB level users. They are technologists that know how to build a business.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ik5t8m7h65c51.png?width=1247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4e2d7fa558823f75e4cf80dfaa295eebdbe83ba\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dropbox Marketshare in Mexico](https://preview.redd.it/riv24qhq65c51.png?width=2989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2df4b27406cbf8863e1eeabd1a2676d7c510740d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2019 - Dropbox acquires HelloSign &amp; HelloWorks to manage legal contracts, signatures, and business needs.](https://preview.redd.it/2a05uwk385c51.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41db97e6bad427fe7d6428ea36e6a7ff81798095)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[DropBox is known for being financially consistent. ](https://preview.redd.it/v7hreqc985c51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dbd9e369864b58c618640dc83f2b7b817c81f54)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ",

It's a rapidly growing product that I believe will protect interests as Latin America develops. I believe that their development of privacy-focused serverless computing and video streaming infrastructure was what was necessary for it to experience enormous growth in the next few years.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/) \n\n\\- **Corteva - AGRICULTURE BIOTECH**\n\nCorteva is a powerfully focused agritech investment. They have deep investments in corn, which is an enormous product that will always persist in Mexico and US agriculture.\n\n [https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening) \n\n\\- **Facebook - E-COMMERCE**\n\nI believe Facebook will play a really interesting role with Canada's Shopify in Latin America. WhatsApp is enormously popular in Mexico due to Facebook's networking investments, making it cheap to use. WhatsApp is better suited for Mexico's barter style economy, while Instagram seems to serve America's ad-centric transactions better. I believe we will be seeing Facebook develop deep business support with Shopify that is easy to use for billions of people across different economies.  Some of the technology is actually faschinating, as you can purchase products and test products using filters and 1-swipe purchases.\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/business/shops](https://www.facebook.com/business/shops) \n\n**- Kansas City Southern - US-MEXICAN RAIL**\n\nKansas City Southern is an extremely important trade vector between Mexico and the US. In particular, Texas and Monterrey. It's well diversified to deliver at a cost effective rate between changes in agriculture, energy, automotive, machining, food, and more.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf\\_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Adobe - GRAPHICS**\n\nI'm completely impressed by Adobe's growth and acquisitions across multiple sectors. I believe Adobe is a great longterm AR play as it maintains a close relationship with Apple, develops software for video games, movies, digital signatures, and e-commerce, architecture, design, and an endless array of other software solutions.\n\n [https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Paypal - FINANCIAL ACCESS**\n\nPaypal is interesting in regards to US-Mexico.Paypal has always demonstrated itself as a pioneer. It's very easy to send remittance money through Xoom. It's easy to send money to your friends via Venmo. Their credit system is awfully fair, which is helpful in a nation like Mexico that's critically underbanked. \n\nThey also had an excellent acquisition with Honey. I believe they'll be generating billions through their transactions on Amazon and other industries and will force fintech to rethink how far financial technology can go.\n\n [https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:\\~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Texas Instruments  - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS**\n\nI've selected for TI over AMD and Nvidia  since TI has a greater distribution. You'll find TI in automobiles, space rockets, airplanes, CNCs, school calculators, concrete producers, and so on.  Either way, AMD is listed below as a supplement to an already cloud-heavy setup.\n\n [https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx) \n\n\\- **Teradyne - SYSTEMS TESTING &amp; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION**\n\nTeradyne is part of the COVID restructure. I believe networking hardware chips are only  going to be more needed as an economic driver. Teradyne has an excellent client base regarding that and also develops and impressive amount of industrial automation robots across warehouses, farms, and so on. The future is inevitably automation, and this is my participation in that.\n\n [https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/](https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/) \n\n\\- **Microsoft - SOFTWARE AUTOMATION**\n\nI'm really excited to see Microsoft's future in software automation and services. They have a really interesting position with regards to gaming, cloud computing, and wonderful acquisitions for Github &amp; NPM and an array of other tools that can perform intensive software automation.\n\n [https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/) \n\n\\- **Costco - QUALITY CONSUMER GOODS**\n\nCostco has an excellent selection process that can be replicated across multiple cultures. The business pays their customers well which in turn results in supreme customer service and care.\n\n [https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/](https://futurefuel.io/employee-benefits/costco-careers/) \n\n\\- **Berkshire.B - QUALITY BUSINESSES**\n\nBerkshire.B is selected for similar reasons to Costco. I'm excited for Abel's leadership in the 21st century and they're simply an elegant long term investment with respects to quality business selection.\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/the-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio) \n\n\\- **XLB Materials ETF - PROCESS ENGINEERING**\n\nXLB has an excellent selection of dominant businesses with respects to their industry like Sherwin-Williams, Linde PLC, and Ecolab.\n\n [https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings](https://www.sectorspdr.com/sectorspdr/sector/xlb/holdings) \n\n\\- **Tesla - FUTURE MANUFACTURING**\n\nTesla is interesting as it develops robust applications and development of EV batteries, battery solutions, industrial automation and is helmed by a person who is able to mine engineering resources and relationships from SpaceX.\n\n [https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/](https://electrek.co/2020/06/17/tesla-new-deal-panasonic-battery-supply/) \n\n\\- **AMD - COMPUTING ACCESSIBILITY**\n\nI feel that the name of the game for AMD is the ability to reduce energy costs and low the cost of computing. They have been excelling at this for years now and I believe this patience will pay off enormously as AMD conquers the maintenance of data centers around the world.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-of-why-cloudflare-chose-amd-epyc-for-gen-x-servers/)",

They went from about 8% ownership to 15.7% ownership from May to July. They did all these purchases on the open market and the stock pretty much went up 60% following these trades. Recently anytime the stock went below $7 the insider bought the shares. They release earnings end of July/early August historically. \n\nThe insider bought shares after Q1 earnings in May (the numbers were terrible) and are still buying them as of July 9th. I guess they technically could say they were buying them because they liked the Q1 earnings but if the earnings in Q2 are great, couldn\u2019t they be hit with insider trading since they were really buying throughout Q2? \n\nOr perhaps the buyout rumors from Adobe are true and they get bought out at a higher valuation. Wouldn\u2019t this also come out as insider trading? \n\nI guess my question/discussion is how much of a time window between the purchases and news is needed in order for any type of purchases from a 10% or higher owner to not be illegal insider trading?\n\nEdit: for more information this insider inventor also has a board seat.

The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.
