Everything I am hearing is the state systems are down and I highly doubt that the 3.2 million number is all encompassing.

        "selftext": "This is the principle I've invested on, this is the principle I've thrived on.\n\nIn early 2007, there were many of us who could clearly see a storm was coming. When you've got people saying things like *\"they aren't making any new land, real estate can only go up forever!\"* you know you've got irrational greed on your hands. And so I sold in 2006 and held 100% cash, because you should be fearful when others are greedy. And when the market tanked, I printed tendies. Just as many of you are printing tendies now.\n\nBut after that precipitous drop in Oct. 2008, I turned around and began buying stock. Why? Because the sentiment of the market had changed. Because you should be greedy when others are fearful. I held that stock until 2018 and sold for another massive profit.\n\nNow we are seeing a near identical repeat of 2008. The bears have been rewarded for fearing the greed of the bulls. But things can turn around quickly. At some point bears become the greedy party, betting WITH the fear. People are still buying puts after a 30% down market. We've got people on sub predicting a complete financial meltdwn, millions ded, a new GD... I mean, anything is possible, but if you are betting on that, your greed is getting the best of you.\n\n**The point is to be neither a bear nor a bull, but a general contrarian of extremes in the market.** For the past several days, the extreme sentiment is clearly bearish, just as the extreme sentiment was extremely bullish a year ago.\n\nYou all have printed your tendies, but now you are getting greedy. Fear has taken over the market, and so now I am buying that fear. I am converting from a gay bear to a bull, starting this week.\n\nSure, the market will very likely continue to drop in the coming weeks or so... I will buy my way back in gradually, because I know I can't perfectly time the bottom. **The goal isn't to maximize every possible percent move of the market. Chasing that dream will make anyone broke.** The goal is to trade contrarian to market extremes. This week the market has become extreme bearish, and so I am reservedly bullish.\n\n**TL;DR - Your puts are still safe, but stop buying them. I'm not even buying calls, just going LONG on todays drop. And with every red day, I will be buying more, until the money is all gone.**",

        "selftext": "I'm a Loan Officer for one of the larger retail lenders. Here\u2019s an overview of how the Fed gone and fucked over mortgage lenders. \n\nTHE CORONAVIRUS MELTDOWN\nThe current coronavirus crisis is having a critical impact on the mortgage industry, which could potentially make the 2008 financial crisis pale in comparison. The pressing issue centers around capital that's required by Mortgage Lenders to be able to function and meet covenants that are required for them to continue to lend. \n\nHERES HOW THE MORTGAGE MARKET WORKS\nLet's begin with the mortgage process. A borrower goes to a Mortgage Originator to obtain a mortgage. Once closed, the loan is handled by a Servicer, which may or may not be the same company that originated the loan. The borrower submits payments to the Servicer, however, the Servicer does not own the loan, they are simply maintaining the loan. This means collecting payments and forwarding them to the investor (Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie), paying taxes and insurance, and answering questions, etc. While they maintain or \"service\" the loan, the asset itself is sold to an aggregator or directly to a government agency like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. The loan then gets placed in a large bundle, which is put in the hands of an Investment Banker. The Investment Banker converts those loans into a Mortgage Backed Security (MBS) that can be sold to the public. This shows up in different investments like Mutual Funds, Insurance Plans, and Retirement Accounts. \n\nThe Servicer's role is very critical. In order to obtain the right to service loans, the Servicer will typically pay 1% of the loan amount up front. The Servicer then receives a monthly payment or \"strip\" equal to about 30 basis points (bps) per year. Because they paid about 1% to obtain the servicing rights and receive roughly 30 bps annual income, the breakeven period is approximately 3 years. The longer that loan remains on the books, the more money the Servicer makes. In many cases, the Servicer may want to use leverage to increase their level of income. Therefore, they may often finance half the cost of acquiring the loan and pay the rest in cash. \n\nSERVICER DILEMMA\nAs you can imagine, when interest rates drop dramatically, there is an increased incentive for many people to refinance their loans more rapidly. This causes the loans that a Servicer had on their books to pay off sooner\u2026often before that 3-year breakeven period. This servicing runoff creates losses for that Mortgage Lender who is servicing the loan. The more loans in a Mortgage Lender\u2019s portfolio, the greater the loss. Servicing runoff, or even the anticipation of it, can adversely impact the market valuation of a servicing portfolio. But at the same time, Lenders typically experience an increase in new loan activity because of the decline in interest rates. This gives them additional income to help overcome the losses in their servicing portfolio. \n\nBut the Coronavirus has caused a virtual shutdown of the US economy, which has created an unprecedented amount of job losses. This adds a new risk to the servicer because borrowers may have difficulty paying their mortgage in a timely manner. And although the Servicer does not own the asset, they have the responsibility to make the payment to the investor, even if they have not yet received it from the borrower. Under normal circumstances, the Servicer has plenty of cushion to account for this. But an extreme level of delinquency puts the Servicer in an unmanageable position.\n\nI'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HERE TO HELP\nIn the Government\u2019s effort to help those who have lost their jobs because of the Coronavirus shutdown, they have granted forbearance of mortgage payments for affected individuals. This presents an enormous obstacle for Servicers who are obligated to forward the mortgage payment to the investor, even though they have not yet received it. Fortunately, there is a new facility set up to help Mortgage Servicers bridge the gap to the investor. However, it is unclear as to how long it will take for Servicers to access this facility.\n\nBut what has not been yet contemplated is the fact that a borrower who does not make their first mortgage payment causes the loan to be ineligible to be sold to an investor. This means that the Servicer must hold onto the asset itself, which ties up their available credit. And with so many new loans being originated of late, the amount of transactions that will not qualify for sale is significant. This restricts the Lender\u2019s ability to clear their pipeline and get reimbursed with cash so they can now fund new transactions.\n\nMARK TO MARKET\nThis week - Due to accelerated prepayments and the uncertainty of repayment, the value of servicing was slashed in half from 1% to 0.5%. This drastic decrease in value prompted margin calls for the many Servicers who financed their acquisition of servicing. Additionally, the decreased value of a Lender\u2019s servicing portfolio reduces the Lender\u2019s overall net worth. Since the amount a lender can lend is based on a multiple of their net worth, the decrease in value of their servicing portfolio asset, along with the cash paid for margin calls, reduces their capacity to lend.\n\nUNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES\nThe Fed\u2019s desire to bring mortgage rates down isn\u2019t just damaging servicing portfolios because of prepayments, it\u2019s also wreaking chaos in Lenders\u2019 ability to hedge their risk. Let\u2019s look at what happens when a borrower locks in their mortgage rate with a Mortgage Lender. Mortgage rates are based on the trading of Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). As Mortgage Backed Securities rise in price, interest rates improve and move lower. A locked rate on a loan is nothing more than a lender promising to hold an interest rate for a period of time, or until the transaction closes. The Lender is at risk for any MBS price changes in the marketplace between the time they agreed to grant the lock and the time that the loan closes.\n\nIf rates were to rise because MBS prices declined, the Lender would be obligated to buy down the borrower\u2019s mortgage rate to the level they were promised. And since the Lender doesn\u2019t want to be in a position of gambling, they hedge their locked loans by shorting Mortgage Backed Securities. Therefore, should MBS drop in price, causing rates to rise, the Lender\u2019s cost to buy down the borrower\u2019s rate is offset by the Lender\u2019s gains of their short positions in MBS.\n\nNow think about what happens when MBS prices rise or improve, causing mortgage rates to decline. On paper the Lender should be able to close the mortgage loan at a better price than promised to the borrower, giving the Lender additional profits. However, the Lender\u2019s losses on their short position negate any additional profits from the improvement in MBS pricing. This hedging system works well to deliver the borrower what was promised, while removing market risk from the Lender.\n\nBut in an effort to reduce mortgage rates, the Fed has been purchasing an incredible amount of Mortgage Backed Securities, causing their price to rise dramatically and swiftly. This, in turn, causes the Lenders\u2019 hedged short positions of MBS to show huge losses. These losses appear to be offset on paper by the potential market gains on the loans that the lender hopes to close in the future. But the Broker Dealer will not wait on the possibility of future loans closing and demands an immediate margin call. The recent amount that these Lenders are paying in margin calls are staggering. They run in the tens of millions of Dollars. All this on top of the aforementioned stresses that Lenders are having to endure. So, while the Fed believes they are stimulating lending, their actions are resulting in the exact opposite. The market for Government Loans, Jumbo Loans, and loans that don\u2019t fit ideal parameters, have all but dried up. And many Lenders have no choice but to slow their intake of transactions by throttling mortgage rates higher and by reducing the term that they are willing to guarantee a rate lock.\n\nFurthering the Fed\u2019s unintended consequences was the announcement to cut interest rates on the Fed Funds Rate by 1% to virtually zero. Because the Fed\u2019s communication failed to educate the general public that the Fed Funds Rate is very different than mortgage rates, it prompted borrowers in process to break their locks and try to jump ship to a lower rate. This dramatically increased hedging losses from loans that didn\u2019t end up closing.\n\nEVEN STEPHEN KING COULD NOT HAVE SCRIPTED THIS\nIt\u2019s been said that the Stock market will do the most damage, to the most people, at the worst time. And the current mortgage market is experiencing the most perfect storm. Just when volume levels were at the highest in history, servicing runoff at its peak, and pipelines hedged more than ever, the Coronavirus arrived.\nLenders need to clear their pipelines, but social distancing is making it more difficult for transactions to be processed. And those loans that are about to close require that employment be verified. As you can imagine, with millions of individuals losing their jobs, those mortgages are unable to fund, leaving lenders with more hedging losses and no income to offset it.\n\nWHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW\nFortunately, there are many smart people in the Mortgage Industry who are doing everything they can to navigate through these perilous times. But the Fed and our Government needs to stop making it more difficult. The Fed must temporarily slow MBS purchases to allow pipelines to clear. Lawmakers need to allow for first payment defaults, due to forbearance, to be saleable. And finally, the Fed must more clearly communicate that Mortgage Rates and the Fed Funds Rate are not the same. We have faith that the effects of the Coronavirus will subside and that things will become more normalized in the upcoming months.\n\n\nSo, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on - I\u2019d love some input on the best way to use this info for trades. Personally I think that mid-sized loan servicers with minimal diversity are most at risk. Quicken isn't publicly traded, Wells Fargo is too big for their mortgage servicing alone to cripple them. \n\nSo, what servicers are at risk? Cut and paste: The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) today released its mid-year rankings of commercial and multifamily mortgage servicers' volumes as of June 30, 2019. At the top of the list of firms is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., with $681.8 billion in master and primary servicing, followed by PNC Real Estate/Midland Loan Services  ($655.2 billion), KeyBank National Association ($273.1 billion), Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC  ($268.4 billion), and CBRE Loan Services ($208.3 billion).\n\nI like CBRE personally - they are exposed to residential MBS and to commercial MBS, retail property management, and just all around their revenue is from parts of the r.e. market that are likely to get fucked pretty hard.\n\nSo, I haven't taken this position yet but will this week - 9/18/2020 CBRE 35p. \n\nTL;DR: If you want to know details of how residential mortgage loan servicers are at high risk due to CARES Act, theres about 20 mins of reading. Or, just know they are at high risk unless the government fixes some shit they broke.",

        "selftext": "Every financial crisis is exactly the same. Investors figure out a fun new way to make money, lever up their investments, convince dumber investors and businesses to buy in, lever up some more, spread the risk around the entire financial system, and ride the wave up until it crests and crashes.\n\n* In the Panic of 1819, \"wildcat\" banks out west converted funding from the US bank (central bank at the time) into their own leveraged currency and handed out unsecured loans to land developers. Much of the land turned out to be worthless, and the banks went under, dragging down the US bank and US economy with them.\n* The Panic of 1837 was similar, except that east-coast banks handed out money to any and every cotton farmer in exchange for a profit split. When the cotton market crashed, so did the banks.\n* The next capital-P Panic, this one in 1857, was set off when the thousands of miles of tracks promised by mid-19th century-railroad startups stalled out in the construction phase. The implosion among investors reverberated through the entire economy.\n* Then there was the Really Big One -- the Crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression. Investors in the 1920s were absolutely out of their minds. They dished out easy money like candy in every direction and in every industry -- materials, construction, retail, automobiles, railroads -- believing that the good times of profitable plays and high returns would never end. This is when the semiotics of the stock market began to shift: investors started putting their faith in the rise of the DOW like it was a Newtonian law, without regard to what it stood for or the investments underneath. When those investments turned sour, the bubble grew larger before it finally popped.\n* Skipping ahead to 1987's Black Monday, we have investors so high on their own supply that they truly believe financial wizardry will save them from any downturn. In this early era of computers, traders started using smooth-brained algorithms to hedge their portfolios. Since the robots were protecting us, it was totally fine to lever up and throw money at anything that promised above-market returns. Because the algorithms will surely warn us before we head off the cliff, right? Nah. Stocks dove and brokerages faced margin calls that wiped away their balance sheets. Oops.\n* Reagan-Bush economic philosophy is perfectly captured by the Savings &amp; Loan Crisis. S&amp;Ls were like banks, only without any oversight whatsoever and lots of accounting gimmicks to make them look *not* insolvent. The clarion call for credit lines by unimaginably shitty businesses was heroically answered by S&amp;Ls across the nation. They doled out loans to just about anyone who asked for them at high interest rates and then cooked their books to make it look like they had plenty of working capital and a steady stream of investment income. Some of that income actually came from completely unrelated investments bought on margin, purportedly to hedge against credit risks. Like a mobius strip, the margin for those investments was backed by the loan obligations from the shitty companies they invested in. Just utter shit all the way down. The whole thing blew up in the early 1990s.\n* We didn't learn our lesson because we never do, which brings us to the Dot Com Bubble. Technology got shinier in the 1990s, and the investor class became ever-more transfixed by it. Imagine. The year is 1999. Dial-up speeds can load a gif in about one minute. You think you can start an e-commerce grocery delivery business on this platform, and investors are like, oh yeah man, fuck yeah, take my money! And even though you've reported less than $400K in total revenue, Goldman Sachs underwrites your IPO for a $5 billion valuation. (Goldman is shorting the shit out of you on the other side of their \"Chinese wall.\") The fiasco was fueled Y2K-induced magical thinking by boomer investors placing highly leveraged bets on every empty LLC with \"dot-com\" in its name, and delusional boomer management in tech, media, and telecom (and everywhere else) going deep into debt to finance insane business plans reliant on internet connections that still make phone beeping noise.\n* Next is a story we know: the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis. Let's extend insane amounts of credit to anyone with a pulse, bundle up the worthless contracts, stamp AAA on top, sell it to shit-tier mutual funds, borrow against it to take out massive amounts of insurance on it, take out even more insurance on it to bet against it because hey why the fuck not, and then let the perpetual free money machine do its thing. Use the perpetual free money machine to lever up investments everywhere else. Use those levered investments to make more levered investments. Call yourself CFO of Lehman Brothers.\n\nI have no doubt that the illustrious investor class has continued to fuck around over the last decade to build up yet another unsustainable house-of-cards shit-bubble. And now that stocks are tanking, economic activity is screeching to a halt, bond yields are plummeting, and fed rates are reaching zero, it's only a matter of time before the first dominoes start to fall.\n\nBut a market bubble implosion is also an opportunity for tremendous gains. Think John Paulson shorting the ever-loving fuck out of the housing market before the subprime mortgage crisis and reaping $4 billion. The only problem is that real bubbles are very hard to spot, even if they are obvious in retrospect. Finance has become so convoluted that everything can look like a bubble if you stare at it for long enough.\n\nSo here are some ideas for where the bubble may be lurking. I'll add any other credible hypotheses to this list if the post gains interest.\n\n**1.** **Corporate loans**\n\nLow interest rates during the last 10 years have prompted businesses to borrow money with abandon. On the other side of the equation, investors seeking above-market returns have been dishing out these loans like candy. Rising tides across the economy have convinced businesses and investors alike that the risk of these loans going south are immaterial. Reminiscent of the S&amp;L crisis, many of these loans have been given to businesses with little collateral, low liquidity, and tenuous cash flow. If these businesses cease to operate, they will quickly become insolvent, investors will realize huge losses on their loan portfolios, and insurance payouts will balloon.\n\nPer the Fed, corporate debt &amp; loan liabilities have skyrocketed in recent years:  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TCMILBSNNCB](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TCMILBSNNCB) \n\nSame with bonds, which will face the same problem as loans:  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CBLBSNNCB](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CBLBSNNCB) \n\n\"Other loans and advances\" and \"miscellaneous liabilities\" (very mysterious) have boomed:\n\n [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/OLALBSNNCB](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/OLALBSNNCB) \n\n [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MLLBSNNCB](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MLLBSNNCB) \n\nI think this is the most likely origin of a potential market collapse. Market, bond, and loan values are dependent on the uninterrupted function of cash-poor businesses. If any of these are serving as collateral for other investments, or as the foundation for securitized products, then the crash could be spectacular.\n\n**2. Shadow banking**\n\nFollowing the financial crisis, Congress put a muzzle on the world's biggest banks through tougher capital and liquidity requirements. They were forced to delever their balance sheets, unwind from risky investments, and toughen their lending requirements. This didn't stop the demand for risk, though, which moved into the \"shadow banking\" sector. Investment firms like Blackstone, Blackrock, KKR, and Bridgewater and smaller investment banks like Moelis, Houlihan, and Jeffries picked up where JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs left off. We can assume they have loaded up on leverage to purchase what were considered low-risk assets amid low interest rates and broadly appreciating markets. The extent to which they can de-lever without blowing up their balance sheets will determine whether they sink or swim. If they sink, the repercussions will be broad and start to impact the TBTF banks that were supposed to be reined in by financial crisis-era regulations. We can also assume, to some degree at least, that firms like Goldman and Morgan Stanley, which do not have large consumer lending &amp; banking businesses, were able to creatively skirt regulatory requirements and load up on riskier assets. Goldman's latest 10K shows that the firm has up to 70% of its credit portfolio in non-investment grade or distressed corporate loans (see #1 above). That's going to be a problem.\n\n**3. Leveraged real estate**\n\nA major part of the 2008 financial crisis was the implosion of the subprime mortgage market. A decade later, there has been a major shift away from home ownership and toward rental properties. But subprime mortgages have also started to creep back up, with longer terms and higher interest rates. Rental income &amp; long-term mortgage payments are presumably safer for investors than the types of agreements we saw leading up to 2008, but that logic implodes when they're propped up by leverage, securitized into new investment products, and under-girded by rental and mortgage contract terms that consumers are unable to meet. We know that there is a lot of leverage in this sector -- investment firms attest to as much -- and depending on the extent of that leverage, the end result could be a disaster.\n\nThose are my initial musings. Still thinking through potential positions. I think Blackstone &amp; Morgan Stanley could be left holding the bag if the system implodes. Urban-focused REITs could be in major trouble. And businesses with high levels of short-term liabilities in the form of leveraged loans and bonds could start to fold.",

        "selftext": " Before, you start reading on the main topic, i would like to make an analogy.\n\nThe reason World War I started is extensively credited to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. \n\nIt's assassination is considered the fuse tha would light the fire that would culminate in World War I.\n\nEurope had many problems between it's nations before the assassination, things weren't going well diplomatically and there was a huge pressure on aliances systems and so on, it was just waiting to happen and the murder of the archduke just made it possible.\n\nHaving that in mind:\n\nThe coronavirus was just the fuse that would light the fire to the recession.\n\nRelevant things that were happening before the coronavirus:\n\n1. Corporate profits were already in a recession.\n2. Huge piles of corporate debt, we are at the end of a credit cycle, meaning people and corporation will have to spend less to cut back on debt.\n3. The P/E ratio of the S&amp;P 500, for example, had valuations comparable to previous markets just before the crash, like 2000 and 2008.\n4. The Fed already wasted almost all of it\u2019s ammo, reducing it\u2019s ability to keep the economy going, the stock market has been relying for years on the Fed to keep the party going, now that they realize they are on their own, investors could finally realize every price is pretty much inflated.\n5. Even though interest rates are historically low, the inflation rate is low, even with a low unemployment rate. This definitely means there is some core problems with the economy since it is a clear show of how much pressure the Fed, consumers and the producers are putting to stimulate growth but it\u2019s still lackluster and clearly show signs of contraction.\n6. Millennials and Generation Z are becoming more important every year for the economy. They are probably the most indebted populations there are, reducing their ability to consume, work and to defend themselves against a recession.\n7. Even though we have unemployment at record lows, Americans suffer from low wages, almost no working rights, and low capabilities to consume since household debt is at record lows (can\u2019t stimulate growth in the economy if all the households are using their paychecks is just to stay afloat and live up to the next paycheck, leaving little room to actually consume).\n\nSo, you have that in mind, and also a Bull Market that has been going since 2009, for 10 years, when the average is 8.\n\nSo, if it wasn\u2019t coronavirus it would be something\u2019s else, but let\u2019s examine it\u2019s economic impact.\n\n1. The virus will cause a huge supply shock because of low volume of commerce since China is basically on quarantine and the world depends on China to many of it\u2019s goods.\n2. On the side of the consumers, you can cut rates as much as want, but a huge household debt won\u2019t disappear out of nowhere it these lackluster wages workers are given, have that in mind, the virus is another incentive to consume even less.\n3. These halts on supply on demand can cause huge problems on corporations that today are up to their eyeballs in debt, failing to pay short term debts, causing a huge death spiral.\n4. The outbreak is not even a it\u2019s peak and already caused a huge economic impact that will only get worse.\n5. You can't compare virus outbreaks to previous outbreaks. Because the variable (the virus itself) is completely different from previus outbreaks. People keep comparing this COVID-19 with the SARS in 2003 and they compare how the market reacts back then and think things are going fine. In 2003 the world was much less dependent on China commerce, the Stock Market was just beginning it's Bull Market that would end in 2008. Today we are on all time highs and very much depend on China for global commerce, this virus is much more capable of infection than SARS were, meaning it's economic impact is far greater than any outbreak there. \n\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t see the next month with good eyes.\n\nAlso, one last thing to make things clear:\n\nYou don\u2019t do a emergency cut of 50 bps on a national interest rates if you think the economy is strong and have good foundations, you do it because shit is going down fast and the gears of the economy are starting to break down even faster and you are trying to keep it going by cutting the rates.",

Now we're both coughing a shit ton, and I woke up shivering uncontrollably last night drenched in sweat with a high fever.

I called 811 and they said since I'm not actively dying or work in healthcare, I don't qualify for a test.\n\nWatch this NYC ER doc talk about how fucked everything is: https://youtu.be/J7s6n_ySkmQ\n\nThose who think we're at the bottom are dreaming.

        "selftext": "If you're not in bear gang, it's not too late to join, and I suggest you do so promptly because shits about to hit the fan frens. That being said, I plan on riding the \"V\" down and up on this one, and lastly, if you're a perma bull you're in luck I've got some companies at the bottom that I think will go up over the next few months.\n\n**What's about to happen:**\n\nLet's stick to the facts and correlate this puppy to a similar outbreak; H1N1: \"*From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus... Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated* \" [\\[1\\]](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html)\n\nSince H1N1 got memory holed and everybody forgot about it, the virus became a modern flu, we have flu shots for this thing and chances are you've probably had it at one point or another -- it's just one of the flues that floats around each season. But the Corona is different...\n\nFirst off, this thing already has a reproduction rate higher than any of the previous outbreaks in the last 150 years [\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notable_flu_pandemics). AND it's one of the most deadly -- however only to certain age groups which is a big difference [\\[4\\]](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/). Now I do want to make it clear that the Spanish Flu was a lot deadlier to healthy adults, also the age demographics have changed. StatsCanada actually has a good tool that shows the population pyramid and you can compare Spanish Flu in 1918 to 2020 and it'll have some similar-ish results to the USA [\\[5\\]](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/pyramid/pyramid.cfm?type=1&amp;geo1=01). There's also population pyramid tool here for the USA but it only goes back to 1950 [\\[6\\]](https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2020/). \n\nBuddy of mine with access to a Bloomberg terminal sent this to me the other day which tracks the spread of the Corona virus [\\[7\\]](https://imgur.com/a/O4J6cuc). Think the code is 'Map Virus' or something. What matters is that we can see a very obvious trend of exponential growth, in fact that's how you model these things... This thing will spread like wildfire once it starts to hit the cities in America, and... already has. [All it takes is one 'chad spreader'](https://imgur.com/a/N542fqR) to jump on the subway and it'll be a matter of weeks and the entire city is infected. In fact it's already happened in Toronto so buy puts on $CANADA [\\[8\\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-toronto-man-diagnosed-with-covid-19-used-local-transit-for-three-days/).\n\nWhat matters is that we can see that something like \\~60.8 million people who got H1N1 in the USA from 2009 to 2010 and this thing had an r0 of only like \\~1.5ish. The bat soup virus currently has an estimated r0 at \\~2.4 right now, mind you this is a number that varies through time and can decrease by human intervention (such as quarantines of cities), which will inevitably transpire... \n\nIf we assume that this thing spreads with even some level of similarity to H1N1 in 2009, this is going to be a bloodbath for the boomers. First and foremost, this will spread at a much higher rate among boomers and those in old folks homes, we've got evidence of that already [\\[9\\]](https://www.fox19.com/2020/03/07/coronavirus-concerns-stalls-cruise-ship-off-california/).\n\nBut that's not all. Italy is fucked. They just announced a quarantine of 1/4 of their fucking population [\\[10\\]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-live-updates-third-death-in-australia-as-cases-reach-more-than-70). Take wild guess how that's going to fare for their economy. The FTSE MIB is down shy of 20% from it's highs as it stands right now and its only going to get worse [\\[11\\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/i945?countrycode=it). Given that the Italy  is basically a leading indicator of what's going to happen in the USA...  I fucking DARE YOU to buy spy calls.\n\nSo let's get to the nuts and bolts of this. Some autist named Dr. James Lawler stated that worst case scenario this thing could infect 96m in the USA and kill 480,000 people [\\[12\\]](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-dr-james-lawler-warning-us-hospitals-infection-a9385031.html). However, funny enough his estimates are based on a mortality rate of 0.5%. The current mortality rate is \\~3.5% so, rather, we could be looking at up to 3,360,000 dying in the USA if the mortality rate is what it currently is.\n\nHowever, we can math this based on the population pyramids I posted above. In the USA if we take the known mortality rates and population pyramid and transpose that on the worst case scenario, we're looking at shy 1.9m dead (mostly older people) given that 30% get the virus in the next year [\\[13\\]](https://imgur.com/a/vfOz0Nf). If this spreads at the same rate as H1N1, then we're looking at a total of \\~60.8 million infected in a year's time. This corresponds to \\~18.6% of the population getting it and would result in \\~1.16m people dead [\\[14\\]](https://imgur.com/a/WUDaMza). \n\nNow, I'm willing to bet that my boy Donnie isn't interested in losing a massive chunk of his voting block so I'm betting that we see quarantines very soon in the USA, entire cities shut down just like we've seen in China and just like we've seen in Italy and Iran. It's going to happen and when it does, the lemmings will be shocked. I mean, this shouldn't come as a surprise, there's already runs on toilet paper in Australia over this thing [\\[15\\]](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/australians-scrap-toilet-rolls-coronavirus-panic-buying-200308014116516.html). \n\nAnyways, I think we'll get a cure eventually and that everybody reading this will be fine, in fact I'm not a doomer whatsoever. Society will continue on and SPY will eventually recover and I'll join bull gang again, but I'm sure Monday will be a bloodbath after Italy quarantined like 16 million people.\n\nBut back to my point, just think about what'll happen to SPY when a US city announces a quarantine. They're already preparing for it by declaring states of emergency now [\\[16\\]](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-202-declaring-disaster-emergency-state-new-york). The fear will be real and it already is...\n\nSo how do we profiteer from this? And what will inevitably transpire?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI know half of you retards skipped to here but kudos to the champions that read everything I wrote. \n\n1) General stock market decline, puts on $SPY or high beta stocks if IV isn't too high\n\n2) for my perma-bull frens, calls on funeral home and burial companies: $SCI, $CSV, $MATW, $PLC:CA, $DTY:UK, etc.\n\n3) Puts on old folks care homes because those are probably going to be vacant here very shortly and thus less cash flows to investors... stocks like: $WELL, $VTR $OHI, etc.\n\n4) I'm still bearish airlines and travel... I mean go look at the chart of $AAL. After 9/11 that stock went from $40 a share to literally $2 a share... in 2003. The same thing happened during the GFC, stock again went from over $40 a share to a fucking penny stock -- traded at like $0.30 per share. Get ready for round 3... I look forward to buying calls on airlines after this is all over.\n\n5) bearish any developing country/emerging market ETF's. They're going to get hit hard.\n\n6) I don't know anything about medical or medical research stocks but calls and puts on companies researching corona virus cure. Again... correct me if I'm wrong but to my understanding it's zero-sum, the company that gets a solid cure makes bank and the rest are fucked but again idk this isn't my area whatsoever. Also looks like a lot of these stocks are rocketing and IV is massive so I'm sitting on the sidelines on this one\n\nIf you're from r/all wanting to get in on the tendies, I saved a special one just for you!

Right?\n\nDuring the financial crisis of 2008, it became clear that the government had to step in. People were losing their jobs, stock market dropped by more than 30%, the market was going up and down by 5-10% a day (the amount my brokerage accounts would go up or down was more than what I was earning in a month at work). It was humbling.\n\nIt was really tough and difficult to trade. Buy on the down days? Sell on the up days? Hold it until sky clears, despite having bled a lot of money already? I was over leveraged too (through LEAP options), which was not the smartest thing to do at the time, but heh, are you going to lock the loss?\n\nThen came the bailout, with a lot of volatility leading to it.

(They may have failed to pass the first version even, I don't remember).\n\nFinally, one of the branch passes it, and it's time for the other branch to pass it. \"About time, after the bailout, things are going to get better, we can save those companies, we can move ahead and blue sky is coming.\"\n\nI remember at the time, I was looking at the final votes, and I could not believe it. As the votes would come in, and it became clear that the bailout would pass, S&amp;P futures started to drop, like a stone. WTF!!! Help is coming, everything will get better, why is it dropping?\n\nWell, the reason is simple, by signing the bailout, politicians agreed that we were in a shitty situation, companies needed to be saved, and the lousy bailout was getting signed, and there was no more good news down the line for a while. We shot our ammos, and now let's pray. So it became sell the news.\n\nAs the market continued dropping days after days, and I was going to be wiped out, I had to sell to not be over leveraged anymore. I had to take a 6 figures loss. And I am fortunate that I sold, because the market continued to significantly tank for almost 6 more months to level I did not think we would reach. After selling, I was not taking as much risk anymore, I got burned hard.\n\nAfter we reached the bottom, I switched my positions to risky assets, and I was able to make up some of the losses. But that was a great learning experience, and I figured that I preferred to learn that lesson at the time, when my accounts were not too big than later. Recovering from a 6 figures loss is doable, but more than that, and it is a decade or more of setback.\n\nWell, I can say that almost 12 years later (fuck, already!), the situation is very similar.\nThis time, I was ready, and maybe that will be another post to explain what I did in 2019-2020, as it can be easily applied.\n\nSo today:\n- People were losing their jobs. Check.\n- Stock market dropped by more than 30%. Check.\n- The market was going up and down by 5-10% a day. Check.\n- Bailout in the process, taking days to agree on. Check.\n\nI am not saying that the market is going to drop after the bailout is voted, but watch out for that.\nUnlike 2008, there is no blue sky coming. The bailout is only a short term fix. How long do you think $1200 per person is going to last?\n\nUnlike 2008, we know that the worst is ahead of us. We still don't know. In the US, the coronavirus pandemic is expected to peak in at least 2-3 weeks. But who knows?\nAs we are doubling every 2-3 days, it could mean 100 times more new cases per day. 100 times more death per day (few weeks later the infection). It's absolutely a staggering and awful number.\nHopefully, lockdown will be enforced in every state, so we can reduce this grow rate.\nHospitals are already over capacity, nobody can tell exactly how this is going to end (except that's going to be a carnage).\nEsp. as some are talking about removing the lockdown in 2 weeks!\nAnd even after the peak, it means that people are still getting sick, people are still dying, as they are hospitalized for 2-4 weeks.\nExpect at least 1-2 months of pain, even after peak.\n\nI understand that the market is forward looking, but there are still many opportunities for false head starts, and failed bounces from the bottom.\n\nFrom my experience with the 2008 bailout, nobody could really predict the bottom. Even as it was a financial crisis.\nThis time, it is not looking pretty, so please don't be like the 2008-me, don't be over-leveraged (yet), things can go either way. Politicians are very good at messing up a crisis.\n\nAnd most of all, be safe and healthy, stay home as much as you can. It is going to be a rough ride, and unfortunately we are only getting started.\nMy sincere thoughts for people with friends and families that are going through hardship, sickness and death.\nHang in there!",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: I\u2019m a degenerate who likes looking at graphs and has a gambling addiction (but made 50% return today)\n\nHi yet again my fellow autists, as you can tell, my guess turned out to be correct and the market opened red today. This reinforces the trend and I will buy either calls or puts on SPY based on it before the closure today again.\n\nWhat happened yesterday: People were anticipating good news from Trump. Just like always he made himself an idiot (not surprising). Hence stonks went down.\n\nThis graph shows a reoccurring trend that basically happens every day for quite some time now. We can see that if the market closes with a 15 min green candle, it will open a lot lower the next day and vice versa. \n\nThis happens because we are in a very volatile market and people are scared to keep their stocks overnight. This means if the market is trending up at the end of the day people will be selling and if market is going down most see it as an opportunity. This results in the market going in the opposite direction on the next day opening. \n\nAdditionally, if we end up breaking the 173 resistance today and close with a green candle (15 min), the chance of it being bloody tomorrow is very fucking high.\n\n[https:\\/\\/imgur.com\\/a\\/fmwjS9x](https://preview.redd.it/a2m0c9wy33m41.png?width=2620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c4509a6fbf6a52d7c953453fafb8013be5e6ed2)\n\nId like to address a couple of comments from yesterday:\n\nFor the retard who mentioned recency bias. The whole theory of trading is based on the idea that   \na trend is more likely to continue than stop.

        "selftext": "If you've paid any attention to the financial news over the last 2 years, you've seen the questions and critiques about Warren Buffett's cash position. In almost every interview he's asked why is he stacking cash or why Berkshire isn't outperforming the S&amp;P 500. The majority of questions aren't as brazen, but rewatch some of his interviews and you'll see that 1 or 2 questions along those lines comes up. \n\nTake this article by CNBC:\n\n*Being in the enviable position of having that much cash to spend seems unenviable at the moment, as far as Berkshire shareholders, and maybe even Buffett, are concerned. Buffett\u2019s company is currently on pace for its worst annual stock performance since 2009.*\n\n*\u201cHe pinned himself into a corner a few years ago, saying I can\u2019t have $150 billion in cash in three to four years and say that\u2019s alright,\u201d said Greggory Warren, a Morningstar analyst who covers Berkshire Hathaway.*\n\n*Underperformance versus the index, deals that have not worked out well, such as Kraft Heinz (thought it showed signs of life in its most recent earnings), and increasing willingness on Buffett\u2019s part to consider share buybacks, all point to the the importance of moving that cash into investments that generate a return.\"*\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/even-obvious-way-for-buffett-to-solve-big-cash-problem-is-a-puzzle.html\n\nI can spend all day finding each and every article from the past 2-3 years but you understand my point. \n\nAs stocks soared to all time highs, people wondered just as they did during the tech boom whether Buffett had lost his touch. Now Buffett is sitting on a 125+ Billion dollar mountain of cash just biding his time. He's poised more favorably than he could ever ask for, and prices are just getting more reasonable by the day.\n\nTLDR: When you see Buffett stacking cash, he's not an idiot. He's waiting for prices to become reasonable again, which only happens after a significant market decline. \n\nI'm not saying he's an oracle, but he's rarely wrong.",

        "selftext": "Hey. Let me tell you about how WSB is getting screwed even when it\u2019s right. It\u2019s a novel so go make some tea.\n\nThe past week has been crazy. 3m unemployed and stocks only went up. Makes no sense, right? Wrong. What you guys need to realize is that the market is not an omnipotent being that prices in every move and plays 4d chess. It\u2019s more like a caveman, driven by greed and fear. Especially during this time.\n\nThree weeks ago, everything was fucked. Not because the virus was spreading, which it always was, but because people started to realize how bad it was and began panic selling. And the trigger was the oil crisis over the weekend that led to bloody Monday. Leveraged funds exploded. Investors were getting margin called or panic sold. Treasuries were basically unobtainable. Corporate bond issuances completely froze. Credit default swaps skyrocketed. Commercial REITS were fucked because they needed to sell illiquid assets to meet fund outflows. Every company was maxing out its credit lines with the banks\u2026you get the idea.\n\nIt was like a run on the banks, but for corporations and investors. That\u2019s what drove the markets down. Plain and simple. It was FEAR of a LIQUIDITY CRISIS.\n\nThen Powell stepped in with his alphabet soup of liquidity mechanisms. ZIRP, PDCF, MMLF, CPFF, FX Swap, TALF, PTIF, ESF, SMCCF, PMCCF. I made up one in there and it doesn\u2019t even matter.\n\nWhat mattered was that, suddenly, the liquidity crisis vanished. The fund backstopped everything with its QE infinity. Yield spreads fell back. People didn\u2019t need to margin sell anymore. Foreign dollar denominated debt wasn\u2019t about to fuck up an emerging world country economy. THAT\u2019s what rallied the market. Immediate FEAR was taken out. And that\u2019s why all the \u201cbut worldometer virus count doubles every three days so markets go down\u201d geniuses got screwed.\n\nFor better or worse, with the Fed promising QE forever, the liquidity crisis is now no longer a thing. What comes next will be more ominous: a solvency crisis.\n\nLiquidity is basically any company\u2019s ability to pay very short-term liabilities, like payroll, interest, rent, etc. in the VERY IMMEDIATE TERM. It's about access to cash. For financial markets, it\u2019s also how easily investors can get in and out of positions. Powell lubed the shit out of liquidity.\n\nSolvency, on the other hand, is about the company\u2019s ability to meet LONG TERM debt obligations with its operations. When you talk about unemployment, no consumer spending, high corporate debt load,etc, what you\u2019re really talking about is a solvency issue. Companies can\u2019t produce the revenue to service their debts.\n\nCorporate debt levels are astronomical today. Higher than any level in history. At same time, the virus is not slowing. Consumers and companies are not going to spend. Unemployment is through the roof. The fundamentals are really, really bad.\n\nBUT here\u2019s the kicker, now we\u2019re talking about fundamentals, and NOT fear. The market will trade down because the fundamentals are bad, not because its panicking for lack of liquidity, and that will take time.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is yes, the outlook is atrocious and the market deserve to be much lower. BUT it will take much longer to play out because people are no longer panic selling. The Great Depression took 3 years to get from its high to bottom after Bloody Thursday/Tuesday.\n\nYes, maybe the SPY will hit 180 or even lower. BUT it may take 6 months to get there. Meanwhile your OTM 4/17 puts will bleed on theta and never get ITM.\n\nWe\u2019re still at a time of VIX backwardation, meaning expected volatility in the more distant future is LESS than in the near future. I think this is bullshit and an opportunity. With a solvency crisis, it\u2019s a slow burn all the way down.\n\nOr I\u2019m just full of shit.\n\nTL;DR: look for long-dated puts. July, September, or even later. Buckle up and pay the premium. Be careful with very short term, very OTM options. Volatility will likely go down even as stocks go down.",

        "selftext": "Companies have endured financial meltdowns, civil wars and natural disasters. But nothing in modern memory has dented both demand and supply so quickly for so many industries as the coronavirus.\n\nThe virus, which has infected more than 85,000 people, has quickly spread through Asia and Europe, disrupted global travel and hobbled supply chains that churn out everything from smartphones to pharmaceuticals. In days, it went from pockets of woe to the top concern of chief executives world-wide.\n\nConferences are getting canceled, from the Geneva International Motor Show to Facebook Inc.\u2019s F8 developer gathering in California. Disneyland Tokyo is closed. Auto suppliers are warning of parts shortages. Generic drug manufacturers are paying 50% more for some raw materials.\n\nThe widespread nature of the epidemic and related uncertainty will put a hold on large corporate investments, mergers and hiring, said Stanford University economist Nicholas Bloom, who has researched the impact of uncertainty on business cycles.\n\n\u201cA lot of the damage is already being inflicted purely from major decisions being delayed,\u201d Mr. Bloom said. \u201cI can\u2019t see many firms green-lighting any projects until they can figure out what is going on.\u201d\n\nLarry Kudlow, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said Friday the threat from the virus for Americans is low and the \u201ccoronavirus is not going to sink the U.S. economy.\u201d Some in the White House have blamed the media\u2019s coverage of the outbreak for exaggerating the situation and causing hysteria.\n\nThe virus surfaced as U.S. companies were riding atop America\u2019s longest economic expansion on record, matched by soaring stock-market returns. But profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies started to cool last year, squeezed by rising labor costs and trade disruptions.\n\nOfficial Chinese government gauges of activity in the manufacturing and services sectors plunged to record lows in February, the country said Saturday, dropping deep into territory that indicates a contraction.\n\nIn the U.S., business activity in February fell to its lowest level in more than six years on fears of the epidemic.\n\nIn February, 129 companies in the S&amp;P 500 discussed \u201ccoronavirus\u201d in their quarterly earnings calls, up from 60 in January, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of transcripts. There were nearly 600 mentions of the virus in companies\u2019 security filings in the past week alone, according to Kaleidoscope, a research firm.\n\nExecutives have talked about how the virus will slow consumer spending on products from Crocs sandals to Gucci handbags. It has slowed production at nickel mines in Indonesia and halted the filming of \u201cMission Impossible 7\u201d in Venice.\n\nAt the same time, many companies have cautioned it is too soon to tell how serious an economic problem the virus will be.\n\n\u201cEvery CEO that I know has got to manage an employee dimension, supply-chain dimension, in many cases a revenue dimension,\u201d as well as Wall Street\u2019s needs, said Mike White, who ran PepsiCo Inc.\u2019s PEP -3.18% international division in 2003 when SARS hit. He now sits on the boards of Whirlpool Corp., WHR -2.73% Kimberly-Clark Corp. KMB -2.10% and Bank of America Corp. BAC -2.16% \u201cWe\u2019re still in the middle of the river here,\u201d he said.\n\nWhirlpool cited its sales and supply chain in China and elsewhere in Asia in trimming its first-quarter profit guidance Friday. The appliance maker said the outbreak in northern Italy, where it has manufacturing operations, would hurt sales there too.\n\nSome companies that have tried to gauge the impact of the virus have had to revise initial estimates. Emerson Electric Co., EMR -0.42% which makes factory automation equipment, warned on Feb. 13 the virus would reduce quarterly sales by $75 million to $100 million. On Friday, it put the damage as high as $150 million.\n\nOn Friday, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL -5.16% postponed until September an investor meeting that was scheduled for March 5, saying it couldn\u2019t have a productive conversation on its long-term strategy until the virus abates. United also is offering certain pilots the option of taking April off with reduced pay, according to a letter from the pilot union chairman to members.\n\nAirlines have taken one of the hardest, earliest hits from the spread of the virus. Asian and European carriers have implemented cost-cutting measures to accommodate canceled flights to China and curtailed services to other affected areas such as Italy.\n\nAs the spread of the virus in China has slowed, some Chinese factories are reopening, though many are short-staffed and transportation is still difficult. For example, smartphone makers are expected to ship 64 million fewer devices in the first half of 2020, market researcher International Data Corp. said, hampered by component shortages and quarantine mandates.\n\nZuru Ltd.\u2019s factories have reopened in phases over the past few weeks, after the toy maker installed dividers between workspaces and added sanitation stations. But the Shenzhen-based company is thinly staffed due to restrictions on China travel and was operating at 20% capacity last week, said co-founder Anna Mowbray. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be holes on shelves,\u201d she said.\n\nIn other countries, the disease is still spreading. Hyundai Motor Co. on Friday stopped building its popular Palisade SUV and other U.S.-sold SUVs after a factory worker in Korea tested positive for coronavirus. Google said Friday one of its employees in Zurich had been diagnosed, but the office remains open.\n\nSome companies are getting hit in multiple ways. Water-heater maker A.O. Smith Corp. AOS -1.42% detailed its situation in a securities filing: It has resumed operations in China but at below-normal levels. The stores where its products are sold are mostly closed or operating on reduced hours with significant decline in customer visits, the Milwaukee-based company said. Its products require professional installation, which is limited because of disease containment efforts in China, it said.\n\n\nChina is a key supplier of chemical and raw materials used by many pharmaceutical manufacturers, a potential problem for popular blood-pressure medicines and several older antibiotics that are no longer manufactured in the U.S.\n\nExperts believe China is also the only maker of key ingredients in a class of decades-old antibiotics known as cephalosporins, which treat a range of bacterial infections including pneumonia.\n\nAutomotive suppliers are warning car companies they could run out of certain parts used in North American factories in coming weeks, with particular concern over potential shortages of electronic components. Hoping to stave off factory stoppages, some manufacturers have taken the unusual and costly step of flying in critical parts by cargo planes.\n\nVehicle sales in China plummeted 92% in the first 16 days of February, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Several suppliers have cut profit forecasts in recent days because of the fallout, including electronics suppliers Aptiv PLC and Visteon Corp., and seat maker Adient PLC.\n\nSome companies have benefited from the outbreak, which has spurred buying of respiratory face masks and disinfecting wipes, propping up the shares of some of the companies that make them. Clorox Co. CLX -5.50% \u2019s stock briefly hit record highs last week while the broader market plunged.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that the shock from the virus is hitting at a time when households appear to be in good shape,\u201d wrote Bob Schwartz, a senior economist with Oxford Economics.\n\nMr. White, the former PepsiCo executive, said the long-term economic outlook is solid but there is short-term pressure on companies. \u201cAlmost every company is going to have an issue with their first quarter numbers,\u201d he said.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-is-different-almost-no-company-is-safe-11583064000?mod=hp_lead_pos3",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nThe markets are on track for a third straight green day with Dow currently at +4% at the time of this writing, and having that crazy rally 3 days ago with 13%\\~ increase.\n\n Historical unemployment rates that are worse than the great depression and no solution in sight for the virus (especially in the US with the president not taking action with a full lockdown) means that there are many more deaths to come. The tourism, entertainment and sports industries (among full others) are completely crushed. And we still didn't get to the supply chains issues (Iphone 12 has been postponed by a few months already, total smartphones shipments have decreased YoY in the most amount ever, etc).. What makes America a powerhouse - consumerism - is on hold. So why are the stocks going up? Is this truly phase 2 of a bull trap or magically the US decided that printing money and offering 2 trillion dollars will solve everything and they were right?\n\nMaybe I'm stupid, maybe I waited to much on the sidelines (I have 6 figures to invest and haven't touched it yet) but when you hear that even the Olympics got postponed which only happened previously in history at war times, it's almost 'obvious' that the market will at least crash more than 2008. \n\nSo, thoughts? Yeah, I know that this might be the daily what if thread but also I'm truly confused. Would love your thoughts on this wild market right now.",

        "selftext": "Guys, lets be real. I've read the opinions of every hey googler and Robinhood gambler and all they do is confuse things so let an industry professional of 15 years tell you some of the facts. About history and the potential future.\n\nIn 2008, the unraveling of the financial system was caused by absolutely over-leveraged risky assets that became too much, and were the \"straw that broke the camels back\" in a big way. It was caused by gross ignorance and greed on a level that we might never see again. Debt issued to people who were obviously never going to be able to pay it back, bundled together and sold to large institutions, they were considered invincible, and many regular people's retirement accounts were comprised of securities in which these were the underlying asset. When the pool of shit that was all of these subprime mortgages that were issued to people who could never even wink at paying them back began to see higher defaults, the value of these assets tanked, and investors' heart rates started to climb as they saw the market for the underlying dry up. This was just the warm-up, the shot from the starting gun to initiate the sprint to the bottom came when Bear Stearns went tits up.\n\nA quick and over-simplified recap of what happened to them goes like this:\n\n\\-They bought tons of highly leveraged CDOs full of garbage mortgages that were somehow rated AAA, which is an investment grade given to instruments that are safe enough for retirement accounts and bank capital reserve requirements.\n\n\\-Because they were so highly leveraged, they were able to purchase well beyond their capital abilities, this was risky, so they bought Credit Default Swaps, which is insurance that protects them against unexpected market behaviors, and also provides a steady amount of income in calm conditions. This is what investors like to call a \"hedge\" because its an investment to protect another investment to some degree.\n\n\\-In 2007, delinquencies started to rise as people began to struggle to pay their mortgages more and more, this worried investors as the value of these CDOs began to fall. The fund started taking losses and people who had lended money to help BS finance this strategy began to request cash t cover losses, essentially a margin call on the firm. While they had insurance it wasn't covering their losses so they started to sell the underlying mortgages in bigger and bigger amounts to raise cash. Other institutions smelled blood in the water and began to accelerate the decrease in value of the mortgages to force BSs hand. These CDOs eventually became worthless, bankrupting the fund and toppling the institution, who was acquired by JP Morgan Chase through a Fed Loan.\n\n\\-This caused complete panic on Wall Street because banks could not make fair assumptions on the values of portfolios and this made them decrease lending to each other out of fear. No one really knew where all of these shit sandwiches were and what they could do.\n\n\\-This spread to other banks as there was a credit crunch and no one could borrow, banks began to struggle to come up with liquidity which quickly led to a bailout and a fat recession.\n\nThis is different from what we are experiencing now. Those toxic assets were nestled in mom and pop retirement accounts and were ultimately acquired by the US govt in a massive bailout for cents on the dollar to keep these institutions from wiping accounts to zero and destroying all of peoples life savings.\n\nIn this situation, we were in a slight bubble yes, many of these companies were overvalued and over-leveraged, but, with business humming along it was working out. Now the beer virus comes along and halts everything. Airlines, grounded. Factories, closed. Restaurants, take out only. Offices, closed.\n\nCompanies have lost their ability to conduct business as usual, and for this reason aren't pulling in enough revenue to pay their expenses. So what do they do? The lower their expenses. The highest generally being payroll, so they start by offering as much paid leave as they can to be nice and try to make the best of the situation, but they can only do that for so long with the cash they have on hand, if they even have any.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting.\n\nLooking ahead, these companies and small businesses have no idea when this will end, they're developing contingency plans and planning as far into the future as they can. This is what they will have to come up with.\n\nNot knowing how long this will last, the SMART business decision for them is to lay off or fire as many of their workforce as they can while still operating the best they can in these conditions. This makes sense for them because they know every other company is doing the same thing, driving labor supply up and decreasing wages, meaning when they hire employees back at the end of this they will be able to pay them less. Saving them money now and in the future. As an average Joe wondering what the future will hold for his paycheck and the market we can deduce a few things.\n\n1) This isn't going to get better soon, no we haven't hit the bottom and don't ask me when because there is no knowing. Don't look to 2008 because it's just not the same scenario and it is likely to play out different this time. Don't take my word for it but I think we are going to see choppy swings up nd down for a few weeks but they will generally trend in the direction of market sentiment, AKA is this getting better or worse. For now you can expect it to trend down because Beer virus isn't even done with its dynamic warm up before this Pornhub Premium level of fucking.\n\n2) Market prices shouldn't even be a worry of yours, even though you are here for advice of which stocks to buy or which options to gamble on, it would be best to either buy for value or consolidate into cash because the stock market is not behaving right and its got to do with the Fed doing funky things that no consumer will ever find out about.\n\n3) Unemployment will shoot up, and it will take a LONG time to come back down. Corporate profits will suffer and GDP is about to pass the kidney  stone of the century. Our economy is under siege, while it is in its early stages and if this went away tomorrow life would go back to normal, that is not going to happen and the effects of this will only be worse as time goes on. Big Donald says he wants to get things going again but he's just jealous of China going back to normal despite them trying to hide the fact that there will most likely be another outbreak there. Best to play it safe and kill this thing for good before we return to business but if I have learned anything about our Oompa Loompa in Chief is that he tends to pick up the picture book full of good ideas and stand on it so he looks taller during his COVID-19 press shit-shows. The effects of his inadequacies haven't hit yet but they will and he will be remembered for them, take no shelter in anything he says no matter how tempting it is.\n\nI feel like I have gotten terribly off topic but I just wanted to spew out some shit that's been rotting in my head and making a stench, also I'm sick of people trying to look to 2008 on advice of how or where the bottom will come upon us. This is a different animal, look for other indicators, specifically what the Fed is doing, and remember, the grass grows greener where the cash is, follow it.\n\nStay strong, plan ahead. This is the way.",

        "selftext": "The time is now. While everyone else is panicking this is your chance to find good discounts. Just make sure to follow some simple rules:\n\n1) If you have no idea what to invest in, invest in big names like Coke (KO), Microsoft (MSFT), Bank of America (BAC), or ETF's such as SPY, QQQ etc. It is really important that you don't put all your eggs in 1 basket so spread out your investments among the big names you know or an ETF to cover you. **This is the \"set it and forget it\" route. Invest in these types of companies/ETF's and don't look at your account for a while.** \n\n2) If you are feeling a little more gutsy you can invest in some companies that have been hit hard by the world events. Think banks, oil, leisure companies (like carnival (CCL)), think Airlines (DAL, AAL, etc.) Exxon (XOM), Chevron (CVX), BP (BP), and others. **I don't advise you doing this unless you can stomach heavy negative swings. I can't stress this enough.**\n\n3) Remember you are going to see wild swings from day to day. Don't let positive days make you feel like you know everything, and conversely, don't let red days make you feel like you have lost it all and you never should have done this in the first place. It is really important to keep your emotions out of the market. which leads to my next point.\n\n4) Only invest money you can afford to invest (aka: you will be fine without that money for at least 12 months). If you can't afford it and you invest you are basically gambling and there is no way to be rational with money you cannot afford to be without. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now is a great time to invest because there are companies out there that are heavily discounted that normally aren't this cheap. Do your best to take advantage of this moment, and try to keep a cool head while the general public is not calm.",

        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html\n\nU.S. stock futures opened sharply lower on Sunday night as Wall Street waits on Washington to agree to an economic stimulus and rescue plan to combat the giant economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures fell more than 900 points, or 5%, to hit their \u201climit down\u201d level. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were also down around 5%. Downside limits to futures contracts are implemented to ensure orderly market behavior. \n\nFutures could be highly volatile as headlines come out of a coronavirus task force news conference Sunday evening and as traders await news on a stimulus bill agreement (or lack of one).\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that financing programs to stimulate the economy could be worth $4 trillion, noting these efforts will include coordination with the Federal Reserve to provide businesses with necessary liquidity.\n\n\u201cWhen this started, this was a bit unique to the airline industry since we had shut down most of airline travel,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cThis liquidity facility is a broad-based liquidity facility working with the Fed.\u201d\n\nNational Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow also said Saturday an economic stimulus package will total more than $2 trillion, noting it will be equal to roughly 10% of U.S. economic output. Last week, President Donald Trump signed a $100 billion bill that expanded paid leave in the U.S.\n\nHowever, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., signaled she is not on board with the Republican-version of the stimulus plan, saying: \u201cFrom my standpoint, we\u2019re apart.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved a procedural vote related to the stimulus package to 6 p.m. from 3 p.m.\n\nDavid Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said the difference between a fast or a prolonged recovery in the stock market will come down to three factors: How quickly the virus is contained, whether businesses will have \u201d access to enough capital and liquidity to last the 90 to 180 days,\u201d and whether fiscal stimulus can stabilize growth forecasts.\n\n\u201cIf short-term shutdowns lead to business defaults, closures, and permanent layoffs, the damage to corporate earnings growth could persist well after the virus is contained,\u201d Kostin said in a note. \n\nWall Street has been clamoring for fiscal economic relief as the number of coronavirus keep surging. The number of confirmed global cases surpassed 300,000 over the weekend as deaths now total over 13,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIn the U.S., more than 30,000 cases have now been confirmed. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday cases in the state soared to 15,168 over the weekend. That\u2019s more than in France or South Korea. \n\nThe outbreak has led the New York Stock Exchange to close its trading floor and temporarily move to all-electronic trading beginning Monday. NYSE expects trading to proceed as normal. \n\n\u201cThings will get worse before they get better and the markets will continue to reflect that reality,\u201d said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics, in a note. \u201cThis means that a bottoming process will take more time and probably inflict more damage to equities.\u201d\n\nStocks suffered their biggest one-week decline since the financial crisis in 2008, with the S&amp;P 500 dropping more than 13%. Those losses put the broad market average more than 32% below its record set on Feb. 19.\n\nLast week ended with all 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closing more than 20% below their respective 52-week highs. The S&amp;P 500 was also on pace for its worst monthly performance since 1940.\n\nExpectations for the U.S. economy have also quickly deteriorated. Economists at Goldman Sachs wrote Friday they expect a 24% contraction for the second quarter after a 6% drop in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cSuffice to say that the economy entered a unique, sudden-stop recession in March,\u201d wrote Prajakta Bhide, strategist at MRB Partners. \u201cIf there is no concrete evidence of meaningful progress toward controlling the epidemic in the next eight weeks, there will be no basis for people and businesses to feel safe to begin to normalize economic activity.\u201d\n\nInvestors have also been rattled by a sharp decline in crude prices. West Texas Intermediate futures fell 29.3% last week, their biggest weekly fall since January 1991. U.S. crude is also more than 66% below its most-recent 52-week high.",

        "selftext": "Here's some information I've gathered over the past few.\n\nSo the CDC just announced TODAY that they're loosening the criteria for patients to be eligible to get a COVID-19 test. Up until now, the only time that patients were even tested for the virus is if they're in a HOSPITAL with a FEVER.. that means you could be walking into the doctor with a cough, runny nose, and sore throat, and they wouldn't even bust out the test kits. Let that sink in. This explains why the death rate for corona cases in USA is way higher than the average for other developed countries (\\~7% vs \\~2%). the US was only testing severe cases, which supports the story a supposed patient posted in the /r/coronavirus sub a few days ago, claiming they were sent home untested despite showing symptoms.\n\nThe US saw the first community transmission case a WEEK ago - since then we've had potentially contagious people being sent home untested. The old testing criteria probably damaged containment efforts, and the new testing criteria is going to cause an enormous spike in reported cases, guaranteed. We all saw how markets reacted when Italy reported a sudden spike in cases on Feb 22.. \n\nStill not convinced this is a problem? This virus is more contagious, and more deadly than seasonal flu's. Here's how the COVID-19 outbreak compares to similar epidemics in recent history. SARS, 2003 and MERS, 2012, the biologically most closely related viruses were not nearly as contagious and had almost no cases in the USA. We saw no disruption in daily lives. Now consider the H1N1 swine flu epidemic of 2009. Over 43,000 confirmed cases and over 1,200 deaths in the USA. Much more contagious/widespread than SARS/MERS with a similar death rate. Yet none of the above viruses had any negative impact on the markets. Basically, the flu is also less contagious than COVID-19. The average person with flu infects 1.3 other people, while beer virus infects 2.2. This is because a lot of people already have a naturally built up immunity to a lot of strains of the flu, while no one is immune to corona. \n\nCombine this with the fact that there is no vaccine in sight for the next year, you're gonna see some shit. During a calm year, the flu has some 10 million cases in the USA. If corona reaches even this level, we'll see deaths in the six figures. Hence the (failing) scramble to contain. Some people are speculating that the virus will go away with warmer weather, but both SARS and MERS flourished in the summer months, so good luck. \n\nAnd unlike the first death over the weekend, or the rate cut, a sudden spike in cases is not priced in. People were expecting a red Monday just because someone died over the weekend? The US had more than 60 cases at that point. With a death rate of some 2.5%, a death was highly probably. After today's rally the S&amp;P 500 is less than 9% below its all-time-high. Plus, if technicals are any indication, this back and fourth volatility is all the more reason to suspect we haven't hit the bottom.\n\nTLDR; Hope you're using these green days to buy cheap puts. Give it a few weeks before panic sets in.\n\n SPY 280 P 04/17 + VIX 40 C 04/17 = Ctrl + P",

This is known as the corporate bond market. Cucks who own corporate bonds make money by being paid in interest on those bonds.\n\nBut what happens when you have a global pandemic where businesses are forced to shut down for an undermined amount of time? Revenue streams dry up and those companies are now at risk of being unable to pay out the interest payments to the bond holders. This results in a default. Once a company defaults creditors set out on horses with massive dildos to fuck the life out of these companies and force them into bankruptcy. Usually by selling off all their assets to pay back the bond holders and creditors.\n\nThere are corporate bond ETF's that you can buy puts on, and that's probably what I'll put most of my money into. The corporate bond ETFs below are the ones I was able to find with the most Volume and OI.\n\n* $HYG\n* $LQD\n* $JNK\n\nBelieve it or not, fucking $GME GameStop has issued corporate bonds GUH! and $ALGT allegiant travel has some floating around too.

And I\u2019m starting to feel really shitty. \n\nLet me explain. \n\nWe\u2019re all having a good time \u201cmaking tendies\u201d. It\u2019s ain\u2019t that fucking hard... short any flagship equity within a sector that\u2019s directly impacted by the beer virus. All of you ass clowns let emotions get in the way of a good short and hold, and the ones that don\u2019t crush the gainz. \n\nThat said, here\u2019s the sad, and uneasy reality, that\u2019s starting to set in... This virus isn\u2019t a game, and people are about to die. [A lot of people. ](https://twitter.com/sethbannon/status/1236125593290276864?s=21)\n\nIt\u2019s all fun and games, until you realize your parents and grandparents are older than 60, and face the real prospect of critical illness. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s something more innocuous, like [the NBA playing the rest of the season with no fans. ](https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1236122231656378373?s=21)\n\nEither way, this is starting to feel like the prologue to a dystopian nightmare. In the span of tying this, I received four separate emails from various companies about \u201chow they are dealing with COVID\u201d, and an alert from my own healthcare provider on how I can order doctors on demand to lower my risk of exposure. \n\nSo again.. making money right now isn\u2019t hard. Before you \u201cpositions or ban\u201d me, scroll up and click the link and stfu. Grow some balls, make a basket of put options that short indexes and equities from impacted sectors, then go long on inversely correlates equities (ie hospital care providers). The market will generally drift down, and flash crash in the coming days (assuming this isn\u2019t too late and it all goes down Monday, given the fire hose of shifty news). \n\nBut as your laughing all the way to the bank while watching the world burn, I encourage you to step back and take some stock in what\u2019s actually happening here... because it\u2019s real fucked up, and about to land on your doorstep. \n\nI wish you all you fellow WSB\u2019ers the best of luck and health through these tough times.",

        "selftext": "Let\u2019s see how the current environment looks like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are **some uncertainties** that govern investors\u2019 reactions over the past 50 days:\n\n* Nobody knows how long will the pandemic last. Obviously, the longer the worse and there is no indication of slowing down.\n* Nobody knows if people who get sick will have immunity over the next potential virus wave.\n* Nobody knows how the transition period back to normal economic activity will be achieved and how long it will take.\n* Nobody can estimate the real economic damage to the backbone of the economy \u2192 SMEs\n* Nobody can estimate the second derivative of the sell-off effects, i.e. what will happen with the fallen angels and lack of liquidity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A few facts about the virus:**\n\n* Death rate varies between 0.5% \u2013 7%, depending on population age, ICU coverage and extent of population testing.\n* Most of the patients do not present symptoms for many days, which makes the virus extremely effective in spreading.\n* No vaccine is expected before the next 12\u201316 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now, a few economic facts and hard data:**\n\n* Almost 50% of US corporate debt is BBB rated now and with most of the world\u2019s population being under lock-down, it is no rocket science that big part of them will fall below investment grade.\n* Almost 3.3M Americans filed for jobless claims last week. This is 5x the previous record of 1982.\n* The Fed\u2019s balance sheet just exceeded $5 trillion for the first time.\n* Markets are deep into bear market territories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Covid-19 effect:**\n\nNow, it is important to clarify that Coronavirus will not disappear overnight. It will be a long and gradual process lasting 3\u20136 months. I am afraid the worse is yet to come for markets across the world. The detrimental effects in the real economy are becoming more obvious day by day and translated into spikes in unemployment, mortgage payment delays, lack of liquidity and financing for SMEs, cuts in Capex and supplies, and lastly corporate and personal defaults. This is a self-feeding loop probably leading to what economists describe as secular stagnation.\n\nThe Central Banks were not ready to face such a crisis. Rates were extremely low already and their balance sheets were already loaded with a lot of public and corporate debt. Another stimulus plan may be the only solution now, but it is not sustainable in the long run.\n\nMy opinion is that markets will remain into bearish territory for many months after the \u201cend of Covid-19\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What can ordinary investors do to prepare?**\n\n1. **You cannot time the market**. You never could and definitely cannot start now. So, instead of guessing whether stock markets are going to rise or fall further after Covid-19, adopt a longer horizon. Get some exposure in the stock market but do it for the long run. There is no point to pick the best mutual fund, as most of them underperform the markets. Go for a cheap ETF. Robinhood or Vanguard will probably do for most jurisdictions.\n2. **Normal diversifiers** like corporate bonds are always necessary for an all-weather portfolio. However, keep in mind that in every liquidity crunch most of the risky assets move together and move downwards.\n3. **Safe havens**, like government bonds (US, Germany, UK) still have their place in your portfolio.\n4. **Look for market-neutral alternatives**. This can be alternative types of exposure, investment styles, methods, etc. Look for market-neutral assets and funds. At the toughest periods, the market-neutral investments will keep your portfolio beating. It is true that market-neutral exposure is not the easiest thing to achieve as an ordinary investor, but there are a few apps that try to achieve that. I find Daedalus Investment Platform interesting, but I am sure there will be others as well for jurisdictions not covered.\n5. **Keep some cash**. Not only as a safe haven but to also exploit opportunities when you identify them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary**: These are hard times for the markets and events that are unprecedented for our generation. It is and will be tough, but the best we can do is be prepared both for the virus (social distancing &amp; healthy routine) and for our long-run financial plan.",

However, since then the Fed has stepped in with unprecedented action and now there is a new stimulus package expected to pass this week.  Has anyone's outlook changed?

        "selftext": "**Cars: GM 01/15/21 $20p .... FCAU 01/15/21 $10P**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the economy seeming entering in to the next recession (or worse), we are all wondering where we can get our money in to become the guy from the Big Short.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs noted in the TL;DR at the top for all the autists who can only read TSE, I believe the auto industry will be the next one to crash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is why:\n\nUS households are absolutely jacked with car loans. As stated in this [article](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/american-debt-auto-loan-debt/), \" Auto loans now make up nearly 10% of all household debt, the third largest debt category behind mortgages and student loans. \" While this may not be that surprising, the point is these things are an extremely heavy burden for individuals. Additionally, cars are a significantly more liquid asset to sell than a home... more on this later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimilar to what was observed in the run-up to the housing market crash, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of sub-prime loans for automobiles. You can read about this [here](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/auto-loan-subprime-crisis/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssentially, what we are seeing in the auto industry is the same thing as the housing market: people are taking out way too large of loans they cannot afford.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How does this relate to the current state of the economy?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this being said, we know what happens when an economy is hurled into a recession. Companies layoff employees, debts stop being repaid, and people / businesses begin defaulting on their loans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince people are extremely leveraged on their car loans, any hiccup to their income may cause difficulty in repaying the loan. This will cause millions of car owners to either sell their car or it will get repossessed. Here is the intro to econ level analysis of how this scenario plays out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople lose jobs\n\n...................**This causes demand of used cars to increase**\n\nCan't afford car loan\n\nSell / get car repossessed\n\n...................**This causes supply of used cars to increase**\n\nThe increased supply and increased demand of used cars causes total quantity demanded to increase (rather dramatically, depending on your opinion of the future of the economy).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are only so many cars being sold around the country / world. With the quantity demanded of used cars increasing, the demand for new cars will decrease. As a result, firms such as GM and FCAU may struggle to stay in business, let alone make a profit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShort GM and FCAU... Also Wells Fargo seems interesting.",

        "selftext": "(This is from my personal investing notes. I wanted to put it out there and see if anyone feels the same)\n\nI realize that this journal entry got a bit lengthy, so I chopped it into three parts.\n\n----     \nThe Pump  \n-----     \n\nMid-January 2020, articles begin pumping TSLA as Musk announces share purchases.    \n    \n_Markets Insider -  Tesla short sellers have lost nearly $12 billion in just 7 weeks_     \n     \n_Markets Insider - Tesla has yet another biggest bull on Wall Street. Here's why he thinks the stock could surge 57%._    \n     \n_Electrek - Tesla (TSLA) gets new $800 price target based on its ability to execute_        \n     \nMusk is no stranger to stock pumping. Last year he advertised a private share price of 420$, \"funding secured\", to draw in investors. It is not surprising that this time the company has turned to media outlets to get article placement from a third party.    \n\nAt the same time, coordinated social media and message board posts appear hyping TSLA and urging users to buy stock. Social media posts on reddit, twitter, facebook about the price of Tesla on trajectory for $1000/share. A reddit and twitter user named /u/WSBgod begins buying calls in TSLA at $600+; posting his positions and urging his large follower base to do the same. Many of these social media posts are well-written, edgy and bear the hallmarks of professional  copywriters.    \n\n----    \nThe Dump    \n----   \nTesla price began to rise. Viral social media posts and positive articles created high demand for TSLA stock, driving retail investors into a frenzy. On some message boards, users were seen urging people to take credit card advances or student loans to buy Tesla stock at $600+.   \n\nAt this point, a short-term \"spike\" in Teslas price occured. For the purposes of discussion, we will consider $767 (the stock issue price, discussed below) at market close to be the defining price of the spike.   \n\nThis spike began on 02/03 and ended on 02/26. The stock market was open 18 days  during this window. More remarkably, the closing price of TSLA was only above $767 per share on *12 days* during the window.   \n*Chart of the 767$ price line and the recent spike*:   \nhttps://gfycat.com/quaintslimyeuropeanpolecat   \n\nIt turns out this short stock market spike was no surprise to Tesla. Tesla and Goldman Sachs were already preparing to issue stock during this narrow period. Tesla filed an 8-K on 02/19 to issue  2.65 million new shares at $767 per share. Teslas/Goldman's  \"luck\" allowed them to issue on one of the top ten highest dates in TSLA history.    \n\nSocial media and message board influencers sold dreams of $1500 \"moon\" prices to middle-class retail investors. Musk raked $2.31 billion of that cash advance, student loan, and summer job money during this short period of time. Many of his new investors were young; drawn by the new mobile-based, zero-commision brokers such as Robinhood. These younger investors typically turn to social media for their stock research.     \n\nWhile the stock issue was happening, Insiders began exercising options and dumping their stock. Five insiders can be seen exercising (buying) options and dumping stock during the narrow 18-day February spike time frame. Amidst the insider sales there is only one insider purchase - a well-publicized stock purchase by Elon Musk himself.     \n\nhttps://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TSLA/insider-trades/    \n\n----     \nThe wreckage settles     \n----     \n\nAfter the dump finished, the retail money was safely in the hands of insiders and Teslas cash reserves. Nameless large traders (known as \"whales\") began dumping the shares in high-volume batches, reaping the harvest of inflated stock price. The stock price plummetted. TSLA is now hovering around ~$400/share on 03/18, less than half the price of the all-time high where retail investors were paying upwards of $800-900 per share.    \n\nTesla is now $2.31 billion richer (although Tesla's high cash burn rate will incinerate this money within two quarters). Insiders at Tesla have gained hundreds of millions from their timely exit.    \n\nOn twitter and message boards, many users are depressed and downtrodden. The investment they purchased during the flurry of hype has lost its value. Many of the users who bought Tesla joke about suicide or selling their house. Many users who got caught in the Tesla hype are silent - ashamed of their losses. Many are selling their devalued shares at a huge loss and will not return to invest in stocks for the time being.      \n\nStock frenzys are not a new phenomenon. Many will blame the media for the unrealistic moonshot expectations towards TSLA during the hype period. Many will blame the drop in value of Tesla stock on the coronavirus (on the contrary, coronavirus was already worldwide during the \"pump\" period as well).     \n\nYet, it is tough not to look at the timing of the entire event and squint:    \n* Tesla insiders and the company issued and sold stock on the perfect dates during a very narrow 12 day window.    \n* The media blitz \"pump\" occured despite Teslas high debt load and extremely low car production rate (400k/year).     \n* Institutional investors stayed put and let retail investors run in to the slaughter, chasing promises of $1000+ TSLA    \n* Tesla issued shares and insiders dumped stock with a masterstroke in perfect timing and preparation     \n\nTLDR: The little guy got fleeced hard, and the corporation enriched itself by hitting the perfect dates on the roulette wheel.    \n\n\"Funding secured\"",

I was on WSB discord and EVERYONE was laughing at me when I said I was buying SPY calls. Well keep fucking laughing while your puts expire worthless tomorrow. Look at the charts and see for yourself.\n\nLets look at the 15 minute chart of the S&amp;P500. Inverse head and shoulders pattern, stocks going up. Buy calls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/onvps9fgbdk41.png?width=704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2db767e064c84977fc8f5f484dbfc38a33a316b1\n\nNow lets look at the daily chart below. The S&amp;P 500 chart today easily broke above the 200 DMA, that is a good sign for the bulls. Next resistance ahead is the 3139 level which is the 9 DMA.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryz6lgxxbdk41.png?width=704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=529ff7f83174621a9c3b3cfcdbd97b82c788abe3\n\nLets look at the 60 minute chart (below). There is some resistance at the red line around the 3129 level. This is close to the 3139 level on the daily chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6x4fgshccdk41.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7891a4beb11a11d1c36bd8fb0f21ad652a878f1\n\nSeems like tomorrow there will be a big resistance zone between the 3129-3139 level. If the S&amp;P 500 can break above that level, then the next resistance is 3168 (100 DMA), but honestly I think itll just shoot right over it and go for 3263 level (50 DMA). Here is the reason why, look at this last chart below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/03bf0e6scdk41.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=391838680758d0d004219ef805de917d0a6be9b4\n\nThis chart shows the ratio of puts to calls in the market.\n\nMore than 1 means more people buying puts. Anything above 1.1 is getting too risky and 1-sided. Anything above 1.2 is extreme\n\nLess than 1 means  more people buying calls. Anything below 0.8 is extreme.\n\nLook at this fucking chart, people are STILL holding onto their puts that were bought last week. The ratio today closed at 1.29, which is at the same level that we had on Thursday and Friday.\n\n**MOST PEOPLE HAVE NOT TAKEN PROFITS ON THEIR PUTS FROM LAST WEEK.**\n\nTomorrow the market will open higher and LOTS of people will be selling their puts to cut their losses, which will bring the market much higher. We will go way past the 100 DMA (3168 level), we just need to break above the strong 3129-3139 level, then we go to the moon.\n\nTLDR: Everyone in this subreddit is fucking autistic and is still holding puts (thanks to Robinhood).

        "selftext": "**How To GET PAID $2,000 Drop Servicing \\[Get Your High Ticket Client\\]**\n\nA big question I always get from students is how do I get clients to pay me. There\u2019s a few main things to focus on with this. Other than these points it\u2019s all about simply choosing your ideal platform and sending the invoice. Before you do that though, make sure you have these things in place so you don\u2019t run into the major issues I\u2019m about to expose.\n\n**How To Deal With Clients That Don\u2019t Want To Pay**\n\nAlways make sure that you don\u2019t deliver the finished product until the client has paid in full. I\u2019ve had a few experiences in the past where a client hasn\u2019t paid on time which led us not getting paid in full or not getting paid on time. The best way to deal with those who refuse to pay is to either require them to pay 100% up front before working with you or if you go for the 50% up front and 50% on delivery option, at least ensure you never deliver the final product, add your logo to it if it\u2019s something like a video, keep everything on your systems if it\u2019s something like a website.\n\n**How To Get High Paying clients**\n\nRealize your working in an abundant market, there are too many potential clients for you to possibly be able to service them all. There\u2019s plenty of fish in the sea, so you don\u2019t need to be desperate in taking whatever you can get someone to pay you. It all comes down to knowing what your service is worth in the market and charging what you deserve to be paid. If you\u2019re skilled in conveying your worth to clients in relation to a problem they really need to solve right now while you are the very best option to solve that problem then they\u2019re going to be willing to spend very large amounts to get that problem solved. On top of that you need to remember it\u2019s nothing for these companies to spend thousands with you, it\u2019s only a big deal for you if you\u2019re not used to it yet.\n\n**How Should Clients Pay Me**\n\nI\u2019ve heard of all kinds of strange payment structures over the years with all kinda of weird explanations for each. At the end of the day you should only get clients to pay you 100% up front or 50% up front, 50% on delivery if they really push on it. Personally, I only take this second option if the sales is worth at least $2,000 otherwise it\u2019s just not worth the time of going through two sets of receiving payments. The biggest thing is feeling comfortable asking for 100% payment upfront.\n\n**Payment Methods**\n\nThere\u2019s so many platforms out there for accepting payment all of which take some kind of fee. PayPal and Stripe make things simple but they both lead to higher fees expecting payments especially if your bank currency is different to the one you accept payment in. Bank transfer is another option but it can be slower to make happen and asks a bit more of the potential client when making payment as it\u2019s simply a little more work for them but if going this route I recommend using Transferwise to save massively on fees. It\u2019s really going to be a decision between minimizing fees or minimizing the time investment in your client making the payment, all dependent on your preferences in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Click HERE to learn more](https://youtu.be/hCCnhRKQw_0)",
