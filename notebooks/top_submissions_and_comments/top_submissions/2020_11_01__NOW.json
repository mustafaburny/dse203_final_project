SVM/??? here with another fuckin banger. LET'S GOOOO!!!!!\n\n# Introduction:\n\nThe market is going to tank. Let me just give a bit of background so you know why my opinion is better than yours...\n\nI am not a bear. I am not a bull. I go where the market tells me to go, I bet where it tells me to bet. And right now, the indicators are telling me to take a strong bearish position. So that's what I have been doing.\n\nI've been trading more than 20 years. I was trading the great financial crash while most of you were watching fucking Spongebob or whatever the fuck you kids jerked it to. This is not my primary job, but I make a good deal of cash on the side every month, timing the market and swing trading broad market ETFs. I do my research, I know my shit, and I rarely touch your shitty meme stocks. I'm doing you all a favor of once again sharing my insights into this market, so you too can share in my profits and maybe learn a thing or two.\n\nI will lay this out as cleanly as I can, offering multiple premises for my bearish bet and explaining them in detail. I've covered some of this in the past, but wanted to consolidate everything and more in one place. **This post will be long. If you want to cry about that rather than thank me for my service, you will go broke soon and deserve it cuz you are a lazy fuck.** PRESSING FORWARD!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Primary Bearish Premises:**\n\n**Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued (Macro)**\n\n**Premise 2: SPY is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes (TA)**\n\n**Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money You Retards (Facts)**\n\n**Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary (Theory)**\n\n**Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting (Data)**\n\n**Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks (Data)**\n\n**Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High (Data)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued\n\nThere are plenty of small, detail arguments for a bearish position. Covid cases rising, election uncertainty, stimulus failing, and so on. Plenty of others have made this case, so I won't focus on the small scale issues such as these.\n\nWhat I want to give you is a larger, macro picture. Because the market is simply overvalued, period. The market has become divorced from the overall economy. I understand tech, and why they have a bullish case for growth in the face of Covid lockdowns... My point here is that you need some REAL WORLD measures to tie \"future earnings\" down to reality, to prevent irrational euphoria from taking over your mind.\n\nThere are plenty of indicators out there showing that stocks are overvalued. We could talk about insane P/E ratios, about euphoric meme stock flops like NKLA, and so on. The metric I'm going to present here is not new by any stretch. It isn't unique or original. But it is undeniably useful, and carries strong weight, whether modern traders wish to shun it and its originator or not. I'm talking about the Buffet Indicator.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oem2uhz714061.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1f7e97544eba52859b986af68b4b80556660e43\n\nFor those of you new to this concept, it is simply the total stock market valuation divided by GDP. The point is to compare total market valuations with some hard, trailing, real-world metric, in this case GDP. When market valuations uncouple strongly from actual market conditions, it is a strong signal of irrational stock valuations. And that presents opportunity for those paying attention.\n\nNote that **this chart has already been detrended down to account for historically rising P/E ratios**, and it still shows a strongly overvalued market, equal to what was seen during the DotCom bubble. That's bad news, folks.\n\nThis is the REAL issue in the present market, and why buyers are becoming exhausted. Covid, instability, elections, stimulus... These are all just catalysts to give that equity bubble a little prick. Only the dumbest of the dumb are still \"buying the dip\" under current market conditions, which means mostly clueless retail gamblers on WSB. All these perma-bulls are doing is offering liquidity to the institutional investors to help get them out of their positions. In the end, we all know who is left holding the bag.\n\n# Premise 2: The Market is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes\n\nI'm not a big believer in technical analysis. Most of it is bullshit, astrological voodoo if you ask me. But some of it works, and when technical analysis works, it is simply being used as a proxy for assessing market sentiment and emotions. Let's take a closer look at the teaser SPY chart I posted above.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h0ndq2a914061.png?width=1808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fe30a5ad23952719c69c6634debe7fe8c0832af\n\nAs you can see, the market has been repeatedly rejecting multiple new highs. This process was briefly interrupted by positive vaccine news. We breached a new high on Pfizer vaccine results, but even that new high was instantly rejected and resulted in a sudden reversal selloff. The Moderna vaccine news created another short rally, lower than the Pfizer high, and that too was followed by a selloff. **In other words, the market is continually rejecting current market valuations.** As they should be, if you were following the point above. We are running on vaccine news fumes, and those will not last long. If you develop an instinct for these things, you can almost feel it in your gut: The market WANTS to head down.\n\nIf this isn't the top, it is close to it. $366.77 will very likely be the high for SPY for the year, and will soon unwind downwards.\n\n# Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money\n\nI know this will come as a shock to most of you idiots but the fucking money printer does NOT GO BRRRRR.\n\nThe Fed has to follow the laws that govern it's actions. The Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print cash and hand it out. Go ahead and read the Federal Reserve Act, and take a look at the Fed's actions, for proof of this. It doesn't even have the authority to print cash to buy corporate bonds or anything else.\n\nWhat the Fed \"prints\" is called \"reserves.\"\n\n[ Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/8ibo0kud14061.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=626a1464cd76296ee9d435a5c69f182e4286f9d6)\n\nSo what, you say? So everything. The key point about reserves is that they cannot be spent like cash can. When a bank gets reserve funds in its reserve account at the Fed, it CANNOT SPEND that money. All the bank can do is use that account as collateral to lend against. Which means **if the banks are not lending, those QE funds are NOT entering the economy.** They might as well not exist. And banks are not lending, as we will see below.\n\nThis is the counter argument to all the ignorant retail traders who will argue that the Fed is \"backstopping\" stocks, or that the Fed will not \"allow\" the market to crash. The Fed has no power to print money, and therefore no power to buy stocks, and therefore no power to prevent a crash. The Fed's power is illusory, but enough people buy the illusion to make it effective. That won't last forever.\n\nJust think about it. If Fed actions and QE really made stocks rally the way people claim it does, why isn't the Japan Nikkei constantly breaking new all time highs???\n\n# Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary\n\nQuantitative Easing is not Cash. In fact, QE is deflationary.\n\nHere is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against.\n\nIn fact, it's worse than that. Because the Fed is removing assets from the open market, and not paying cash for them. It is purchasing liquid assets with illiquid reserves. Despite all the Fed's talk about \"creating liquidity,\" what the Fed is actually doing is REMOVING liquidity from the system!\n\nWhy would they do this? Answer: To lower interest rates. Don't take my word for it, the Fed explains this itself!\n\n[ Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained ](https://preview.redd.it/bzl5jfpf14061.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4c96c8e3b741867281f43b5472c634c85cba5bf)\n\nSee, the Fed has to follow the laws that govern its actions. Despite what the public believes, the Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print money and hand it out. The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through **credit expansion.** So the Fed does everything it can to reduce interest rates, both by setting reserve rates near zero and by using QE to drive rates down further.\n\nOnly when credit expansion revives will we begin to see inflation and a true recovery. The Fed knows their hands are tied, which is why they keep hammering Congress to pass more stimulus.\n\nPerhaps the greatest strength of the Fed is in \"forward guidance.\" The Fed simply uses words to convince the public that money is being printed, that inflation is coming, so that people go out and spend and buy assets. They are playing a trick on the public, and the trick is working. People actually believe inflation is coming, that stocks are being held up by the Fed, that money is pouring into the system. The public is wrong on every count.\n\nThe Fed is trying to contract credit markets in order to lower interest rates in order to eventually spur lending in order to eventually create inflation. But in the meantime, QE is deflationary. As stated above, if reserve funds are not being lent out by the banks, they do not enter the economy, and thus QE serves a deflationary role. Let's take a look at the next premise, that banks are contracting the credit markets.\n\n# Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting\n\nThe question of whether banks are lending or not with their QE reserves is simply a matter of looking at the data. Practically every data source we can point to suggests contracting credit conditions. This means QE reserves are not entering the economy, and therefore are not producing inflation nor holding up stocks.\n\n**The SLOOS data from the Fed, Oct. 2020:**\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/data\\/sloos\\/sloos-202010-table-1.htm](https://preview.redd.it/pt6xz8wg14061.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4de834db13e36878f58154dbe44010b2777743b0)\n\nReal Estate lending is booming, you say? Not so....\n\n**Banks Lending is TIGHTENING:**\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/data\\/documents\\/sloos-202010-charts.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/95wkopaj14061.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb6dcc0329897ca807477b5506786e5edba4b70e)\n\nNote: The decline near the end doesn't represent growth in credit, but represents a reduction in the RATE of tightening.\n\n**Consumer Demand for Loans is SHRINKING:**\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/data\\/documents\\/sloos-202010-charts.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/6d29h9dk14061.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73842070279db79f47a95b1d5c5b1eaeaef08498)\n\n**Even Credit Card debt growth is negative!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73j9n0fl14061.png?width=1585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6328ef22e4a84f0a32b419c35eeacc5238911d24\n\n# Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks\n\nIf you are like me, you look forward to the H.8 data every Friday from the Fed (yeah right haha). A continuing trend in that data, month after month after month, is that major banks in the US have been loading up on bonds with no end in sight. They are piling more and more cash into safe assets, now up to a whopping $4.6 TRILLION in securities.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/releases\\/h8\\/current\\/default.htm](https://preview.redd.it/tn38ss3p14061.png?width=1219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc1c06695685a883599315abc9e36047128e687)\n\nMeanwhile, retail traders (that means you) keep piling into stocks at all time highs. A record amount of cash was dumped into the market after the vaccine news breaks. I'm just gonna go ahead and call it now. This is the top.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.bloomberg.com\\/news\\/articles\\/2020-11-13\\/stock-funds-get-record-44-5-billion-inflows-on-vaccine-optimism](https://preview.redd.it/xogj0z2q14061.png?width=1314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c466b29277d6f047781fd9156bd476b3b1c011f1)\n\n# Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High\n\nI bring this up just to reiterate another real-world metric that is gloomy as fuck and yet completely ignored from market valuations. Why are stocks breaking all-time highs when we still have MILLIONS more unemployed than we did this time last year? Hello McFly?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jda435zq14061.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3929064c0e9d6ae120201ad4295e02cca2bdcf45\n\n# Conclusion:\n\n**Shit's fucked up son.** Real world economy is still in shambles. Market is more overvalued than it was during the DotCom boom. Still millions unemployed. The market is topping off and rejecting highs again and again. The Fed is not printing money and not backstopping assets, despite claims to the contrary. We are heading down, folks!\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**SPY 350p 12/18**\n\n**VXX 22c 12/18**\n\nAlso anything else that strikes your fancy. IWM, GLD, SLV puts are all fine (dollar is going to rise). Longer dated TLT calls will print as well due to QE reducing bond yields, eventually. Go longer or shorted dated depending on personal risk tolerance.\n\n**Timing can be difficult. My strategy is to periodically enter bearish positions when short-term indicators look good, and hope to eventually time the major dump. If things begin to stabilize short-term I exit the position quickly with a small gain or, rarely, a small loss.**\n\nSee: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkm5jq/the\\_bears\\_arent\\_done\\_folks\\_these\\_diamond\\_hands/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkm5jq/the_bears_arent_done_folks_these_diamond_hands/)",

        "selftext": "There's really nothing more to say. I haven't been happy in my 1 year-relationship. My girlfriend probably moved in with me with the expectation that I'll **pay her $40k Nursing School debt THAT SHE NEVER EVEN GRADUATED FROM (and she never told me about this debt**)**.** She was working as a receptionist but quit when we moved in because of 'mental health issues'. \n\nHonestly I've taken her to a psychologist, cared for her, even took some leave just to spend time with her and help her recover. I give her alone time when she asks for it. And when I'm at home, I always do the chores and ask her if she's game to go eat something nice and spend more time together.\n\nOne day, I pull up to our condo and my door is open. I see some other *fucking guy* leaving my house, and he looks like he's been on a million different drugs.\n\nPissed, I tell ask her about it and she gets angry at me, asking me why I'm never home and why I always abuse her. She dodges the question over and over and says that it's just 'a friend' she opened the door to because no one was home to keep her company. This happens about 2 more times and one day, I confront the guy in the front door and turns out he's '**rented**'. \n\nFirst off. Where did she get the money? Has she been renting guys out with the little \"salary\" I'm giving her to spend while I'm working my ass off  providing for both of us? I'm a freaking security guard earning $19 CAD/hr. Which is not bad but not sustainable for a marriage where one person pays for two.\n\nI was pissed to hell. \n\nThere was something she didn't know about, though. I've been stashing away a little bit of money, starting with 5K CAD after finding about this reddit site. At that time, I was honestly depressed because I had a hard time paying for our condo and with debt. And perhaps that fueled me with all-inning that 5K with a PLTR options play (call) that expired Nov 27, 2020. Oct 30, 2020 when I bought multiple calls for PLTR it rockets all the way to **wakanda** and to **jupiter**. I'm now 1012% up. I cash out before Citron sell it. **(DW I'll add that money to buying PLTR STOCKS**, less riskier than doing options). \n\n***How does this relate to my girlfriend?***\n\nIt relates. It relates because I'm going to leave her fucking ass. Actually, even if PLTR doesn't his $40 I'm STILL going to leave her ass. I have to pay spousal support but when I looked at the calculator online, it amounts to about $82 per month for **0.5** to **1 year**. I'll do it and then cut all ties. And that bitch'll have to handle her debt herself. I'll cut all ties and leave without a fuckin word. \n\nIt's not like we were married or anything. It's not like we are obligated to one another. I haven't committed to her through marriage. And this is my decision. \n\nSo her, that guy, and CITRON, can go suck my hard cock throbbing because of the 5k liters of blood that gushed in, making it hard, when I saw PLTR go from $10.12/share to \\~$27-\\~32/share. Goodbye and I'll see you Monday when that shit pumps to the moon and beyond.",

        "selftext": "[I made the CIIC DD last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jwoakc/the_next_ev_play_ciic_and_arrival_merger/) when it was $12, there was no mention of CIIC anywhere (I monitor daily threads). [Today it is at $22](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ciic).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all these EV stocks popping up, \n\n# my next play is the merger of $THCB and Microvast \n\n([Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-11-13/tuscan-holdings-corp-announces-intent-to-combine-with-microvast-inc)). You might say, the merger isn't confirmed yet. That is true, but that's how you maximize profit before the news sets in. Bloomberg has never been wrong about any SPAC rumour except once (Topgolf). THCB will be able to sign an extension by Dec 3rd, likely to be beforehand)\n\nRight now, without an agreement confirmation, $THCB has barely popped yet, shares and warrants are still cheap. There is virtually 0 downside risk, THCB shares are currently at $10.44, like most SPACs, you can redeem shares to $10 cash if it fails through, which is unlikely to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So what is Microvast?**\n\nTLDR: EV Battery Maker based in Texas, business focuses in Asia (China market is $$). One of the best EV battery techs right now. Already has 100M revenue this year.\n\nIt makes EV batteries based on Lithium Titanium Oxide (LTO) chemistry. Compared to the incumbent Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries, Microvast's batteries have longer life, shorter charging times, and offer substantial lower cost of ownership by eliminating swapping station infrastructures required by buses running on LFP batteries.\n\n[Their batteries powered the electric buses used in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, it expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue this financial year.](https://www.reuters.com/article/microvast-ma-tuscan-holdings/ev-battery-maker-microvast-to-go-public-through-spac-merger-idINL4N2HZ3SI) Most other EV companies don't even have revenue yet. [THCB has a Return On Equity of 48.48%. This is amongst the best returns in the industry. The industry average is 11.30%. THCB outperforms 85% of its industry peers.](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/analyzer/stock/THCB?view=fundamental-analysis&amp;utm_source=stocktwits&amp;utm_medium=FA&amp;utm_content=THCB&amp;utm_campaign=social_tracking)\n\nIf you missed out on CIIC train, this will be the next hype play. I don't expect it to have big jumps in the next few days, but the merger agreement with Microvast should come out within the next 2 weeks. Get in early before it comes out and jumps up 50%. Shares and warrants are both cheap as fuck right now. Once merger is announced, THCB will easily go to \\~$20 range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: Load up on THCB shares and warrants. (I am going 30|70).",

        "selftext": "Institutional ownership in this company went from 1% to almost 8% within a week(because it was a Direct Listing) and looking at the price charts, their average purchase range should be around $13-15.\n\nThis gives a floor for us retail investors and speculators out there. Price is UNLIKELY to go below this floor.\n\nMore institutional ownership is quite probably coming soon. This means money.\n\nARK, Soros sold a stake in JPM(probably, I forgot) to jump in PLTR.\n\nMorgan Stanley raised the price target yet downgraded the stock, I don't know if it\u2019s a dick move from their part to try to buy it at a lower price or maybe I am just over thinking.\n\nLong term considerations:\nThis company is structured in a way in which the founders would gain insane amount of money if this stock prints(KINDA like how Musk benefitted from TSLA stock price)\n\nPlus the total control of the founders(much like lizard man Zuck have over FB) mean shareholders cannot pull any funny business. This is significantly advantageous for PLTR for the business that it is in and the groupthink prevalent among tech workers.\n\nThey still don't have any direct competitor(not that I know of) and will have a revenue of $1B+ whereas their total addressable market size is $120B(somewhere near that ballpark, I read the SEC filings when they IPOed, but forgot the numbers and since they are building more and more products could increase TAM further).\n\nTheir software is infinitely adjustable and boy have you seen their customer retention and horizontal growth rate when they make a company Palantir's customer.\n\nIf you go to their Investors Relations website, you will see the numerous ways they are helping clients. One example, an oil major would save $1B annually for using Palantir's software.\n\nThey have an almost 10+ years head start in the business and the fact that it\u2019s so deeply entrenched with the government means it ain't gonna become bankrupt.\n\nI mean this shit can surpass NFLX or TSLA valuations if Karp's vision and various statements are realised.\n\nAlso remember, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp do not just work for money, they already have had a boatload(literally) of money and for them to stick to a product for nearly 17 years is definitely telling.\n\nThis company probably wouldn\u2019t enter the Chinese market or more likely wouldn\u2019t take any Chinese government contract.\n\nTheir margins are insane(forget NFLX, AAPL, TSLA etc) when their customers enter the scaling phase and their products are sticky as hell.\n\nShort term considerations:\nThere's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares.\n\nRegardless, a lot of employees could exercise options constantly that they received as compensations as they didn\u2019t get the chance to do so earlier at a fair price.\n\nThey raised their guidance. And do you know what market loves the most? Raised guidance. That's why even though market sold off by retail profit takers at first then it quickly went back to where it was. Monday could be higher.\n\nThis stock probably hasn\u2019t really discovered its true pricing because of the still low institutional ownership and employees stock options activity.\n\nThe market(by market I mean some journos and analysts) still seems to misunderstand their product and think they are a data mining company, a consultant company, a fancy government contractor for specialist software etc. It is not any of them. I will let you discover yourself what this company is. It's kind of like how some boomer analysts still think a certain company is just a car company.\n\nHow to play this shit?\nI think leaps or outright buying shares(then selling puts to generate income and buy more) is the best way, regardless, this is a matter I don't want to comment too much, I have given you some insight, now you do your own thing.\n\nRemember, this isn\u2019t NIO, it\u2019s a much more bigger fish than that(if they can realise their long term goals).\n\nSome resources for you to dive slightly deep.\n\n[Third quarter earnings presentation(pdf)](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf)\n\n[Palantir S-1 Filing(SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)\n\n[STILL low institutional ownership](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PLTR&amp;subView=institutional)",

        "selftext": "I am someone who has spent over a decade in hedge funds and then in private equity\n\nIf you want to understand what it is going on. You have to understand that the largest driving force in the background in which you are operating in is the shift from active managers to passive managers. The vanguard crowd has been winning for more than a decade and now we are at a point where nearly all new money entering the market comes in the form of passive ETFs and index funds. \n\nAnd here is where the fun begins. millennials and new investors have a extreme time preference for passive management while baby boomers largely invested in active managers. So in the past few years, all new money entering the market is passive and all old money leaving the market is active. Hedge fund and mutual fund managers are shedding AUM while the likes of vanguard and ETFs have been gaining AUM.\n\n So why does this matter?\n\nWell, the old operating model of securities analysis was predicated on value judgements. If a stock falls 20%, your money manager tasks a analyst to runs a DCF/comps analysis, and tells you it is undervalued by 10% based on the latest assessment, and that the fund should buy some shares. The old buy high sell low, with a dash of analysis added in. That was how things use to run anyways. But in the world of passive investing, price becomes the only judgement as to whether it should be added or subtracted, there is no analysis of valuation metrics, fundamentals of the business or even if it is a fraud or not. There are no analysts digging into the company, calling up suppliers, doing channel checks. It is just pure automation, stock goes up, it gets reweighted high, buy. Stock goes down, it gets reweighted down, sell. The market has become dumber over time. And the people who do the work do not get paid for it, because more and more of the market is passive. So undervalued things remain undervalued, and overvalued things get more overvalued. \n\nThere are essentially three players left in this market, of which only two are active investors. You have the passive money, which now drives 90%+ of the market. You have the small remaining active investor base, who have been shedding AUM and are desperate to hold on to their jobs and are forced to actually follow indexes to avoid getting fired, and what their doing which is arbitraging value, no longer pays off. Then you have people like WSB and stocktwits, where people chase momentum in everything from large tech to chinese frauds. What you are seeing today is the two remaining active groups fighting to control the flows of the passive money (who simply follows whichever side has more momentum). \n\nThis is why we are in a world where TESLA can go up valuation by 10x despite revenue only increase by 15%. We are in a world where large cap gets larger. We are in a world where a bunch of degenerates gambling on FDs, which then drives gamma covering by market makers will create an escalating feedback loop in which passive money piles in, making it into a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nSo thank the Bogleheads, you have the keys to the Asylum. You are now running the trillion dollar global equity markets. The memes are now real and you are now the captain of Wall Street.",

How does this happen? Shares can be borrowed, sold, then borrowed from the buyer (making two people technically borrowing the same 1 share). This is insane and has never happened before without causing a short squeeze. (look up volkswagen short squeeze chart to see what it looks like when short interest exceeds 100%). \n\n[https:\\/\\/finance.yahoo.com\\/quote\\/GME\\/key-statistics?p=GME](https://preview.redd.it/n8sr8ifnww161.png?width=840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f3ef131a7d5bdee19acd4c6bd8196fad9c66aa)\n\nSo if gamestop stock goes up, the shorts will have to cover, which is literally impossible since theyve shorted over 100% of shares, so the price will be driven to an absolute retard height. But, whats gonna make gamestop go up? how are the shorts wrong?\n\n**Consoles**\n\nWell, the obvious is console sales, but thats not really it. Yes, the consoles will help, however more importantly there are key indicators that gamestop is not going bankrupt. Recently, they just paid off a metric fuckton of debt *voluntarily* which means they have the cash to do that, aka not bankrupt. People are literally camping out at gamestop for consoles. They will not struggle.\n\n**Cohen**\n\nAlso, they are getting the help from ryan cohen, who successfully competed with amazon by launching an online pet store called Chewy, which made him a billionaire. This is good news for gamestop because he will help pivot them from brick and mortar towards a more digital world, which means gamestop now has realistic growth prospects. Also, there is rumors that cohen will announce a tender offer, which would immediately trigger a short squeeze, end of story. Cohen has openly critiqued the BoD about their '20th century mindset' so it is likely he is going to take over soon. \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Also, massive completely random spikes in volume off seemingly no news indicate that cohen is buying up shares. ](https://preview.redd.it/e19xcu0qxw161.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f7c9aeb4df33cc2d416f7fda3b2e8ee257cc43)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positioning**\n\nThey have also positioned themselves to benefit from non traditional 'brick and mortar' revenue streams. Another thing that gamestop has is online revenue sharing with sony, which means they will be benefiting from digital game sales. They also just announced that they would be selling TVs on their website, showing that they are positioning themselves to compete as an online retailer. \n\n[https:\\/\\/www.theverge.com\\/2020\\/10\\/15\\/21517970\\/gamestop-revenue-sharing-microsoft-xbox-digital-downloads-games](https://preview.redd.it/cijd0o25xw161.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=310955852b0224bfff2fc36825d50a741475f46c)\n\n[https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/)\n\n\\^Link about TVs. \n\n**The move:**\n\nBuy as many shares as you can and hold. Set a limit sell on all your shares for at least $500, to make sure that you dont miss the squeeze. That alone would be a 3,233% gain.  \n\nImportant note: This quarters earnings will likely not be a catalyst for a short squeeze. It is likely that there will be a run up and then small dump after.

        "selftext": "Why should you listen to me? I'm either a licensed pharmacist who makes a living analyzing clinical outcomes data or a full-blown autist who has lost thousands making reckless plays (I'm actually both)\n\nSo I was looking through Pfizer\u2019s well-guarded Phase 3 COVID vaccine data and came to the following conclusions:\n\nPfizer stated they achieved an incredible \u201c90% efficacy\u201d in the trial which has enrolled 43,538 patients, 38,955 of which received both required doses. But what does \u201c90% efficacy\u201d really mean? They are referring to the \u2018Relative Risk Reduction\u2019 which is a number with no external validity. Essentially, RRR, is a way to inflate what the real-world effectiveness of an intervention is by removing the good outcomes of the non-intervention arm of a trial. It is the incidence difference between the placebo and intervention arms, divided by the incidence difference of the intervention arm.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a 2% chance of having a brick fall and hit you in the head, but there is an intervention available that reduces your risk of a brick hitting you in the head from 2% to 1%. The RRR = (2% - 1%) / 2% = 50%. When in reality, your absolute risk is reduced by 1% (ARR = 2% - 1% = 1%). \n\nNow let\u2019s apply this to the Pfizer data. Pfizer only reported a few numbers: 90% effective, 94 positive cases in both arms, and 38955 patients receiving both doses. Trial arm splits are always very close to 50/50, and knowing those 3 numbers, we can do some math and come to the following data table:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Placebo (No Vaccine)| Intervention (Vaccine) |\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|COVID Cases |85|9|\n|Enrolled |19,388|19,567|\n|Outcome Incidence  | 0.438416% | 0.045996% |\n\nAs a double-check, the RRR = (0.438416% - 0.045996%) / 0.438416% = 89.5% (round up to 90%)\n\nBut let\u2019s dive a little deeper. Based on this trial, there is a 0.44% chance to contract COVID-19 without the vaccine, and a 0.046% chance to contract COVID-19 with the vaccine. Your absolute risk reduction would be 0.39%, which means getting the COVID-19 vaccine reduces your chance of contracting the disease by 0.39% (0.0039). \n\nSo how many vaccines would we have to give to prevent 1 COVID case? This is called a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and provides the number of interventions (vaccines) required to prevent one outcome (infection). NNT is calculated as 1/ARR, then rounding up to the next highest whole number. The NNT for Pfizer\u2019s vaccines = 1/0.0039 = 256.4 = 257 patients must receive both vaccines in order to prevent one case. Sounds bad, right? Well, it gets worse. Roughly 7% of each COVID case leads to a hospitalization, and roughly 2% of cases lead to death. This means that to prevent 1 hospitalization, 3,672 patients must receive both vaccines (257 / 0.07), and to prevent 1 death, 12,580 patients must receive both vaccines (257 / 0.02). \n\nThe intervention arm in this trial, at best, prevented 1.6 deaths (19,567 / 12,580). \n\nTo prevent the roughly 240,000 COVID deaths in the US, over 3 billion vaccines would have to be given (240,000 x 12,580). \n\nGuess what? Yeah, it still gets worse. The primary outcome of this trial was a COVID-19 infection within SEVEN DAYS OF THE SECOND VACCINE. So technically speaking, any effectiveness of this vaccine is only for 7 days and you could essentially be completely vulnerable again (this likely isn\u2019t the case, but still is still a possibility). \n\nModerna's data ain't much better. Their NNT is roughly 177. \n\nI didn't even mention the supply chain nightmare Pfizer's vaccine will cause since it needs to be stored at -70^(o)F.\n\nHere is more bad news, there is virtually no long-term safety data available for these vaccines. Long story short, The FDA isn't going to approve this anytime soon. \n\nPositions: $SPY $325p 3/31/21, $PFE $30p 7/16/21, $MRNA $50p 1/21/22",

        "selftext": "Posting on a throwaway account, for obvious reasons.\n\nIn 2013, my uncle passed away from pancreatic cancer.  In his will, he left my twin brother and I  $100,000 each.  \n\nMy brother and I were talking about our different investments at the time, and how we were going to invest our new money.  For the last decade or so, I\u2019ve been a silver enthusiast, and I argued that silver was, IMO, the best alternative investment to stocks and bonds.  He had just learned about Bitcoin and was adamant that the return could be exponential.  I had vehemently argued against Bitcoin, saying that it was pure speculation and would be a total waste of money.  I was so sure that Bitcoin would crash.\n\nWell, he ended up investing about 50k into Bitcoin around then (when Bitcoin was ~$100 each), for over 500 coins.  I, on the other, invested most of it into stocks, and about 30k into silver.  \n\nHis 50k Bitcoin investment, which was made within months of the same time as my 30k silver investment, is now worth over $10 million.  My 30k silver investment  in 2013 is now worth about 26k, with my entire net worth below 100k.  His wealth in Bitcoin alone is more than 100 times greater than my entire net worth.  \n\nHe has never sold any of his Bitcoins.  He\u2019s never even traded them for other crypto currencies.  His job pays him very well, so he\u2019s never really had liquidity issues.  He has still 500+ coins, and he\u2019s going to retire soon.  He is planning to sell his house, travel, and live as an investor. \n\nNow, he did give me one Bitcoin.  And I will not sell it.  As happy as I am for him, though, it really hurts to hear about his fortune and bright future, and not be jealous.  I\u2019ve stopped attending family events (him too), because I can\u2019t get over the overwhelming thought of \u201chey, you should\u2019ve done what your brother did\u201d, at every waking moment.  It\u2019s extremely depressing.  I try to be thankful for what I do have, and I try to be thankful since I know that many other people in the world have it way worse.  But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get over it.  The thought that\n\u201cif you made the same investment, you wouldn\u2019t have to work anymore\u201d always comes to me, in every area of my life.  I always think to myself, you wouldn\u2019t have to work, or you wouldn\u2019t have money issues like this if you just invested a little into Bitcoin.  This thought is especially pervasive whenever I\u2019m at work, and it is a crushing feeling.  \n\nAny advice on how to cope?",

Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional merger is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long term holding of the company and is referenced in the \"tontine\" name - look it up, pretty cool.\n\n\\- Ackman has given several interviews since the listing of PSTH arguing that they are very well positioned to target and capture a unicorn (large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company.) Early speculation included AirBnB. While Ackman held talks with the company, they didn\u2019t get to the point where his people got an inside look at the financials and he basically said they had no idea what they were dealing with despite liking how the company looked on the outside. AirBnB now, for many reasons remains unlikely.\n\n\\- Ackman in the same videos talked up Stripe as a quality company but one not ready to go public, specifically citing managerial deficits.\n\n\\- Stripe has been talked up by some in the press as the next Google. They control a large percentage of online payments at present.\n\n\\- Ackman has publicly disclosed his biggest misses as companies that make money based on money, giving Visa/Mastercard as the obvious example.\n\n\\- In the weeks since those interviews, several key events have taken place as follows:\n\no Following Ackman comments, Stripe initiates a dramatic position filling hiring spree with focus on positions needed to go public/SPAC\n\no Square executive joins board of PSTH\n\no Seth Klarman ($30B hedge fund manager \u201cthe next Buffet\u201d and noted value investor, disclosed a $400M position in PSTH).\n\no Warren Buffet has slashed his JPM position almost entirely.\n\no Warren Buffet is secretly building a large position and hiding it from the press/pushing filing deadlines as much as possible.\n\no There is a large and undisclosed PSTH somewhere in the market that is not Klarman\u2019s.\n\no In recent days the pre-market movement has been very odd. Several million positions. Pre-market on Friday for example, stock was up nearly 9% for some of the morning. Has consistently hit after-market highs the next day. The data is trending in a very clear direction.\n\nRelevant Documents/Links:\n\n\\- Ackman interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4)\n\n\\- Klarman position: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html)\n\n\\- Buffet leaves JPM: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193)\n\n\\- Buffet secret position: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html)\n\n\\- PSTH (Ackman) recent letter to investors, see PSTH section: [https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf](https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf)\n\n\\- Yolo Capital Mgmt twitter feed outlining much of the same events: [https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt](https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt)\n\nIn the end, we don\u2019t know anything for sure but the evidence here (there is more to dig up, see [u/YOLO](https://new.reddit.com/u/YOLO/), is very compelling). Holding a stake here, whether its Stripe or something else, is likely a play with limited downside and insane upside. The warrant structure (\u201cTontine\u201d) alone is so appealing.\n\nGoodluck.\n\n\\-commons (long-term) and contracts (June 21)",

        "selftext": "I have done previously succesful DDs so I am not just talking shit. \n\nWe all know Gamestop is going to crash it's business model is dead. But so does everyone else. In fact nearly everyone is shorting the shit out of it. Even your wife's bf and Cramer is shorting the fuck out of it. \n\n[There is more shorts than outstanding shares!](https://preview.redd.it/up5ukv9180261.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb5140a7bd7a1d84494f89d99d2d792e3b6a267)\n\nThere are just a bit more shorts than outstanding shares, and nearly 3 times more than the floating shares. Which means those assholes will need to close their positions and buy back their shares. But what is going to happen is that there is not enough supply float. So the price will skyrocket faster than PLTR or NIO or any other meme in 2020.\n\nRight but what if they don't want to close their shorts all at once. Then nothing happens, right? Yes... and no. As they start buying back the price will rise slowly and some people that did not want to buy will at some point get a margin call. This will force more short sellers to buy (at a lose cause fuck gay bears). And this will accelerate the rising of the price creating more margin calls and so on and so on. Until we run out of short sellers trying to buy. At this point the price will stop increasing. Basically, we only need a small (comapared to 22.70 Mill) amount of people buying to trigger this.\n\nSo there is still a thing that needs to happen a small amount of people need to suddenly buy or close the shorting positions. For the price to start going up. Then here is the best part. GME earnings are happening on the 8th of December. Two things can happen either they ace it and people start buying or they screw it up and the price goes down.\n\nFirst scenario it's golden the price starts rolling and GME goes to the moon. The second one sounds bad, right? No, if the price drops by 20% some people might start closing their shorts. Then as that happens the price will bounce back and start the process again.\n\nBasically GME is a ball at the top of the hill right now. If only a bit of wind blows is going to start rolling.\n\nNot only that but imagine if we all buy some shares we can show the market who is in control! Fuck Cramer fuck the bears. It is only 22 million shares, we are 1.6m we could even trigger the squeeze if we wanted to...",

        "selftext": "Reading through some of the posts I can see how a lot of newbies have FOMO (fear of missing out). Post after post of losers making huge returns. Everyone is getting rich but you. Boofuckinghoo. The smart investor realizes it\u2019s all hype. Some of it works, most of it doesn\u2019t. To be successful you need to be able to recognize the difference and to do that, you need time, knowledge and practice. \n\nHere are ten tips that can help you along the way. \n\n**Tip 1 - You don\u2019t know shit**\n\nYou\u2019re going to lose your money. Don\u2019t get suckered by reading posts about guys who made 1000% return in 5 minutes. For every one guy that posts his massive gains, 100+ suckers have lost their money. The first lesson to realize is that it\u2019s way easier to lose money in the market than to make money. \n\n**Tip 2 - Understand how money flows in the market**\n\nMoney moves from the idiots to the knowledgable, from the impatient to the patient. Any dummy can make money short term. But to make money long-term and truly grow a portfolio, you have to be armed with knowledge and a shit ton of patience. \n\n**Tip 3 - Play for the long term**\n\nThe most important rule you need to follow religiously is NEVER FUCKING LOSE MONEY. Print it big, tape it to your wall. Your top responsibility is protecting your capital. YOLO is a stupid play. 99% of you are going to bet at the wrong time with the wrong stock. Calm the fuck down and work on a long term strategy. You have decades dummy. \n\n**Tip 4 - Time is on your side, but not much else**\n\nThe market never stops. The machine just churns and churns. Rich to poor, poor to rich, it just keeps on turning and turning. There are ALWAYS opportunities. Another IPO. Another MEME turd. FOMO is for fools. Miss a run? Big fucking deal. There\u2019s another one around the corner. You have plenty of time to learn, test, and grow your capital. \n\n**Tip 5 - Paper Trading**\n\nPaper trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with real active data but it\u2019s all practice. No real money exchanges. It\u2019s a great way to learn, to see how shitty you\u2019re going to do without losing a penny. DO THIS FOR TWO YEARS. Take whatever capital you have right now and buy some long term ETFs or solid ass stocks with minimal risk. Keep adding to it EVERY paycheck. Build up some capital for when you\u2019re ready to trade for real. Take two years to learn how to trade, watch your paper portfolio go to zero a couple dozen times, read and follow the news, WSB, Stocktwits, etc. Ask questions, test out your strategies. You\u2019ll thank me two years from now. \n\n**Tip 6 - Understand taxes**\n\nBig difference between short term and long term capital gains. Uncle Sam loves you short timers. Paying taxes is for suckers. \n\n**Tip 7 - No one knows shit**\n\nThere is no crystal ball, no one has the \u201cinside track\u201d, and only believe 10% of what you read. Be very fucking skeptical. About everything. Social media, analysts, CEOs, news, all if it, be fucking skeptical. It\u2019s all manipulation. Don\u2019t even trust Buffett. You are the guardian of your capital. Everyone wants to take it it away from you. Understand that and you won\u2019t get suckered so easily. \n\n**Tip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations**\n\nAs much as the market today feels like a casino, the underlying foundation of the market is investing, not gambling. With every stock you buy you\u2019re buying a piece of a business. Learn to read fundamentals. Do they make money? Are they growing? Do they have debt? How are their competitors valued? Do they make more money today than they did 5 years ago? How will they make more? How do they return capital to shareholders? And on and on and on. Learn motherfuckers. Earnings per share. P/E rations. Intrinsic value. Net income. Figure out formulas for valuing stocks. Is TSLA worth over 250x earnings? Is WFC undervalued at 13x earnings? Investing blindly because big\\_dick\\_loser said so in a post is beyond idiotic. Just burn your money, you\u2019ll have more fun. \n\n**Tip 9 - Get rich schemes are for suckers**\n\nRemove the bookmark for Ferrari. You ain\u2019t getting one anytime soon. Play fucking smart. Go long. Think in decades, not days. You\u2019re not smart enough to day trade and beat the system. Not long-term anyways. Most of you won\u2019t beat the market over 10 years. So be fucking smart. Paper trade until you can consistently prove gains month after month. When you\u2019re ready to trade for real, dip in slowly. Fuck FOMO. Fuck YOLO. Remember, time is on your side. Compound that shit. \n\n**Tip 10 - Discipline and dedication**\n\nLike anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it. Easy money never lasts. Dig in, learn, practice, rinse and repeat. Be motivated to learn how to invest, take the time to study, read, test and constantly improve. Be disciplined with your money. It\u2019s fucking hard to make, easy to lose. Protect that shit. \n\n\\--\n\nFor those of you this resonates with, you\u2019ll be fine long term. Do the fucking work. For those of you who love chasing the fantasy, good luck, I mean it. It\u2019s a tough fucking pill to swallow watching your account get dwindled down to zero. Nothing tastes worse that losing all your money. \n\nPeace.",

        "selftext": "All is in the title. It was 95% of my savings. Now I come here not to lament or anything, I have to deal with that shit on my own. My friends and wife (as of now...) have my trading account frozen anyway.\n\nI come here to remind that losing can have consequences and what got me is the infamous but very real \"I'm going to recoup my losses\". At first I lost on long plays, shares, i kid you not in March i sold fsly and net at respectively 24 and 18$, approx 160k down to 120 (I bought Fastly at 32 last year).\n\nThen I discovered options and bought monthly ATM 550c from TSLA and it visited the 400 pretty quick at that time. This got me another 40k deeper. I know today it's close to 3000 (600 post split)...\n\nI did some good lucky moves and mostly made it all back in the summer, but they i decided for whatever reason to bet on Intel because there was a a series of good chip manufacturer earnings... They did -20% the fuckers and that's when things started getting fun. I got margin called so I wired intraday more funds, they were immediately available and in my panic I discovered 0DTE.\n\n0DTE was the beginning of the downward spiral that transformed a 160k loss into a 410k loss, week after week, by chunks of 25k i kept wiring to reload my day trading limit. This is basically when you MUST find the strength to stop. I kept dreaming about more multipliers \"I can do x3, x5 or x10 with a good 1pm qqq buy that will end up with a hulk dildo by 4pm\". This my friends is typically the exact reason your brain will defeat all your rules, your checks and you might even start lying just because you think its possible to make it back.\n\nI've lost everything, I don't own any property, my parents are poor and not from the US, I'm actually homeless right now but I have a good paying job in a Bay Area company. The morale of the story is that it's all fun and games if you play and stick to a small % of your saving and ABSOLUTELY don't refund your account if you take losses, denial is a stronger force than you think, and addiction to day trades is very real. Anyhow, I will carry over my big loss for years while my wife is going to use my savings and buy regular SPY so we can at least offset the possible gains in 10-15 yrs...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't be the next me.",

        "selftext": "Earlier this year, Apple announced a new policy for their IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) which is basically your unique identifier so ad companies can impact you with ads. \n\nNow, instead of being shared by default, ad companies will need apps to implement permission requests that will ask the following question: \n\n\u201cExample App would like to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. \nButton 1-&gt; Allow Tracking\nButton 2-&gt;Ask App Not to Track\u201d\n(Sorry, I didn\u2019t manage to post a screenshot)\n\nEarly testing by different companies showed that Allow Tracking gets between 0% and 20% conversion rate. \n\nSo what happens with the rest of users? They don\u2019t share their identifier, and that is a massive deal. Ad companies (like Facebook) are completely blind and can\u2019t offer personalized ads based on behavior and can\u2019t attribute installs (meaning, Facebook doesn\u2019t know if it has provided you with an installation, so how is it going to charge you for the ad?). \n\nThe full scope of the implications excedes my knowledge (and I know a thing or two about this topic), but a whole bunch of technology, revenue models, advertising strategies and a long and unknown etcetera is going to be effectively useless for 58% of the US market in 2021. \n\nLearned a lot from this sub, so I thought it was fair to give you guys this clue.

That's ballsy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jw7zed/i_heard_were_doing_pltr_now_my_whole_account_aka/).\n\nNow I'm sure you're wondering: where the fuck is PLTR's ceiling? \n\n#PLTR's advantages, now with some data\n\nI'll admit, most of my previous DD was equal parts BS and equal parts cocaine fueled shitposting that had a semblance of logic and formatting. But this time, I have **facts** in addition to my cocaine fueled shitposting. \n\nRealistically, Palantir's biggest advantage is that it helps large companies streamline their own disparate datasets without needing the companies do anything *to* that data. \n\n**This means:** Palantir clients don't have to change the way they operate to gain additional insights.\n\nEssentially, a client would use Palantir's suite of tools like Gotham to parse through all of their data so that they can make better use of said data. This part from [their IR report](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx) gets quoted a lot, but it's worth looking at:\n\n&gt; An oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and **generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks** of starting to use our platform.\n&gt;\n&gt; The energy company **identified an additional $315 million in cost savings opportunities** using our software, and the company\u2019s management is currently **targeting $1 billion in total savings** in the coming year through the use of our platform. \n\nAgain, keep in mind that all of this is happening without the client changing their data - i.e. no need to hire a dedicated team to handle data migration (along with all the risks associated with that), and no need to train their existing team to learn a new method for data entry.\n\nEssentially: with minimal disruption to operations, this client is suddenly able to identify pathways for savings by using Palantir. \n\nThe best part? \n\nThis client can't *leave* Palantir because Palantir didn't *change* anything on the client's end. All Palantir did was give the client a tool that connects some dots between dataset A and dataset B that were previously unconnected. \n\nGet rid of Palantir, and that connection is lost: this is because dataset A and dataset B used to never talk to each other, and they'll probably still never talk to each other. All Palantir did was help the *humans* behind the wheel see the connection.\n\nThis means Palantir's non-government contracts are likely to be very sticky. Moreover, in instances of mergers and acquisitions, the marrying of data is usually a huge headache. If that headache can be reduced, then it smooths out potential friction in operations and allows new acquisitions to more quickly start performing and generating ROI for their new parent company.\n\n--------------\n\n#Palantir's Future\n\nPalantir has a very bright future ahead of it for the following reasons:\n\n- Large total addressable market\n- Clean balance sheet\n- Closer integration with the military\n\nPalantir's total addressable market is estimated at 119 billion dollars. For you retards who don't know what TAM means, I'll spell it out for you:\n\n&gt; Total Addressable Market is a term that is typically used to reference the revenue opportunity available for a product or service. \n\nBut keep in mind that just because TAM is high doesn't necessarily mean that will all translate into income. As competitors emerge, they will eat into that market. But until a competitor can find the 21st century Osama bin-Laden, or help the US military fight an informationized war (more on that later), I don't think they'll be able to hold a candle to Palantir's capabilities. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point: Palantir's balance sheet is sexy as fuck.\n\nDuring their most recent earning call, they revised their revenue guidance upward to 1.07 to 1.072 *billion* in 2020. Let that number sink in. This is a 2500-person company bringing in over a BILLION dollars per year in revenue in what will most likely be incredibly *sticky* revenue. \n\nBut retard, I can hear you say, you didn't see how much they lost. \n\nI did, you asshole. And I'm getting to it: \n\nPalantir's main losses came from employee stock compensation. Namely:\n\n&gt; The company reported a third-quarter net loss of $853.3 million, or 94 cents a share, compared with a loss of $144.1 million, or 24 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Its adjusted loss was $73 million, adjusted for $847 million in stock-based compensation. \n\nPersonally, I don't see this as a loss, because retaining strong human talents in this space will be crucial for Palantir's continued dominance in this particular space. The stock-based compensation accounts for 99.26% of its entire third quarter net loss. \n\nAgain, let that shit sink in. \n\nMeanwhile, Palantir *grew* its revenue: \n\n&gt; Palantir brought in revenue of $289 million, a 52% increase from revenue of $191 million in the third quarter last year.\n\nSo long as Palantir can keep its stock-based compensation at a steady value--and I have no reason to believe that they won't--then, their continued increase in revenue will eventually outpace any such loss in the future. \n\nBut most importantly, they have 1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30th. Sitting on a pile of cash gives them operational flexibility and can help pad any unexpected issues that might arise. \n\nWhich brings us to the final big point:\n\n--------------\n\n#Palantir and the Military\n\n[I'll just link the Q3 earnings presentation for you](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf) because it's got pretty pictures that you retards love. But here are the main points:\n\n- Palantir software is becoming the de facto operating system of US and Allied Defense\n- 2-year, $91M contract with US army research lab for AI and ML development\n- Enabling Mission Command for NORAD &amp; USNORTHCOM Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (N/NC JADC2)\n\n**Palantir software is becoming the de facto operating system of US and Allied Defense**\n\nWe're moving towards an era of even greater integration and interoperability in the military--not just between different branches but between different nation's militaries as well. One of the key factors that allowed the Allies to kick the shit out of Nazi Germany was a unified command structure. \n\nPalantir is building just that for the US and her allies. \n\nThink of how inefficient the military is, especially a military alliance that spans multiple nations, multiple languages, and multiple different command structures. \n\nThink of how *dumb* your average crayon-eating grunt is. You think Lance Corporal Fuckface is going to learn French or German or Polish so he can coordinate effectively with his counterpart in NATO and call in an airstrike? Or you think he'll just go through a simplified process of calling it in to the US chain of command, and that data gets relayed via Palantir's services to the appropriate French jet on station to deliver some ordnance? \n\n**US Army Research Lab Implication**\n\n[This is the kind of shit](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-can-help-hunt-down-missile-sites-in-china/) that the US army uses AI and ML for:\n\n- Identifying Chinese and Russian airbases, missile sites, and radars\n- Significantly cut down on the amount of time a human has to sift through satellite images\n\nThis forms the informational logistical backbone in the era of informational warfare. Here is the example image from the slideshow where Palantir is used to [identify an airbase in the Russian Far East](https://i.imgur.com/X2irHFV.png), identifying crucial equipment and logistical nodes that can be prioritized in a war. \n\n**N/NC JADC2 Implications**\n\nPalantir outright states that they're using AI to help provide course of action development to NORAD. It means we're one step closer to Skynet, baby! But more importantly, Palantir placed what looks to be an image of a [SIGINT/ELINT op](https://i.imgur.com/tiqwNu6.png) off the coast of Kamchatka. \n\nBut that's not what you should focus on. You should focus on the fact that Palantir is now a crucial part of mission command in NORAD operations. Y'all remember Desert Storm? How the US Air Force basically clowned on Saddam's army for a month straight? That shit didn't emerge in a vacuum. It took 9 months of non-stop mission planning and 24/7 command and control during the op. \n\nPalantir's mission is to make the planning and command process of a similar op in the future *far more streamlined*. And given that China has more or less set a deadline for the reunification of Taiwan in 2049, the US needs to gear up for a major war in the Pacific while keeping an eye on Russia to make sure they don't try and rebuild the Soviet Union. \n\nAnd guess who will be passing all those delicious bits of data back and forth that entire time? \n\nPalantir.\n\n--------\n\nEDIT: All you assholes telling me I jinxed it, consider this your chance to buy shares on the cheap. \n\nAll you retards buying FD's, just switch to ITM LEAPs.",

I have 10% of my liquid portfolio invested it.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is nearing record highs after more than doubling this year, partly driven by fears that major central bank easing and fiscal stimulus will debase currencies. The digital asset [advanced](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/bitcoin-tops-17-000-for-first-time-since-december-2017) for a third session Wednesday, outperforming most of its rivals to break above $18,000. Its performance has attracted some big Wall Street money managers including Fidelity Investments, which launched a Bitcoin fund over the summer, and macro investor [Paul Tudor Jones](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1704916).\n\nIn a series of tweets Tuesday, hedge fund founder [Ray Dalio](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1801626) questioned the cryptocurrency\u2019s utility as a storehold of wealth, but [added](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/ray-dalio-says-he-might-be-missing-something-about-bitcoin): \u201cI might be missing something about Bitcoin, so I\u2019d love to be corrected.\u201d\n\nOther wealthy Bitcoin backers include Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins who are [now](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-06/winklevoss-twins-ride-bitcoin-surge-to-become-billionaires-again) worth about $1 billion each from the cryptocurrency\u2019s surge, according to Bloomberg\u2019s wealth index.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s gains have helped make up for Salinas\u2019s business interests. Shares in his biggest listed asset -- conglomerate [Grupo Elektra SAB](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ELEKTRA%2A:MM) \\-- have slumped more than 10% this year, while those in the local [television network](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AZTECACP:MM) he and his family control have dropped almost 60%.\n\nA spokesman for Salinas didn\u2019t immediately reply to an email and phone call seeking comment.\n\nSalinas, 65, who contracted Covid-19 last month, [said](https://twitter.com/RicardoBSalinas/status/1328895703486255104) in a later tweet he first invested in Bitcoin four years ago, adding he holds the balance of his liquid portfolio in precious metals miners. Salinas and his family have earned more than $500 million through dividends from their listed holdings in the past two decades, according to the Bloomberg\u2019s wealth index.\n\nSalinas has also used Twitter to comment on the pandemic. He previously called for Mexico\u2019s health officials to stop imposing \u201c[authoritarian](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-15/mexican-billionaire-says-health-officials-are-wrecking-economy)\u201d policies to contain the spread of virus and took to the site again to reveal his own diagnosis.\n\n\u201cTake care of yourselves and do not be afraid,\u201d he [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/mexican-billionaire-with-covid-says-we-ll-all-get-it-eventually) last month. \u201cWe\u2019ll all have to get it, and we will be fine.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Gather round my fellow gamblers and shit posters, I have a story and a proposition for you all.\n\nSeveral weeks ago **I had the bright idea to YOLO my entire account in Palantir**. \n\nWhen PLTR was down and out, myself and a few otherwise guys were balls to the wall in long positions. We all loved the company, but quite frankly, things were looking pretty bleak. While we knew the company should be worth more than the measly $9 it was at, the market price told us otherwise.\n\nI was rather worried about what I had done. YOLOing my entire account into Palantir on IPO day drove me to post **a sad story about I had fucked up thousands and thousands of dollars of gains**, which I later deleted out of embarrassment. You can find the remnants of that story here:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3xaua/once\\_upon\\_a\\_time\\_in\\_2020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3xaua/once_upon_a_time_in_2020/)\n\nThe only thing that remains is some top comments of people calling me a retarded degenerate.\n\nI held on to my sweet sweet palantir, and as any good redditor would, I continued preaching the gospel of Thiel and Karp in any case.\n\nin one WSB conversation, I was lamenting about how I needed money from Palantir in order to pay for the PS5 I had already pre-ordered. This was a very serious concern, because I had paid Walmart, and subsequently saw my Palantir position lose several thousand dollars. Wasn't quite sure how I would explain this one to the Mrs.\n\nA classic millennial problem indeed.\n\nThen along came a random internet stranger named u/ZanderPerk. He promised me that he **would buy me a PS5 if PLTR hit $20 by end of the year**, which at the time, seemed like an outlandish price. You can find that comment here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj8apo/last\\_chance\\_for\\_early\\_bird\\_pricing\\_pltr/gagx94u/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jj8apo/last_chance_for_early_bird_pricing_pltr/gagx94u/?context=3)\n\nA few weeks later, our sweet sweet hivemind started heating up, and I reminded the internet of what was promised:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jpbtx9/pltr\\_looking\\_forward\\_to\\_my\\_free\\_ps5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jpbtx9/pltr_looking_forward_to_my_free_ps5/)\n\nZanderperk, being the gentleman that he is, assured me that **he would live up to his end of the bargain**: [https://i.imgur.com/8lM0j4D.png](https://i.imgur.com/8lM0j4D.png)\n\nSo in anticipation of this glorious transaction, I did what anyone in my position would, and ordered a custom bumper sticker in Zander's honour: [https://i.imgur.com/4d2yhA2.png](https://i.imgur.com/4d2yhA2.png)\n\nThis baby will be slapped right on top the console, and forever live beside my 55 inch 4k TV.\n\nNow it seems that reddit has caught wind of this tale, and people are calling on Zander to send me the money. I have asked him for his email address so that I can send him a PayPal money request, to the tune of $499 USD. You can see further discussion here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzjzlg/pltr\\_just\\_won\\_this\\_man\\_a\\_playstation\\_5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzjzlg/pltr_just_won_this_man_a_playstation_5/)\n\n# Now here is my promise to pay it forward.\n\n# Since PLTR has indeed hit $20 before the end of the year, I will do the exact same thing for someone else *IF* Zander pays up AND it hits $30 before the end of the year.\n\nIf Zander sends me the money, I will post pictures of the PS5 and sticker in WSB for you all to see, and I will update this post with a link to that post. (The sticker doesn't arrive until \\~Dec 7th.)\n\n***Then*** if PLTR crosses $30.00 before the end of Dec 31 2021, I will set up a quick lottery system to give out another PS5 using some clever technology that will be determined at a later date. (I already have an idea in mind.)\n\nIn order to enter the draw, people must be able to prove that they are still in an active stock holding or long option position. The position must be started or purchased before the end of the day tomorrow (November 24th). Bears can fuck off.\n\nThe winner will be ordered a PS5 disc edition off of Amazon, Walmart or Bestbuy straight to an address of their choice. Winner must reside in a country that receives deliveries from one of these stores.\n\n*CHECK BACK HERE FOR UPDATES.*",

I realize this is going to be outside the wheelhouse of the short attention span of most WSB players. But I think this is also a long-term lock for big gains with little risk and these asymmetric risks are ideal for long term candidates. \n\nUnum (UNM) is a Fortune 500 insurance company based in Chattanooga, TN. They primarily sell group disability and life insurance to other companies in the US and UK. 182k businesses get insurance through UNM \u2013 including one in three Fortune 500 companies. They also offer other insurance policies like accident, critical illness, dental, and vision (and historically offered Long Term Care Insurance). \n\nBelow is a historical financial summary (numbers from SA):\n\n$ in millions | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | TTM\n:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\nRevenues | 10,731.3 | 11,046.5 | 11,286.8 | 11,598.5 | 11,998.9 | 11,923.2 \nEBITDA | 1,490.6 | 1,615.4 | 1,667.3 | 896.5 | 1,696.9 | \t1,521.1\nBasic EPS | $3.51 | $3.96 | $4.39 | $2.38 | $5.25 | $4.67\n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\n1. Strong revenue and earnings even during COVID \u2013 for the third quarter of 2020, UNM reported net income of $231.1 million ($1.13 per share), compared to net income of $242.0 million ($1.16 per share) for the third quarter of 2019. COVID had a give and take impact on the business \u2013 they collect less premiums when employment goes down but COVID also lead to lower claims in some lines of business like their dental and vision insurance as people put off care. There was elevated mortality which lead to higher claims on their life insurance business. But overall, their earnings have seen little impact from COVID while their share price has been completely hammered. \n\n2. Valuation \u2013 this stock is insanely cheap. In February 2020 (immediately pre-COVID), the stock was trading close to $30.  Current PE ratio (TTM) is 4.47. Per the third quarter results, book value per common share is now up to $53.50 (14.6 percent growth compared to the year-ago quarter). It is trading at less than 50% of book value. \n\n3. Dividend Yield \u2013 current dividend is $1.14 per share (5.45% dividend yield). The dividend has been growing for the last 12 years. The 10 year dividend CAGR is 13.22%. Current payout ratio is under 23% so the dividend is about as safe as it gets.  \n\n4. Share buy-backs \u2013 in the past, the Board has authorized massive share repurchases. In May 2019, they authorized $750m of share repurchases. In 2019, they repurchased 12.3 million shares for $400.4 million. This was suspended during COVID, but it shows an appetite for buying back shares and that management thought the company was undervalued even in May 2019 when it was trading at $36 per share. \n\n5. Technicals \u2013 the stock is currently trading near historic support areas with limited downside, significant support, and lots of room for upside.\n \n**Headwinds**\n\nInvestors have primarily criticized UNM for the increases to reserves in the closed block Long Term Care (LTC) business. I think the market is putting too much emphasis on this business \u2013 and as morbid as it sounds, COVID is actually helping the Company here. \n\nIn the past, UNM tried to make a profit on LTC insurance and failed like many other insurers. They made bad assumptions on lapse rates and longevity which has cost them a lot of money \u2013 these policies are incredibly unprofitable now that people survive a long time in assisted living facilities and nursing homes. In 2009 they closed the individual LTC business and in 2012 they closed the group business. Even though the block has been closed, they have repeatedly dumped more money to increase their reserves. Earlier this year, the Company came to an agreement with insurance regulators in Maine to add $2.1b in reserves over the next 7 years. \nHowever, COVID seems to have had a favorable impact on the closed-block business (though they won\u2019t explicitly say this on earnings calls). A lot of the COVID deaths have happened in nursing homes which have led to increased mortality and therefore lower benefit payments. You can see this in their third quarter results: \n\n&gt;As reported in the third quarter results, the Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $70.8 million in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 163.2 percent from $26.9 million in the third quarter of 2019. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business was 67.4 percent in the third quarter of 2020, compared to an interest adjusted loss ratio of 89.8 percent in the third quarter of 2019, driven primarily by higher claimant mortality.\n\nEDIT: Imgur link with position proof\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XKfi9v1",

        "selftext": "Just wanted to put my thoughts out there before markets open for what it's worth.  Full disclosure, I do own PLTR along with EV stocks outside of TSLA.  They are currently only make up less than 10% of my portfolio.\n\nThe rally that we have seen this week has been impressive.  I imagine for traders this was an incredible week and a lot of money was made.  Hats off to you guys and cheers.  I've learned that there are many ways to win on the market, and trading is certainly one of them.  I'm not one to say that it's a horrible way to approach the markets just because it doesn't work or sit well with me.  For those who are interested in TRADING, this may not apply as much to you.\n\nHowever, for those who are thinking about INVESTING.  Please tread carefully.  Ask yourself these questions\n\n1. Do you know what the company does / is hoping to achieve?\n2. How does that sit with you?  Do you agree with the company's goals? \n3. What, if anything, would change your decision?  What are factors that you believe will prevent the company from doing what it intends to do?\n4. Given that you have a sense of the company's achievements, goals, and plans for the future, are you okay with paying what it's currently worth?\n\nAt least take some time to answer some of these questions before moving forward.  Similarly come up with a plan for investing your money.  Establish how much you intend to put in the company (i.e. 300 dollars).  If you are concerned that you are buying, for example, PLTR at its all time highs and that it will dip next week, start a position 1/3th position today and come up with a plan to invest the other 2/3 over the next two weeks.  That way if it does dip, you catch some of the dip, but if it does continue to go up for two more weeks, you at least caught some of the initial price/gain.  Either way, at least, by starting a 1/3rd position you can satisfy your FOMO and adjust your plan accordingly from there.\n\nAt the end of the day, tread carefully.  Take as much emotion out of the equation as possible.  Trust me, there will always be more opportunities to make money in the markets.  Right now it's PLTR.  A few days ago it was everything EV, few months ago it was all BioTech, a few months before that it was chip stocks.",

        "selftext": "December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.\n\nThey're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.\n\nHere are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Affirm\n\nSymbol: AFRM  \nFiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  \nRevenue growth: 93%  \nGross margin: n/a  \nNet loss: $113 million\n\n[Affirm\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)\n\nFounded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm\u2019s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.\n\n**Pros**: Affirm says its \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.\u00a0 As e-commerce grows, there\u2019s plenty of room for growth in the market\u2014less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers\u2019 ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.\n\n**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm\u2019s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.\n\n## Airbnb\n\nSymbol: ABNB  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  \nRevenue growth: -32%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $697 million\n\n[Airbnb\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)\n\nAs the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.\n\n**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb\u2019s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it\u2019s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.\n\n## DoorDash\n\nSymbol: DASH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  \nRevenue growth: 226%  \nGross margin: 53%  \nNet loss: $149 million\n\n[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)\n\nAfter moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash \u201cdashers\u201d deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.\n\n**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square\u2019s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.\n\n**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash\u2019s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash\u2019s business model.\n\n## Roblox\n\nSymbol: RBLX  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  \nRevenue growth: 68%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $206 million\n\n[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)\n\nMuch more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).\n\n**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans\u2019 app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.\n\n## Wish (ContextLogic)\n\nSymbol: WISH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  \nRevenue growth: 32%  \nGross margin: 65%  \nNet loss: $176 million\n\n[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)\n\nOvershadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the \u201caffordable\u201d segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.\n\n**Pros**: Shopping online isn\u2019t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish\u2019s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\n**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish\u2019s business with new rules or requirements.\n\n[Source](https://fortune.com/2020/11/25/2020-ipos-airbnb-roblox-affirm-wish-doordash-predictions-going-public/)",

        "selftext": "Some of the hottest private consumer tech companies are rushing to file their IPO prospectuses so they can go public before the end of the year.\n\nAirbnb, DoorDash, Roblox and Wish are all expected to make their filings public by early next week, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nIt\u2019s already been a big year for tech IPOs, most notably in September, which was the busiest year on record for the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nBetween early and mid-December, public investors will likely get their first crack at buying stock in food delivery provider DoorDash, e-retailer Wish and kids gaming company Roblox, according to people familiar with the matter. Airbnb is also expected to file its prospectus by early next week, putting the home-sharing company in position to hold its market debut after Thanksgiving, said two of the people.\n\nFilings are expected by next week, though the timing could change based on market conditions, said the people, who asked not to be named because their plans are private.\n\nAll four companies confidentially filed paperwork with the SEC this year, setting the stage for eventual public offerings. DoorDash announced its submission in February, followed by Airbnb and Wish in August and Roblox in October. Because the virtual roadshow has become commonplace during Covid, companies only need a couple weeks to meet with investors before their debuts.\n\nRepresentatives from each of the companies declined to comment for this story.\n\nDespite an economic crisis, tech IPOs are red hot, reflecting a sector that has outperformed the market in the face of a global pandemic, which has killed over 240,000 Americans, while investors also navigated the uncertainty of a presidential election. Stocks rallied after Joe Biden\u2019s electoral defeat of President Donald Trump, giving tech companies that were surveying the market further incentive to go out now, said Kelly Rodriques, CEO of pre-IPO marketplace Forge.\n\nThe sector\u2019s strong performance has persuaded all four companies to push forward with going public now, before conditions change. About a dozen other global tech companies could raise at least $1 billion in an offering that are preparing for 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/airbnb-doordash-wish-roblox-ipos-all-expected-before-year-end.html)",

        "selftext": "I've been trading stocks for \\~15 years and options for \\~10. I have a full-time job and just do this on the side, but I've seen and tried a lot of stuff. \n\nOne of my favorite trading strategies involves selling SPX put credit spreads around 9-10 delta (2-5% OTM), 2 days to expiration. Crazy, right? Yeah, sounds like it. But bear with me while I lay out the nitty-gritty. I like the strategy so much that I've decided to (finally) lay it out in full detail for others to learn.\n\nMy inspiration for this started after reading and following Karsten's \"Passive income through option writing\" from [EarlyRetirementNow.com](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/09/28/passive-income-through-option-writing-part1/). He lays out his reasoning and thought process way better than I ever could, so if you like what you see here, go check out his stuff as well for more research and a twist on what I'm doing.\n\n**What I Do**\n\nEvery Monday, Wednesday, &amp; Friday, I sell (open) new put credit spreads on SPX that expire at the closest expiration. So, Monday, I sell SPX spreads that expire Wednesday. Wednesday, I sell spreads that expire Friday. Friday, I sell spreads that expire Monday. I hold these all the way to expiration and then open a new position with the next expiration. 95% of the time, these expire worthless and I collect full premium. The other 5% of the time, I suffer a small or large loss. Over the long run, the expected return blows the market out of the water....which leads me to:\n\n**Expected Return**\n\nI've been running this since May 2019 and am averaging something around **150% APY** based on max risk for the spread. It's absurd. \n\n**Risk &amp; Drawdown**\n\nThis massive positive return doesn't come at a cost, of course. And if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. And the cost here is that, yeah, while annual return is a ridiculous 150%, max drawdown can be 100% or more. ***Whaaaaat?!*** Yeah, that's right. While these spreads expire worthless 95% of the time, the other 5% can result in huge losses. These losses can accumulate up to 100% or more depending on the environment. \n\nSo this is a guaranteed way to blow up your account, right? Well, it is if you allocate too much capital to it. But if you keep your allocation small (which I do), then a 100%+ drawdown for this one strategy will be a small fraction of your overall portfolio. I personally only allocate about 10% of my total portfolio to this. What that means is that if/when this trading plan suffers a 100% loss, that only represents 10% drawdown for my portfolio, and I can tap into my other investments to \"replenish\" this trading plan.\n\nThese massive losses do happen, but they don't last long. I ran this very strategy through COVID-19 when VIX moved from 13 to 85 in a month, and my max drawdown was \"only\" about 125%. I reloaded from my other investments, and this put selling strategy recovered and turned green in 2020 before the market itself did...after I went down 125%.\n\n**Pennies, Meet Steamroller, Right?**\n\nYeah, this is pretty close to the definition of picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. There's nothing inherently wrong with that IF:\n\n1. The pennies that you collect add up to more than what the steamroller takes away\n2. You limit allocation so that when the steamroller hits you, it doesn't destroy you\n\n\\#1 - I collect around 2.3% premium per position compared to max risk (spread width). 95% of the time, they expire worthless, so I keep the full 2.3%. The other 5% of the time, I suffer what is usually a large loss, averaging around 20%. Do the math here: 95 \\* 2.3 is 220% gain on the wins. 5 \\* 20% is 100% loss on the losers. 220% - 100% makes for a very positive expected return...So that takes care of #1. The pennies I collect far outweigh the steamroller when it hits me.\n\n\\#2 - I only allocate 10% of my overall portfolio to this. When the steamroller hits me and results in a 100% loss for the strategy, I'm not wiped out. That's only 10% drawdown on my account, which is easy to recover from. This is what so many people miss when talking about the ole steamroller. If you just keep allocation in check, it's *okay* to get hit by a steamroller every now and then.\n\n**Trade Process - Timing &amp; Strike Selection**\n\nThe process here is simple. Every M/W/F afternoon, open a new set of put spreads expiring at the next expiration. Monday's position expires Wednesday. Wednesday's position expires Friday. Friday's position expires Monday. My short strike is around 9-10 delta. My long strike is 100-150 points below that. This results in a short strike around 2% OTM in low IV environments and 5% OTM in high IV environments. The long strike will be 5-10% OTM, again depending on IV. It'll be farther out as VIX rises. \n\nYou only suffer max loss if the S&amp;P500 drops 5% in a day or two out of absolutely nowhere (VIX &lt; 15), or if S&amp;P500 drops 10% in a day or two ***after*** freefall has already started. In 18 months, and with VIX rocketing to 85 during that timeframe, not once has one of my spreads even seen max loss....I'm sure it'll happen at some point, but if didn't happen in 2020, I'm curious to see when it would happen.\n\n**Why SPX**\n\n* 3 expirations available every week (Monday/Wednesday/Friday)\n* Highly liquid\n* Cash-settled. No underlying given to me on assignment.\n* Low trading fees (for me personally - your mileage may vary)\n* Beneficial tax treatment (60/40% long-term based on IRS 1256 contract straddles)\n* Less \"paperwork\" to file for taxes. Futures and index options aggregate together on IRS tax forms, eliminating 200 line items from this trading strategy in a year\n\nSPX is awesome.\n\n**Alternatives to SPX**\n\nSome of you may not have access to SPX options. Or your account isn't large enough to be handle SPX options. They are huge. A single contract represents $300k notional. The cash-settlement and risk-defined trades help diminish the impact of size, but it's still a lot of underlying to carry around. /ES (futures) are half the size and should work as well (just be sure you understand fees, assignment, and liquidity first). SPY can also work and is even smaller than /ES. Again, understand assignment of shares and fees. You also lose the tax benefit with SPY. But on smaller accounts, this may be the only viable option.\n\n**More Reading + Full Trade Log and Performance History**\n\nI set up a website dedicated to just this one strategy. It's not an interactive website or anything. I'm not selling anything or pushing a service/newsletter. It's just a place where I can define the strategy in way more detail than I've done here, and also a place where I can maintain a current and updated log of all of my trades and performance history. To learn more about the strategy and see actual trades/performance, check out the website: \n\n[https://wealthyoption.com](https://wealthyoption.com/)\n\nI am ***not*** selling or advertising anything on that site, whether my own stuff or somebody else's. Yes, there's a donate page up there, but that's not why I created the site and not why I posted this. But if you find this, love it, and want to return the favor, there's at least that option.\n\n**Questions / Suggestions**\n\nIf you're interested in this but have questions/concerns, fire away. I like to teach people, and I'm here to help.\n\nOr, if you're a pro or tried something like this before and see or know something that I'm missing, let me know that as well. Try to blast holes in my trading plan! I feel good enough about it now to finally share with the masses....but if there are any glaring holes or flaws, I want to know what those are.\n\n**Hope you enjoyed reading!!**",

        "selftext": "# PLTR OVER $30 USD IN EUROPE. FREE TOYS AT THE BOTTOM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWelp my friends. Like 2 days ago I said if Palantir made it to $30 by the end of the year, I\u2019d give out a PS5 to someone in this subreddit.\n\nWhile a 50% gain over 6 weeks sounded aggressive, turns out things are moving a tad faster around here.\n\nLooks like we are over $30 in Europe. Fuck it. Let\u2019s do this draw now. It\u2019s American Thanksgiving after all.\n\n\\--\n\nBut before I live up to my promise and get into the details of how you enter this draw, I think I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t use this opportunity to get my thoughts in about Palantir.\n\n**First and foremost, will everyone who is calling PLTR a quote \u201cmeme stock\u201d shut the hell up?**\n\nJust because a bunch of gorilla IQ memers happen to be buying something, does not mean that the thing they are buying is stupid. All those dingleberries also own Androids and iPhones, does that doesn\u2019t mean Google and Apple are \u201cmeme companies\u201d? No.\n\nUnlike actual meme stocks such as: unprofitable weed companies, camera companies gone pharma, car rental companies gone bankrupt, and little airlines living off corporate welfare - Palantir is actually a ROCK SOLID COMPANY with an extremely promising future.\n\nThis rally was predictable and **it will keep on going in the long run.**\n\nMyself and many others in WSB, r/investing and r/stocks got in on day one - not out of chance - but because we did our due diligence and we could see the writing on the wall: Palantir has the potential to possibly become one of the most important tech companies in the world, and it is being led by people with a track record to back it up.\n\nThis stock isn\u2019t mooning because we have posted 10,000 memes and shit posts. I'm sorry kiddos and Cramer, but our TikTok videos with a few thousand views aren't powerful enough to create $25B of stock market value.\n\nThere is something much larger at play here, and we in WSB are lucky enough to be along for the ride.\n\nPLTR is heading to Mars because the financial institutions didn\u2019t have the opportunity to get in before the IPO and now they are racing to catch up. Moreover, now that **Palantir\u2019s first quarterly report has proven they are the real deal,** and everyone has started googling this pandora\u2019s box of a company - the market is going \u201choly shit\u201d.\n\nThe only question mark that was in Palantir\u2019s path was the impact Joe Biden\u2019s administration might have on the company's relationship with the US government.\n\nWith a former Palantir consultant Avril Haines at the helm of the entire US intelligence community as of this week, the risk of the new administration working against Palantir has been all but removed.\n\nThat\u2019s why we are up bigly this week.\n\nBut more importantly, **you need to consider the global technological context of this company, to truly understand its future potential.**\n\n1. In the 90\u2019s PC\u2019s took over. \n2. In the 2000\u2019s it was all about the .coms.\n3. The 2010\u2019s was the era of wireless and mobile platforms.\n4. 2020 WILL be the decade of smart automation through a global wifi network.\n\nAnd because of that, there is now an information and technology cold war brewing. China and USA are racing to get control of the global internet infrastructure, and they are doing everything they can to invent true AI. \n\nOnce the entire world and everything in your home goes \u201csmart\u201d and becomes connected to Starlink\u2019s grid, someone or some*thing* is going to need to sift through the quintillions of zeroes and ones, to make sense of it all in real time. Guess who is **the only company in the world that has the know-how and business/political connections to fill that void?**\n\nAt the risk of getting too deep in the weeds here, I need to mention one last detail: You all need to read up on Project Maven.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Project Maven is an AI drone project that Google was originally supposed to fulfill for the US Airforce. Google walked from the contract citing \"ethical\" concerns, and then Palantir picked up the pieces. Imagine how pissed the US Airforce was when Google called them unethical and embarrassed them?\n\nThis has a **very** important underlying implication. If you accept the premise that the American government is going ham in this technological revolution, there still remains the question as to who will be the primary benefactor. \n\nCommon sense would suggest that companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft will be working with the US government to create AI. However, Project Maven changed all that. \n\nGoogle's refusal to fulfill their top secret contract taught the government that they cannot trust the trillion dollar megacaps to be unequivocally and unapologetically pro-USA. Those companies are so big, that they don't need to choose a side in geopolitics, and they will almost certainly continue to offer their products to everyone around the world. \n\nWhen it comes to matters of national cybersecurity, the odds are that **the US government is going to put all it's eggs in a company that is unquestionably loyal and patriotic.** When the pentagon is creating a trillion dollar AI behemoth, they know they need to work with someone they can trust when push comes to shove. Palantir is the only AI company that is bold enough to do so, and **their founders have created a special the corporate share structure to ensure they will never lose control**.\n\nSo again, this is not a fucking \"meme stock\".\n\nPLTR is mooning like your pubescent boner on viagra because everyone is starting to realize that this **magnificent titan the CIA created** (*see In-Q-Tel*) has gone public and will probably be at the forefront of the next global technological revolution.\n\nSo: \n\n* Stop worrying about a dip next week. (*Yes it might happen. So what?*)\n* Stop worrying about a price crash post lock up. (*This will happen. But from what price to what price? Who cares?*)\n* Stop trying to time the market to squeeze out an extra $1000. (*We aren\u2019t smart enough or fast enough to win that game.*)\n* Stop viewing Palantir like it\u2019s a penny stock. It\u2019s not.\n\n**Start** looking at the year 2030 and imagine what you will do with your money then, if you grow the man balls (or lady balls) required to hold that long.\n\nHow you handle your positions over the next 6-12 months may be the most important decision of your life: do... not... sell\u2026\n\nThere are only a handful of times in your life when a person should truly go all in. 1) When you meet the person you know you want to marry. When you decide to change your career. And when a company like Palantir goes public.\n\nIn 10 years, you can thank me. Today, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nGod speed.\n\n\\--\n\nNow for the fun stuff.\n\n# RULES:\n\n* You must be 18 or older to enter.\n* You must be in a country where you are able to receive shipments from Walmart, Amazon, Bestbuy and/or Gamestop.\n* Your reddit account must be at least 1 week old to claim the prize.\n* There are no financial or trading requirements for this draw.

        "selftext": "  \n\nAlright guys, so a couple of days ago I took one too many Adderall and in order to burn through the high, I went through Roblox\u2019s financial statements in depth. And let me tell you, the numbers I found in there, literally makes my bull cock hard. Let me show you why in this post.  \n\nFor this analysis I will first start off with a general intro into Roblox; more specifically, I will talk about what it is, what it does, and how it makes its revenue. Then I will examine the micro factors by looking at the company\u2019s financial statements and identify any notable patterns and items of interest that can affect future profitability. Let\u2019s begin. \n\nWhat Is Roblox And Where Does Its Money Come From\n\nRoblox started off in 2004 as a platform for human co-experience which is done in user-generated 3D digital worlds that the company considers to be the \u201cnew form of social interaction\u201d (*This part is key, social interaction, it is what sets Roblox apart from a lot of these gaming and social media companies that I will get to later on)*. From there, growth at the company is driven primarily from investment in technology and two mutually reinforcing network effects: content and social. This means that the more high-quality content the users create, the more additional users are attracted to the platform, and the cycle repeats. While this is going on, the company profits off of this through two main revenue streams: the sale of its virtual currency Robux *(Its primary source of revenue)*, and subscription to Roblox Premium. Both of these I will get into later on. \n\nPutting all of this together means the company is **NOT** a gaming company like EA, nor is it purely a social media or user-generated content company like Facebook or YouTube; rather, the company is a mix of all three. I say this because unlike a traditional gaming company like EA who spends millions each year developing a new game that may or may not turn into shit with their fanbase *(every A.C game after Ezio)*, Roblox just sits back, relax, and let their own content creators do the heavy lifting by creating games on their platform which draws in the users, which in turn purchases the microtransactions on Robux and subscribes to Roblox Premium. \n\nNow, the reason why I say Roblox is similar in some sense to Facebook and YouTube is that on Roblox you to can create friends and social groups with people you meet in real life and on their virtual world. There you can exchange ideas, build worlds together, or just play games and chat to each other. Much like a Facebook account, some people log on to Roblox purely to chat with their friends for extended periods of time. Now in terms of YouTube, the biggest similarity Roblox has with the content creating company is that Roblox\u2019s content creators are **PAID** **and paid well.** In 2020, its content creators are estimated to make $250m, that\u2019s more than double the $110m they made in 2019 (*The money Roblox pays to its content creators are called Developer Exchange Fees on their S-1*). The creators earn money whenever a user spends their virtual currency in one of their games **and** how much time premium users spend in their games. For some of their games, Roblox will share as much as 70% of the proceeds with the content creators [(https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/28/roblox-expects-to-pay-250-million-to-its-mostly-teen-developers-this-year/#:\\~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20Roblox's%20developers%20are,of%20Premium%20subscribers%20in%2Dgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/(https:/venturebeat.com/2020/07/28/roblox-expects-to-pay-250-million-to-its-mostly-teen-developers-this-year/%23:~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20Roblox's%20developers%20are,of%20Premium%20subscribers%20in-game)). So unlike YouTube, where they try to penny pinch anyway they can, Roblox actually recognizes that their content creators are the key to their growth strategy and will make sure that they are well compensated in order to sustain their growth engine and judging on the fact that their daily active user (DAU) growth is a whopping **96.86%** YoY based on their Q3 figures, it\u2019s probably a winning strategy (*page 107 of S-1*). \n\nLastly, it is also important to note that a lot of the growth in DAU and bookings is driven by the pandemic lockdowns, but a look into the company\u2019s operating metrics will show that the company has enjoyed significant growth in users, hours engaged, and bookings well before the pandemic, which means that the company should be able to continuously grow at a significant pace even post covid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hq6r394ysf161.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d58768665b55dcd618de9cffec49bbc8b7c702be\n\n  \n\n**TL;DR** Any analyst saying Roblox is a \u2018gaming\u2019 company is the equivalent of them saying Tesla is just another \u2018automobile\u2019 company and giving it a $200PT ([Roblox S-1 IPO filing released - cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/roblox-s-1-ipo-filing-released.html)). They\u2019re retarded and so are you if you\u2019re listening to them. Roblox is a mix of a gaming and social media company with explosive growth in DAU.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  **The Financials**\n\n***Balance Sheet***\n\nLooked at the statement and its absolutely fucking solid. Here is a snapshot so you know I\u2019m not pulling this out of my ass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwqw0i74tf161.png?width=943&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcfbd4c78af77777b555a046d08ff922f2979ad4\n\n  \n\nAs you can see, both current(1,212,259) and total assets(1,489,541) are greater than their current(904,302) and total liabilities(1,436,664). This means this company is both liquid and solvent so it is strong on a balance sheet perspective. One liability I want to focus on however is their deferred revenue, which is by far the largest liability the company has on their balance sheet. For all you non-accountants out there, deferred revenue is unearned revenue, meaning they received payment for a service that they have yet to provide. For Roblox, that service refers to the perks that come from the purchases of Robux or subscription to Roblox Premium. The company also refers to the purchase of Robux as bookings and will accrue these liabilities and the revenue generated from them over the average lifetime of a paying user which is 23 months(*page 23 of S-1*). This means that this liability will not result in future cash outflow, which means the company will be less restricted in investing more into itself or continue to pay its content creators. \n\n**TL;DR**: Company is solid based on balance sheet fundamentals. Their largest liability is their unearned/deferred revenue which isn\u2019t going to create a cash outflow that will impact future investments. \n\n  \n\n**Income Statement**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mphvkz9ctf161.png?width=895&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c416e32fc628b5f29e58091be1e993c7ce0bf13\n\n  \n\nThe first thing you are going to notice is the explosive revenue growth of 68% (588,675 / 349,888) which shows that the company is doing really well during the pandemic. In addition, the company is able to keep its core operating expenses growth stable to its revenue growth while keeping its other expenses such as G&amp;A and Sales/Marketing to a bare minimum. This shows that the management of Roblox knows how to run a tight ship. In addition, it can be argued that a lot of these expenses are really an investment into the company\u2019s own future, such as paying content creators (Developer exchange fees), investing in infrastructure, and research and development. Honestly, I would prefer the company to run up losses on these expenses early on in order to help scale its growth than to have them do it later on. \n\n**TL;DR:** Revenue growth is high for years and the majority of expenses are attributed to the company investing those proceeds into the business and its operations which in turn will help fuel future growth. \n\n   **Conclusion**\n\nThis is a truly unique company that combines all the best characteristics of the gaming, social media, and content creation industries. The company has solid fundamentals, strong revenue, and user growth, and will most likely significantly scale their business upwards for the foreseeable future.  Even though this company is most likely going to turn into a WSB meme, the fundamentals themselves support large price appreciation in the stock. \n\nGet in retards. \n\nI plan to buy stocks when they IPO, and switch half my holdings into leap calls when options become available.",

        "selftext": "I've been seeing a lot of comparisons between GME now and the VW short squeeze back in 2008. For those of you who've been living under a rock, GME's short is currently more the entire number of outstanding shares. This is a very interesting, but the more important fact is that the number of shares sold short is roughly 3x the entire float. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udkkxz9ok1261.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f98f9645d9e2bf94dc3ccbd409f2d2b375be6d91\n\nThis is very important, as to cover short positions, MM's will have to buy from the float, the greater the Short % of Float, the greater the squeeze. In comparison, VW had a short float of just under 13% right before the insane short squeeze. Now, roughly 30-35% of VW shares were in the float, with Porsche holding 42.6%, the state of Lower Saxony holding 20%, and about 5-6% held by passive investors. This made the Short % of Float about 40%, far less than GME currently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe short squeeze occurred because Porsche announced that they were going to exercise options to buy another 31.5% of the float, taking their total up to 74.1%, and had plans to hold 75% of VW the following year. This triggered a squeeze as shorts rushed to buy to cover before Porsche exercised the options. As you can see from the graph, VW's share price jumped nearly 5x, and then quickly fell back down. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8720v4xm1261.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116f1045eacf3e73ecde3e44868b0867ca0b1231\n\nA GME short squeeze will likely do the same thing, with possibly an even greater climb. However, this is no sure thing. To trigger the squeeze, GME would likely need to demonstrate long term profitability and growth. If MM's continue to believe GME's business model is dead, they will continue to be short as they can wait the 2 years it takes for GME to die. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the play, I personally think that GME is going to use the boost from console revenue to change its business model and help GME adapt to the tech age. With an already decent supply of cash (735 million as of 7/31/20), as well as major investors like Michael Burry (Big Short Guy) and Ryan Cohen (CHWY co-Founder) backing GME, all we need is a change in business model to trigger the squeeze. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Call leaps if you love to gamble your life savings, Shares if you're slightly less of a degenerate than the rest of us",

        "selftext": "Well ladies and gents, I dumped about 40% of my life savings into the market when everything hit the fan in March. I chose lots of risky investments in the hospitality and travel industries because that\u2019s what I know, and I knew who would survive the shutdown. \n\nI also dove into options trading for a short while during lockdown. I ended up losing 20% of my portfolio to options (options are not my jam apparently lol) , and then I gained 70% profit with my stocks. \n\nThis week I officially cashed out all of my portfolio for an overall 55% gain in 7 months. Definitely happy with that but it would have been more if I never played the option gamble. \n\nI thought i would hold on to these investments longer... but with lingering talks about another shutdown and with covid cases skyrocketing, I foresee the market taking a huge hit again, especially if Biden holds on to his presumed win. \n\nSo here I am, waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen with covid, the election, and the beginning of 2021.\n\nThe huge boost from vaccine news was enough for me to say screw it and sell mostly everything. It\u2019s not everyday that your entire portfolio jumps 30% in one morning. \n\nHappy with that decision but now I\u2019m lurking to make my next investment plan when the economy figures itself out over the next couple of months.\n\nAnyone else cash out this week?",

        "selftext": "  \n\nAlright guys, it\u2019s your favorite Adderall munching retard back again with another stock DD (here is link to my last one [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0z2zy/an_in_depth_look_into_robloxrblx_and_why_i_am/). This time I\u2019m going to look at another potential meme stock that is being COMPLETELY overlooked by WSB and why it has the extremely high probability of just exploding in value like Palantir come 2021. \n\nNow my analysis of CCL is broken down into 5 parts: Covid Vaccine, credit market sentiment, insider trades, pent-up demand, and the balance sheet. Since this post is pretty long, a TL;DR will be provided at the top of each section. \n\n  \n\n**Covid Vaccine**\n\n**TL;DR:** High probability of vaccine rollout in the US starting early to mid-2021. Once this news hit the market, investors will start pricing in a post covid world for travel companies and the stock could go back to ATHs as things go \u201cback to normal.\u201d\n\nWith the recent announcement of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines having a 95% efficacy rate, we are starting to see a massive shift into cyclical stocks and some capital outflow away from WFH stocks like Zoom. Although I am still long-term bullish on these tech stocks, I still believe that this flow into cyclicals still have a LONG WAY to go before it is exhausted. The reason why I am saying this is because travel stocks like CCL, AAL, etc are still trading more closely to their March lows than their ATHs pre pandemic. This is our opportunity because I believe the reason why travel stocks haven\u2019t yet recovered to their ATHs like tech is that even though a vaccine is priced in, the rollout of it has yet to be. Right now there is no solid set date but I think that a 2021 rollout of vaccines in the U.S has a very high probability. The reason why I say this is because the US will be the first country to rollout its vaccine ([vaccine date](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/28/america-will-be-the-first-country-to-roll-out-a-covid-19-vaccine)) and in Canada where I live, our government already said that the Pfizer vaccine will receive the green light this year and we can start receiving the first shipments of it early next year ([Rollout Timeline](https://globalnews.ca/news/7489967/coronavirus-vaccine-available-canada/)). Once these dates become more set in stone, I believe the market will start pricing in a world post covid and this could be the catalyst to boost travel and tourism back to their ATHs and maybe even higher. Right now, I think one of the main reason why a lot of investors are hesitant to invest in CCL is because of the winter months and they want to see how it all rolls out, but remember, stocks are forward-looking and once vaccines are being rolled out, don\u2019t be surprised if this final barrier of price resistance is broken and investors start rushing in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  **Credit Market Sentiment**  \n\n**TL;DR:** Bond traders are extremely bullish on this company meaning that the fundamentals are still rock solid despite the no sail order. Because of this stock is extremely oversold and is trading well below what its justified based on core fundamentals. \n\nSince most of you probably don\u2019t know this, CCL did two major debt offerings during the pandemic, and boy oh boy did the investors gobble up every dollar. \n\nCCL did their first debt offering back in April 1 by issuing out $4bil in debt that paid 11.5% coupon. Demand was so great for the bond that of the $4bil offered, $17bil was used to bid up the price. It was so frenzied that Carnival decided to issue out an extra billion AND cut its coupon rate, something that was unheard of in an investment grade company ([Debt Issuance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/record-752-billion-of-bond-sales-shows-rush-for-cash-buffers)). \n\nYeah you read that right. When the stock of the company is cratering down into the 9 levels of hell, bond investors remain extremely bullish on the company. This might seem confusing to some of you but keep in mind that credit investors look at different factors than equity investors. In the credit market, transactions are still done dealer to dealer and investors are mostly concerned with whether or not a company is able to pay back its debt with its future earnings buy focusing on the fundamentals. Because of this, credit markets are often a good indication on a company\u2019s fundamental value and where the economy is likely to head in the near future. Judging by the high demand for the company\u2019s debt it would appear that despite having a no sail order, the fundamentals of the company remain relatively intact and the stock is most likely extremely oversold back in March. \n\nCCL\u2019s second offering was a couple of weeks ago in November and guess what, investors gobbled up that shit to. This time the company issued $2bil worth of debt and unlike last time, the company won\u2019t pledge collateral. The demand for CCL\u2019s bonds are so high right now that the debt they issued in April at just under 12% is now trading at a significant premium and yielding only 5%. This means whoever bought their debt back in April can now turn around and sell those bonds back to market at a massive gain because with bonds, the interest rate goes down, price go up. \n\nTo sum this part up, it would appear that the credit market is extremely bullish on the long-term prospects of this company. Since the credit market is more focused on the fundamentals, it would appear that the sell off back in March was extremely over done for the company and the stocks are most likely trading at a heavy discount. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Insider Trades**\n\n**TL;DR:** Company insiders are eating up shares like a fat kid does cookies. I have never seen such rampant insider buying before. Get in retards. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7Paying attention to what the company\u2019s executives and BoD are doing are a pretty good way of seeing where the company is likely to go in the near future. So I went on Quiver Quantitative and gentlemen, what I found was truly shocking. Here is a snapshot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/imb2fskxte261.png?width=1611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9356324fcb6128da8ba67e6e9528c27358e71370\n\nWhat you are seeing there is a ratio of almost 21:1 for shares bought to sold. This is probably the highest ratio I have ever seen for any stock, ever. What this means is that company insiders are extremely bullish on this company and if they are willing to put this much money where their mouth is, you should probably to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Society\u2019s View On Cruises**\n\n**TL;DR:** People that go on cruises could not give two shits about the coronavirus. There is an extremely high pent-up demand for cruises to resume as shown by the 100,000 volunteers that showed up for a trial cruise by Royal Caribbean.  \n\nI\u2019m going to keep this part simple. People don\u2019t care about the virus as much as the media likes to put them out to be. Right now there is SERIOUS pent-up demand for cruises to be back at full steam again. A good example of this is that recently Royal Caribbean wanted to arrange trial cruises in order to convince regulators that it can run successful Covid-free trips. Guess how many volunteers the company could find? 100? 1,000? Well, if you guessed 100,000 you are correct ([Link](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/royal-caribbean-cdc-trial-cruises-covid/index.html)). \n\nThe company is completely blown away by this and it really shows how much pent up demand there is for cruises. \n\nAs an icing on the cake, here is a link for a Joe Rogan clip in which he discusses cruises with guest Tim Dillon: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmSpQq60-Ls&amp;ab_channel=JREClips) \n\nThis clip essentially explains what cruise people are really like and whether or not the industry is simply going to \u201cgo away.\u201d Spoilers, it\u2019s not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n**TL;DR:** Financial statements are rock solid. Total assets outweigh total liabilities by a long margin meaning company is extremely solvent. Current cash outflow suggests that the company has more than enough to outlast most of 2021 without having to raise capital. Lastly, company can also easily raise debt to handle any short term liquidity needs. \n\nThe balance sheet is fucking solid. Total assets out-weigh total liabilities by 19.5bil which should put to rest any fears of solvency. Current assets are about 900million short of current liabilities but judging by the ease in which the company can raise cash, liquidity shouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s21qncpbue261.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=616caf3b2be1088492d14fe650214bae6f5c3be9\n\nIn addition I also looked at their operating cash flow and with 0 cruises, they have -4.6bil operating CF for 9 months ended. But considering their current cash balance of 8.1bil, they easily have enough cash to cover most of 2021 and that\u2019s not even considering raising capital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/srkqasbfue261.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9563579ab2ba5054962186c6d06ef14ac4bb9498\n\n**The Play**\n\nPlay stocks or long term ITM or ATM calls. The idea is to profit off of the potential pop in price come 2021 when things most likely get back to normal when the vaccine rolls out. Do not buy far OTM or FDs for this play as anything can happen to the rollout causing a dip in price. If you are buying options go for options that expire preferably near year-end 2021. That way theta gang won\u2019t eat you alive if vaccine rollout gets delayed.",

        "selftext": " \n\nYou can\u2019t be a serious trader without really understanding tax strategies. I know it\u2019s some boring accountant BS, but it\u2019s one of the few things, other than $420 TSLA calls and shorting NKLA at $50, that is actually free money. Good tax decisions save you money in most cases with little or no change to your risk level. I regularly see people do stuff on this forum that is exposing them to huge tax liability. And, doing it wrong can cause you to actually zero out your account AND owe a ton of money next year.  So, here\u2019s a crash course on how to do this. The year is almost over, and you need to do this stuff NOW to be in good shape for your tax bill next year. \n\n**The basics:**\n\nTaxes are incurred in a few ways. First, whenever you SELL a security, you realize a gain or loss that is a taxable event. Secondly, when you hold 1256 contracts at year end you get marked to market (oil futures, NDX, SPX, etc). You usually wont have these. And lastly when you receive dividends, which no one on this sub ever has.\n\nOf course, you only get taxed on gains\u2026 offset by losses that you made in the past or the SAME YEAR. The big danger with a year like this is you have massive gains that you\u2019ve realized\u2026 which means you\u2019ll owe massive taxes. If you trade with that money and lose it next year, you\u2019ll not be able to mark those against your gains, and you could hypothetically zero out your account with a dumb trade next year, AND owe a ton of taxes. Also note that if you are at a net loss, you don\u2019t owe tax, and the residual losses carry forward to protect you from taxes on the same amount of some future gain. I believe you apply STCG to STCL first, but in the absence of that, you can use LTCL. Same for LTCG vs LTCL, THEN STCL.\n\nThese taxes are generally due the following year (unless you made a ton, more on that later), and will generally be your top income tax rate plus a little (ACA surcharge of a few %), unless you have LTCG (unlikely on this forum), or have a lot of losses to offset (likely on this forum).  \n\nLastly, each position has \u2018tax lots\u2019 which are the individual times you entered the position. If you sell less than the full position, most brokerages will try to sell whatever will cause you the least taxes, which means, it will sell to make losses first, small gains next, large gains last. \n\n**Random Tips and Things To Know:**\n\n*Doom Scenario* \u2013 If you take away one thing here \u2013 if you made big gains, realize losses to zero them out, and on anything leftover, SET ASIDE THE MONEY. You\u2019ll owe this tax on gains EVEN IF you zero out your account on January 2nd. Don\u2019t put yourself in that position.  I talk about this in detail here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqewaw/psa\\_dont\\_forget\\_to\\_lose\\_all\\_of\\_your\\_gains\\_before/\n\n*Loss Harvesting* \u2013 A common year end strategy is to dump your losers BEFORE the end of the year so you can put them against your gains. If you have some old now worthless options sitting around that wont expire until next year, there\u2019s big benefit to selling these off if you have gains.  TLDR \u2013 realize your losses, probably now or really soon. Beware wash sale though\u2026\n\n*Wash Sales* \u2013 If you sell something at a loss, and rebuy the exact same thing within 31 days, the realize is cancelled out, and the loss is added back into the cost basis of the stock. You still can get this gain, you just don\u2019t get to call it a realized loss and offset gains with it. In theory, this MAY apply to call options on the same ticker\u2026 but it\u2019s a grey area, and the IRS has not given clear guidance on this for decades despite this being a known issue. Proceed with caution here. It is agreed that if you use the EXACT SAME option, wash sale 100% applied. For different options on same ticker, it\u2019s grey and not agreed upon by CPAs (conservative rule is \u2013 assume it\u2019s a wash sale). \n\n*Splitting gains over tax years* \u2013 If you have phat gains now, hedging a bit and realizing some now, some early January may be prudent so you can spread the income over lower tax brackets. Easy strategy to do.\n\n*Holding for LTCG* \u2013 In theory, if you hold an option or stock more than a year, it becomes LTCG rate which is lower. But who does that here? Hedging these gains with put options is considered kosher with the IRS.   So, if your SHOP you got in March is up 1000% and you want to sell now, you could just buy puts into March to protect, then realize then, and pay fewer taxes.\n\n*Income Offset* \u2013 You can writeoff $3k of losses against your primary income every year for free, no questions asked. But it does eat into your loss reserve. \n\n*Estimated Quarterly Payments* \u2013 When you make lots and lots of money, you are expected to pay those income taxes before filing date in April. This varies by states, so check the rules if you are making A LOT (100k+ usually). For federal, you owe these up until the point where you have paid the full amount of federal tax you paid the previous year \u2013 amounts over this you aren\u2019t on the hook to pre-pay. There are guides online for how to play a 1040-es and so forth. TLDR - make a lot of money, check your state rules, and make sure youve paid as much federal already or will have paid by end of year as you paid last year.\n\n*Charitable Donations* \u2013 Charitable donations do reduce tax liability. Better is to DONATE SHARES to a donor advised fund, such as what Fidelity offers, then direct the DAF to give to the charity of your choice. Money in there can also appreciate over time, so you can day trade further, albeit with indexes only. The reason this is better than donating cash is you get the writeoff of the value of the shares, AND you don\u2019t cause a capital gains realize \u2013 so no capital gains tax. I would not donate options \u2013 you can, but they\u2019ll get marked to market in a somewhat unfavorable manner unless massively in the money, and even then, check before you do it!\n\n*Trader Status* \u2013 You can elect to be a trader every year at normal filing deadline. If you do, ALL of your gains/losses inside designated accounts become income instead of STCG. This is desirable because losses can then go against your income, and you also don\u2019t pay the ACA surcharge on investment income. You also can deduct more things against this. But, this has strict rules to do, and only applies if you are making dozens of trades a week, trading daily, and are really making a lot of money doing it. Note that this loses the ability to use 1256 taxation and ltcg in these accounts, so its sometimes just worse. The main advantage is in bad years you can put it against your Wendy\u2019s w2. \n\n*1256 Contracts* \u2013 These are special contracts that give you 60% LTCG and 40% LTCG regardless of the hold. XSP, SPX, NDX and RUT options do this, as do most futures contracts. They also are wash sale immune, and are grown up trader hacks. I have a long ass post about this all here, but the TLDR is that for non-long-term holds with significant amounts of money, you really should be using these instead of SPY, QQQ and IWM.  Here\u2019s my post about that:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes\\_and\\_spy\\_vs\\_spx\\_iwm\\_vs\\_rut\\_qqq\\_vs\\_ndx\\_please/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes_and_spy_vs_spx_iwm_vs_rut_qqq_vs_ndx_please/)\n\n*GLD and SLV* \u2013 These are collectibles rate. Even worse taxes on long term than normal LTCG. FYI. Here\u2019s a treatise on why you should use other vehicles than these:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop\\_overpaying\\_taxes\\_on\\_gld\\_options/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop_overpaying_taxes_on_gld_options/)\n\n*Constructive Sale* \\-  If you have a long position that has made a lot, but is unrealized, and you do some crazy option trade to basically sell it (such as selling calls that are massive in the money), the IRS may decide this is a constructive sale and call it a realize. Don\u2019t get too clever on this stuff. It usually doesn\u2019t come up, but if the tax bill is large enough, it may.\n\n*QOZ:* Special tax rules for ultra rich traders with good resources, like that guy who made $5m day trading PLTR. If you made hundreds of thousands of dollars in gains, and have net worth over a few million bucks (qualified investor comfortably), you could enroll in a QOZ. This allows you to defer payment of tax on designated gains for 6 or 7 years, get a 10% discount on the amount owed, AND the investment you make is tax free on gains AND can still do return of capital with a cash-out refi (usually real estate). Getting good QOZs is hard, they aren\u2019t easily accessible, and you\u2019ll likely want to use a family office, a rich friend, or a wealth manager if you go this route. This truly is a bonanza, but it\u2019s hard to access. You have 6 months from when you realized a gain to use this. K-1s and 1256s count as dec 31 of that year realize.",

        "selftext": "So you want to begin buying stocks?  I\u2019m 33 years old, and begin investing during college (more than 10 years ago).  I\u2019ve learned a ton, and built a substantial portfolio over the 13ish years since I began.  I\u2019ve also done a lot of dumb stuff over the years, and learned a lot of expensive lessons. To me, this is the roadmap to begin investing.  \n\n\n\n***Step 1) Be sure you\u2019re financially ready to begin investing.***\nIn my view, building an investment portfolio is like framing a house.  This is an incredibly important step in your financial security, but needs to be done after you\u2019ve laid the foundation.  I highly recommend Dave Ramsey\u2019s baby steps (I consider my stock account baby step 4).  Read this and watch his youtube.  Bonus points if you can answer callers questions before Dave does on his radio show.  Another great resource is /r/financialindependence .  your stock portfolio should not be money you need in the next 5 years, preferably 20 years.  Put it in there, and don\u2019t take it out.\n\n\n***Step 2) understand your goals the first year (Year 0-1)***\nIn the first year of investing you have three main goals.\n\n \n\u2022\t**Don\u2019t chicken out.**  Pulling the trigger is the hardest part.  You make your first buy then you open your account 30 times the same day to see how it\u2019s performing.  You\u2019re probably doing this not because you\u2019re afraid of losing money, but you\u2019re afraid of failure or looking stupid.  You might tell yourself, if I learn to do research I can increase my chances of being right. This is dumb.  The most important thing is to start the trip.  Think to yourself, if you need to travel across the country by road and your options are to take the minivan you have now, or wait 3 days until you can get a sports car. Which is a smarter move?  Get your ass in the minivan.\n\n\u2022\t**Don\u2019t commit a financial blunder.**  For any of you who play any competitive video game with a ladder you know there is a commonality across all of them.  To climb out of the bottom 50% of any ladder, all you have to do is not commit blunders.  You don\u2019t have to do anything fancy, you don\u2019t have to be flashy, just don\u2019t fuck up.  This is 100% true in the stock market as well.  This means you don\u2019t have to do any financial analysis your first year.  Keep everything as simple as you can to start.  There is still plenty to learn from investing in an ETF the first year, and the third bullet will take enormous amounts of energy.\n\n\u2022\t**Learn to manage your emotions.**  The first year is an emotional whirlwind no matter how much you\u2019re investing.  Your primary goal above nothing else is to learn to act calmly.  If you check your account value every day, you\u2019re training your brain to inject dopamine every time your account goes up.  This is really, really bad.  You\u2019re going to have a bad day in the market, and your brain doesn\u2019t get the dopamine hit that It\u2019s used to. This leads to panic selling and grief.  If you learn this skill early, I\u2019m 100% convinced your set for life.  The rest is easy.\nThe other part of this bullet is Reddit is the Instagram of stock market gains.  People only post what they want you to see.  Only the best get upvoted.  This gives us a warped sense of reality, and what our expectations should be in investing.  Don\u2019t get caught in the hype. Don\u2019t YOLO.\n\n***Step 3) what do I do after that? (Year 2-5)***\nHoly shit, if you make it here, the fun begins. If you can master your emotions you can then begin to nurture this hobby.  Continue regular contributions to your account. Once it\u2019s in the stock account, don\u2019t think of it as spending money anymore, it\u2019s now investment money.  Find elements of the stock market that interest you and learn more about it.  \n\nIf I were to give one thing that you should begin learning now and have down cold it would be \u201cWhat changes a stock\u2019s price and how does that relate to the value of a company?\u201d\n\n-understand what market capitalization is, an how it relates to a stock price.  What financial tricks can a company play, and how will that affect the stock price, but not the market cap? To me, this is critical to understand.\n\n-be able to know the rough market cap if any major public company you come in contact with on a regular basis. \n\n-Time value of money.  You don\u2019t need to know the math, just the concept.  How this relates to opportunity cost. \n\n-understand how earnings and earnings calls actually affect stock price.  You don\u2019t need to actually monitor these, but just understand how earnings and earnings expectations relate.\n\nOnce you get that down you\u2019ll find other areas of stocks/ finance that interest you. Do you like to do financial analysis? Learn that.  Do you like to think big picture? Invest your time there.\n\n***Become an investor, not a trader.  Investors are \u201cgood business collectors\u201d.***\n\nAs you contribute more money into your account, begin picking up individual companies.  Your contributions should be retentively small compared to your overall portfolio.  If it\u2019s not, then contribute more to your ETF.  For the next 5 years, commit to having no more than \u00bd of your portfolio in individual companies.  This will mitigate risk, and allow you to learn about individual companies and how to look at them.  My suggested method for finding your first few individual companies are \u201cWhat industries are coming in the 3-5 years, and what companies are the best positioned to be there\u201d.  Only do that for industries you understand (unless you\u2019re a doctor don\u2019t mess with bio-tech).  Some of the meme stocks, are actually great for small individual stock pickups in this stage.  Don\u2019t invest in penny stocks (or anything with a market cap under $2B) until you know what you\u2019re doing.  I\u2019ve lost way more money in shit like this than anything.  Also, don\u2019t fall for value traps (moderate or shitty companies selling for a deep discount).  It might work every once in awhile, but that\u2019s not our game.\n\nI hope this helps someone out there.",

Ultrasound isn\u2019t new of course, but traditionally it has been performed by specialty trained ultrasonographers. it uses sound waves rather than radiation, removing ionizing radiation from the picture. the limitation of the current US model, especially in resource limited or acute care settings, is the time from ordering the study to completion and interpretation by a radiologist (1hr or more) or communities without access to ANY imaging.\n\nUS teaching to doctors and advanced practice providers has EXPLODED in the last 3-4 years, with medical schools and residencies integrating IS training and fellowships as standard.\n\nIn the near future, providers in acute care settings will be expected to utilize US as a diagnostic tool, and it is a very exciting time for many of us.\n\nBUTTERFLY NETWORK has changed the game forever. they offer an US probe that was the first of its kind. it is small, and attached to your phone or tablet and provides very high quality US imaging on demand.\n\nThis is HUGE. \n\nThe limitation was cost ($2000). but the cost limitation is over\n\nYesterday, BUTTERFLY announced their newest generation of POCUS, the IQ+ at the same price as their first generation model.\n\nThe first generation model may now be found on ebay by sellers for around ($1000). \n\nprices are going down and providers now have visual window access orders of magnitude better than the traditional stethoscope.\n\nBUTTERFLY is not yet publicly traded, but it\u2019s main investors are the BILL and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nother companies have followed suit that ARE public:\n\nFUJI FILM\nGE\nSAMSUNG\nHITACHI\nTOSHIBA\n\nand others have developed their own versions, but none have offered the diagnostic quality at the price of BUTTERFLY.\n\nForget big pharma.

        "selftext": " December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.\n\n They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.\n\nHere are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Affirm\n\nSymbol: AFRM  \nFiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  \nRevenue growth: 93%  \nGross margin: n/a  \nNet loss: $113 million\n\n[Affirm\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)\n\nFounded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm\u2019s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.\n\n**Pros**: Affirm says its \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.\u00a0 As e-commerce grows, there\u2019s plenty of room for growth in the market\u2014less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers\u2019 ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.\n\n**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm\u2019s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.\n\n## Airbnb\n\nSymbol: ABNB  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  \nRevenue growth: -32%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $697 million\n\n[Airbnb\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)\n\nAs the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.\n\n**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb\u2019s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it\u2019s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.\n\n## DoorDash\n\nSymbol: DASH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  \nRevenue growth: 226%  \nGross margin: 53%  \nNet loss: $149 million\n\n[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)\n\nAfter moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash \u201cdashers\u201d deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.\n\n**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square\u2019s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.\n\n**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash\u2019s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash\u2019s business model.\n\n## Roblox\n\nSymbol: RBLX  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  \nRevenue growth: 68%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $206 million\n\n[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)\n\nMuch more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).\n\n**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans\u2019 app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.\n\n## Wish (ContextLogic)\n\nSymbol: WISH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  \nRevenue growth: 32%  \nGross margin: 65%  \nNet loss: $176 million\n\n[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)\n\nOvershadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the \u201caffordable\u201d segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.\n\n**Pros**: Shopping online isn\u2019t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish\u2019s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\n**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish\u2019s business with new rules or requirements.\n\n[https://fortune.com/2020/11/25/2020-ipos-airbnb-roblox-affirm-wish-doordash-predictions-going-public/](https://fortune.com/2020/11/25/2020-ipos-airbnb-roblox-affirm-wish-doordash-predictions-going-public/)",

The Federal Reserve rode to the rescue once more, and the S&amp;P 500 hit fresh record highs (though lately investors have since grown cautious again).\nYoung investors\u00a0may conclude that bumper returns are all but guaranteed in the years ahead. If only steadily rising stock prices were always the case.\nConsider the FTSE 100, an index of some of Britain\u2019s preeminent pharmaceutical, energy, mining and consumer goods companies. In price terms (ignoring the impact of reinvesting dividends for a second), the U.K. benchmark is lower now than it was two decades ago. It\u2019s not alone.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark also remains beneath its dot-com-era peak while the MSCI emerging markets index topped out in 2007 and has yet to recover. The market that really refutes Portnoy\u2019s assertion though is Japan: The Nikkei 225 index remains about 40% below its 1989 peak, when a massive financial bubble burst.\n\n\"Stocks Only Go Up\"?\n\nFollowing a financial bubble Japanese investors suffered years of poor returns\n\nCould the U.S. market face a similar fate? There\u2019ve been bleak periods before, most famously in the two decades that followed the 1929\u00a0Wall Street crash.\n\nLong Hangover\n\nU.S. stocks took a long time to recover from the 1929 Wall Street crash\n\nAs recently as 2012 the S&amp;P 500 was below its 2000 peak. Value-orientated asset managers like GMO\u2019s Jeremy Grantham think\u00a0something similar could happen again, but it\u2019s not just well-known Cassandras who worry. Hedge fund\u00a0billionaire Ray Dalio\u00a0of Bridgewater Associates and Blackstone\u2019s vice chairman Tony James\u00a0have both warned about a\u00a0\u201clost decade\u201d\u00a0for equity investors.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019d followed GMO\u2019s advice in 2013 to steer clear of American large-cap stocks and load up on emerging market shares, you\u2019d have missed out on seven years of stellar returns.\u00a0So what\u2019s different now?\n1. Extreme valuations\nEquity\u00a0valuations have grown even more extreme. During the pandemic, they have become completely divorced from economic fundamentals thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s largess.\u00a0A stock market bubble pulls forward expected returns from the future, setting investors up for probable disappointment later on. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly when past returns are most glorious that future prospects are most dismal,\u201d investor John Hussman, another famously bearish investment manager\u00a0wrote recently. He\u2019s described today\u2019s menu of choices for passive, long-term investors as\u00a0\u201cthe worst in history.\u201d\n\nExpensive Stocks\n\nU.S stock valuations aren't at dotcom era levels, but they're certainly not cheap\n\nThe CAPE ratio uses a ten-year average of inflation-adjusted earnings to smooth out short-term noise\n\n2. Ultra-low interest rates\nLow interest rates are often portrayed as bullish for stocks because\u00a0they boost the value of future corporate cash flows in today\u2019s money and reduce the cost of servicing\u00a0debt. But with U.S. short-term\u00a0rates now at zero, the Federal Reserve may find it harder to juice the stock market. Ultra-low rates also reflect pessimism about future economic prospects. \u201cWhen real rates are low, future returns on equities and bonds tend to be lower rather than higher,\u201d Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton wrote in Credit Suisse\u2019s\u00a02020\u00a0compendium of past market returns. \u201cInvestors should assume a sober view of the likely excess returns equities can generate from here.\u201d\n3. Profit margin reversion\nA key determinant of equity returns, profit margins have been unusually high over the past couple of decades. But corporate profits have now suffered a massive hit due to the pandemic. Even without the virus, those oversize\u00a0earnings should eventually dwindle as competitors spy an opportunity. Monopoly power may hinder this, but dominant tech companies are\u00a0starting to face more competition\u00a0and stricter antitrust enforcement. Globalization is also\u00a0in retreat and workers are demanding are a fairer split of the rewards of capitalism.\n4. An aging population\nThis is often considered a key reason for Japan\u2019s prolonged stock market slump.\u00a0Although the U.S. is aging less rapidly, the demographic changes underway are bound to have an impact on future equity returns. An aging population may be less productive, lowering potential economic growth. Furthermore, by 2030 the large and asset-rich U.S. baby boomer generation will all be over the age of 65, and they may need to cut their exposure to risky stocks or sell financial assets to fund their retirement, weighing on prices.\n\nWhile this all sounds bleak, it\u2019s some comfort that over the very long term stocks have tended to go up. In nominal terms, one dollar invested in the U.S. market in 1900 was worth $58,000 by 2019, according to the Credit Suisse market returns study, or an annualized 6.5% return when adjusted for inflation.\u00a0In the meantime, there are a few things young investors can do\u00a0to avoid being caught out by a duff decade for U.S. stocks.\nFor starters, if returns are lower I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll also need to save more to build wealth. Consider adding some exposure to non-U.S. equities, which may at last be due a period of outperformance relative to the U.S. And by reinvesting dividends you can still obtain decent returns even if stock prices go nowhere. (The FTSE 100 has fallen 19% since the turn of the millennium, but investors who reinvested dividends received a 63% return in that period.)\nHopefully, the gloomy scenario I\u2019ve painted won\u2019t materialize and U.S. companies will develop new technologies that power the economy and the stock market to new heights in the next decade. But if that doesn\u2019t happen, you\u2019ll be prepared.\n\n\u00a0",

But see, how he says AES does the same thing and isnt getting as much hype?\n\n I'm not saying AES will go to $1000, but I think it deserves a $23 price target, the one morgan issued BEFORE earnings.

Now, I'm no technical analyst, but AES is EXACTLY at its pre-covid highs, and just check the options chain for yourself on yahoo, or barchart. The volume and open interest is OUTSTANDING. \n\nThere is a serious chance for this stock to break out, wallstreet is waiting for a break to $23 based on the options. I have $1800 on the company!!!

No? Well, let me give you a rundown:\n\n\\*Autist reads about a million pages of subprime housing loan structures.  \\*Determines that they are unsustainable and eventually they will go into default. \\*Goes to a big bank and purchases CDS, or credit default swap to short the housing market. \\*Doesn't buy puts because he isn't a  gaybear, or something. \\*Housing market collapses, he makes billions.\n\nSo that's basically it. Lazy, poorly explained rundown? Yep. And fuck you, just go watch the movie.\n\nSome of his other notable trades this year are:\n\n* GME,  which he bought back in Q1 2020, and we all know how that shit worked out. \n* PDS, which he purchased 4 million shares of at around $0.75 in Q2,  currently trading at $17.85. \n* BBBY, 1 million shares bought around  $10.60, currently trading at $20.24 \n* CPA, flipped 155k shares, bought for around $50.56, currently trading at $75.78.\n\n[13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm)\n\n**Overview**\n\nI  could go on, but my point here is Christian Bale is extremely autistic,  and if you want to be autistic too, go long on one of his recent additions per his latest 13F: LUMN Technologies. Mr. Bale added a  whopping 800k shares in Q3, his 4th largest addition to his portfolio this past quarter.\n\nWhat is LUMN,  you ask? Well, they are formally Centurylink. And yes, we all know how much of a shit company that was. Hear me out though.\n\nA  lot of companies are going through a bit of a renaissance these days.  COVID is forcing public companies to be smarter, more efficient, and adaptable.\n\nOut are the boring days of boomer telephone lines. Centurylink has transformed themselves into  Lumen Technologies, switching their focus to helping companies enter the  \"4IR\", or Fourth Industrial Revolution. The term makes me gag.\n\nSome of their business exposure includes:\n\n* Adaptive  Network Systems \n* Advanced Collaboration Platforms \n* AI-Driven Adaptive  Threat Intelligence \n* Edge Computing \\*Hybrid Cloud Networks\n\nNow I'm no network engineer, but that shit sounds pretty fancy right?\n\n[LUMN](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html)\n\n**Financials:**\n\n* Recently beat their Q3 earnings, with non GAAP EPS at .40, the consensus estimate was .34.\n* EBITDA was $2.19B, and the company grew net income to $366M from a year-ago $302M.\n* Adjusted net income rose to $430M from $328M last year.\n* Generated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $1.794 billion for the third quarter 2020.\n* Revenues fell 3.4% overall to $5.17B, compared to $5.350 billion for the third quarter 2019.\n\nBut revenue being down is bad right? Shut the fuck up, LUMN has almost fully recovered their revenue stream from last year, showing solid management in an era of COVID.\n\n[Q3 ER](https://ir.lumen.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Lumen-Technologies-Inc-Q3-2020-Earnings/default.aspx)\n\nI  think this is a positive growth stock moving forward.

I swear, it\u2019s a 2 minute read: \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTwo years after Citron Research editor and notorious short seller Andrew Left made a bold bullish call on Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE: NIO), Left said Friday it\u2019s finally time for investors to cash out of the red-hot EV stock.\n\nBack in November 2018, Left compared Nio to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) when Nio was trading at around $7 per share. Today, Nio shares are trading at $53. *($46.70 at the time of this Reddit post)*\n\n\u201cAfter a rocky road of trading, NIO has found itself in unchartered territory that can never be justified by its current standing in the China EV market or its near-term prospects,\u201d Left wrote Friday.\n\n2 Vulnerabilities: Left said Nio has two major vulnerabilities in the near-term.\n\nTesla\u2019s Model Y price cuts will apply significant pressure to sales of Nio\u2019s ES6 hatchback model. Last month, Tesla sold nearly twice the number of vehicles in China that Nio sold, and Left is expecting China\u2019s EV market to continue to be an intensely competitive pricing environment.\n\nLeft is not a fan of Nio\u2019s share structure.\n\n\u201cWhile we commend Baillie Gifford (love those people) and early investors, right now we are looking at a share structure and an investor base that is more interested in spinning a casino wheel,\u201d said Left. He also noted Nio's short interest is approaching a two-year low.\n\nWhat Nio Investors Are Buying: Left said investors buying Nio today should understand what they are getting into.\n\n\u201cAnyone buying NIO stock now is not buying a company or its prospects, rather you are buying 3 letters that move on a screen,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLeft said there are better ways to play the China EV story: \u201cIt is time for investors to rotate out of NIO, enjoy your profits and look for the next disruptive technology.\u201d\n\nLeft's new price target for Nio is $25, suggesting more than 50% downside.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take: There\u2019s no question the Chinese EV market will be a major growth story for years to come. But Nio\u2019s market cap has now surpassed Daimler\u2019s despite the fact that Nio sells roughly 5,000 vehicles per month and Daimler sells about 1 million vehicles per month.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n*Thoughts?*",

        "selftext": "# $NVAX Summary\n\n1. Novavax (NVAX) is slightly behind Pfizer/Moderna/AZN/JnJ in the COVID vaccine race but will likely end up with the **most effective vaccine** with the **fewest side effects** and will be the **easiest to distribute,** as if only requires standard refrigeration (4 degrees Celsius).\n2. Many people think that the \\~95% efficacy data from PFE/MRNA means that we're in the clear, but the data refers to 95% prevention of **symptomatic disease and not 95% prevention of infection**, which is an important difference that has been largely overlooked. **Based on pre-clinical and Phase 1 clinical data, I think NVAX will be significantly better at not only preventing symptomatic disease, but also better at preventing infection and transmission.**\n3. Importantly, NVAX's COVID vaccine (NVX-CoV2327) is the **only candidate that can be multiplexed with a flu vaccine resulting in a long-term revenue stream beyond the initial wave of vaccinations** providing a convenient option in the likely scenario that annual COVID boosters are recommended. \n4. The mixed results of yesterday's AZN interim update create a buying opportunity for NVAX, as AZN's vaccine candidate was a major competitor as the other low cost, easily distributed vaccine for most of the world. Another near term catalyst within the next 1-2 weeks is an interim update from the Phase 3 UK trial that began in September. Buyout rumors are yet to be substantiated, but NVAX is an attractive acquisition candidate with a market cap of only $6B.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My background:**\n\n* Scientist for 5+ years in vaccine R&amp;D at a major pharmaceutical company. Currently a biomedical PhD candidate at a top 5 program (whatever, nbd)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** I've been in and out over the last couple of months but waited until yesterday to load up. Plan to also add shares.\n\n* Dec 18 '20 100c\n* Dec 18 '20 110c\n* Jan 15 '21 110c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bottom line:** I think $NVAX is being overlooked due to the recent wave of vaccine news but will end up being the clear vaccine of choice for most of the world and will significantly outgrow it's current $6B market cap. I think short-term catalysts (Phase 3 interim updates, potential buyout) will drive the price higher in the next couple of weeks and like the long-term outlook (global vaccine distribution, annual flu/COVID combo vaccine, potential buyout). **This stock has low float and one piece of positive news will send this back to at $120.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# DISCUSSION (skip if you're not interested in the science)\n\n**Why I think $NVAX will produce the most effective vaccine and why this matters**\n\nOne of the most important correlates of protection used to estimate vaccine efficacy is the amount of antibodies the vaccine generates in the host, also referred to as **antibody titer** (high titer = high levels of antibody). **NVAX has reported significantly higher antibody titers than any of the other candidates in phase 3 trials: \\~6-fold higher than MRNA, \\~10.8-fold higher than PFE, and \\~10.5 fold higher than AZN** (see graph below; source: [RA capital](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/COVID-19_VX_11062020_D.pdf?v=XM0HdrTJDriIT5wg2aGibyy_vnxZt0mIHMi3grCiQ0A)). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmall differences in antibody titers shouldn't be overinterpreted, however large differences are more likely to be meaningful and correspond with measurable differences in real-world changes in immunity. **Based on the titer data reported to date, we would expect NVAX to have the highest efficacy.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Note the log scaled y-axis](https://preview.redd.it/qzig6e3de4161.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16e50ae47c7ea372247e97cc22fa0176f3cf7497)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore convincing support for NVAX comes from primate challenge studies in which rhesus macaques were given vaccine or placebo and then exposed to the virus. **Monkeys vaccinated with NVX-CoV2327 had zero evidence of viral replication in either the upper or lower airway, whereas monkeys vaccinated with MRNA's vaccine (the most effective vaccine reported to date) had evidence of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways (see graphs below; top graph is NVAX, bottom graph is MRNA).** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcsd30c6n4161.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c97bb3e889cd45a031a7fdb4841f717eaa2816ec\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sq47cz58n4161.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=655951710581046b64d769dc3bfc581ce9da007e\n\n**Bear with me, but this data is significant for reasons that require a bit of explanation**. First, it's important to understand that protection in the upper airway (i.e. nose/throat) from COVID infection is more challenging to achieve than in the lower airway (i.e. the lungs) with intramuscular injected vaccines. This matters because a vaccine that only protects the lungs without also protecting the upper airway will likely prevent severe disease in the lungs but may not prevent viral infection ([reference](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20096693v1)). In other words, it might prevent a person from getting really sick but it won't prevent them from transmitting the disease to others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on Moderna's challenge data shown above, their vaccine seems to fit the profile of mostly preventing infection in the lungs combined with a lesser degree of protection in the upper airway (at least in rhesus macaques). Now, you might say who cares about a primate challenge study if we have real-world clinical trial data in humans that says the vaccine is 94.5% effective? The reason I care is because all of the interim numbers that have been reported to date refer to the **efficacy of preventing symptomatic cases only and not of preventing infection** ([source](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy)). This is a huge deal and is almost certainly not the way that the public has interpreted the headlines to date. (UPDATE: this exact point was addressed by Moderna's CMO this morning [source](https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-chief-medical-officer-vaccines-interview-2020-11)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we assume that the non-human primate challenge data presented above is representative of what will happen in humans then I think the efficacy numbers that are being thrown for around for Moderna (and likely Pfizer/AZN) don't tell the full story and **I suspect that the sentiment about the efficacy of these vaccines will change over time**. Again, you might ask who cares - this level of efficacy still sounds really good and I completely agree that it's impressive for first generation vaccines made in under a year. These vaccines will be important for rapid immunization of high risk groups and I would gladly take one knowing everything I know now if I was high risk. However, I expect that this overlooked issue of **disease prevention versus infection prevention** for the PFE/MRNA/AZN vaccine candidates will start getting more air time. Even if it doesn't, the infection data (rather than just the symptomatic disease data) will eventually be released as a secondary endpoint for these trials at some point in the next couple of months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnlike Moderna's challenge study, **NVAX provided complete protection in both the upper and lower airway,** ***despite using a higher viral challenge dose*****. This fits with the superior antibody titer data and leads me to believe that there is a high probability that NVAX will not only have a higher rate of reduction in symptomatic cases but may also provide sterilizing immunity in a large subset of patients, therefore not only preventing disease but also preventing transmission in a subset of patients**. If the challenge data ends up translating in humans - and I think it will - then NVAX will end up having a significantly superior vaccine to the others currently in Phase 3 trials. The potential for NVX-CoV2327 to also prevent infection instead of only preventing symptomatic disease is a big deal and is why I think NVAX is going to become the vaccine of choice even though they are a bit behind their competitors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Who cares if NVAX ends up with a more effective vaccine if the others will be available first?**\n\nNVAX will probably miss part of the first wave of vaccinations for front line workers and high risk individuals if the current timelines hold, but this is a small group of people. However, I anticipate we'll get an interim update from NVAX's Phase 3 UK trial in the next couple of weeks and for all the reasons outlined above, **it will be clear that NVAX has the best vaccine well BEFORE the majority of people have been vaccinated**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNVAX is targeting having 100M doses ready by the end of 2020 and will be producing hundreds of millions of doses per quarter beginning 1Q 2021, reaching an annual run rate of 1 billion doses per year by the end of 2021 ([source](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf)). NVAX has an agreement in place from the UK to purchase 60M doses and an agreement with Canada to supply up to 76M doses. NVAX has an exclusive licensing agreement to produce 1B doses for India and other countries in the developing world and has a partnership with Takeda to produce 250M doses per year for Japan. **As a result, I anticipate that NVAX will also have the supply to be able to capture a significant portion of mass vaccination efforts.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I think there is a high probability that annual COVID booster shots will be recommended for most people for the foreseeable future and if so, NVAX stands to benefit the most.**\n\nDue to the novelty and severity of COVID-19, I think it's highly likely that periodic (if not annual) boosters of a COVID vaccine will be recommended for most people, especially those in high risk groups. There are several reasons that NVAX will be the primary beneficiary in this scenario - I'll begin by explaining why it's unlikely that the current crop of competitors will be suitable for this application:\n\n1. mRNA-based vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) are very painful and I suspect that people vaccinated with them on the first round will be hesitant to get in line and take them again once other more traditional options are available. They're also more expensive per dose and have additional cold chain/logistical challenges.\n2. Vector-based vaccines like AZN/JNJ cannot be re-administered due to vector-based immunity. Your immune system develops an response against the vector itself leading to limited efficacy in subsequent doses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNVX-CoV2327 on the other hand, has none of these downsides and is well suited for use in this context. Furthermore, NVX-CoV2327 has the potential to be multiplexed with a flu vaccine into a single shot which is an extremely attractive option. Flu vaccinations will probably become even more important in the future with COVID circulating and getting people to take one shot instead of two increases the probability of compliance. NVAX makes a flu shot (Nanoflu) that reached all primary endpoints in a Phase 3 trial and is being submitted for accelerated FDA approval. Nanoflu uses the same adjuvant as NVX-CoV2327 so the potential for being able to multiplex the two vaccines is high. **The bottom line is that NVAX has the potential for a significant stream of recurring revenue from COVID booster shots that PFE/MRNA/AZN do not have**. A multiplexed flu shot would be the icing on the cake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\n1. The market is underappreciating the the fact that interim vaccine data has shown 95% effectiveness of **preventing symptomatic disease and not 95% effectiveness of preventing infection** and therefore transmission. In my opinion, NVAX will be significantly better in this regard and be in high demand if/when this distinction is made.\n2. NVAX will not only be the most effective vaccine but will be the best COVID vaccine investment due to it's high total addressable market (favorable cost/distribution) and potential for recurring revenue, in conjunction with only a $6B market cap (Moderna has a $39B market cap).\n3. Interim update of Phase 3 UK data represents a significant near-term catalyst. Potential for acquisition cannot be ignored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI probably missed a few things but this has taken way too long and I need to go back to work. I will do my best to answer any questions. \n\nThank you for your time.",

        "selftext": "So I quite frequently see that your best investment for long term strategy is to just buy and hold something like VOO.  I've been questioning if it really is because it doesn't seem to be as diversified as people may think. With consideration of the index being 22% FAAMG, it doesn't seem to be THAT diversified. Also a good chunk of the companies are probably companies will never recover, have even stock price, or continue to downtrend?  Is the s&amp;p really that great of a bet if you're willing to do just a little bit of active management and weed out some of these garbage companies? Is it ok that there will be companies that don't perform well, because those will be smaller %s of the fund? But even then, why have that dead weight in your portfolio?\n\nI guess I'd really just love to know what y'all think, if you agree or disagree, or if you can open my eyes to the light for this so I can be more confident in investing in something like VOO. It's hard, especially now, to keep putting money in VOO when I've been splitting my money evenly between VOO and QQQ and see QQQ drastically outperform.  I'm in my mid 20s, so maybe its worth staying riskier with QQQ and VOO isn't worth it for me? Would appreciate some thoughts!",

        "selftext": "Back in September 2019, Michael Burry predicted an index fund bubble. Since I invest index funds and write about them with relish, I was intrigued. But I quickly moved on.\n\nThen another headline caught my eye. It was an episode of Odd Lots podcast titled,  [**\u201cWhy Passive Investing Might Be Distorting the Market.\u201d**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2020-02-07/why-passive-investing-might-be-distorting-the-market-podcast)   I immediately listened to the episode, featuring investor and fund manager Mike Green. And then I listened again. Considering a lot of my net worth is currently tied up in index funds, I want to understand why some people think index funds are fools\u2019 gold.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to play devil\u2019s advocate and talk about both sides of the conversation. Is there an index fund bubble? A market crash around the corner? Or is passive investing still the winning strategy it\u2019s always been?\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find compelling arguments from investors Mike Green and Michael Burry, who both say there is a bubble. Then I\u2019ll follow up with comments from financial analyst Ben Carlson and portfolio manager Ben Felix, both of whom see no bubble . It\u2019s #TeamMike vs. #TeamBen. I\u2019ll also pull some soundbites from Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund manager who now produces financial videos with a silky British accent. And then I\u2019ll add in my own thoughts at the end.\n\n# Quick reminder: what\u2019s an index fund?\n\nAn index fund owns a wide assortment of assets (e.g. stocks), and owns those assets in proportion to their market share. Uh\u2026that\u2019s a lot of FinSpeak. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nFor an example, let\u2019s look at an S&amp;P 500 index fund. An S&amp;P 500 index fund would own all of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Since Apple and Microsoft each make up about 5% of the S&amp;P 500, this index fund would be comprised of about 5% Apple and 5% Microsoft. But Chipotle would only compose about 0.08% of the index, because it\u2019s 0.08% of the S&amp;P. In this way, the index fund is benchmarked to the S&amp;P, like a shadow that follows all of the body\u2019s movements.\n\nSimilarly, a \u201ctotal stock market fund\u201d would own every stock in the market. There are tons of options in the index fund world.\n\nLet\u2019s get into the arguments that claim indexing is now in a bubble.\n\n# Part I \u2013 Bubble! \u2013 \u201cThe tail is now wagging the dog\u201d\n\nOne of Mike Green\u2019s first points on Odd Lots is this: the original idea behind indexing is that active traders and actively managed funds will dictate how the market behaves, and that a small number of passive investors (e.g. index funds) can simply go along for the ride. The large majority active traders are the dog; the minority passive investors are the tail. The dog does what it wants. The tail only follows.\n\nIf dogs don\u2019t do it for you, I like the boat analogy. Think of actively managed funds and active traders as large cruise liners and passive investors as a small canoe. The cruise liner picks its course. The canoe ropes onto the cruise liner and gets a free ride. The cruise liner doesn\u2019t notice the small canoe\u2019s drag whatsoever; its course is unaffected. This big-small relationship is the original assumption behind passive investing. Market behavior is dictated by the active majority, and the passive minority gets a free ride.\n\nHowever, asserts Green, we now live in a paradigm where active and passive investing are too close in size. Therefore, the fundamental assumption no longer rings true.\n\nMillions of Average Janes and Joes\u2013individual investors\u2013are using index funds to invest huge portions of their income and savings. After all, that\u2019s how many 401(k)s and their non-American equivalents are set up. Green points out how recent U.S. legislation changes are pushing 401(k)s and passive investing even further into the mainstream.\n\nPassive investing is no longer the \u201csmall tail.\u201d It\u2019s no longer the canoe. It\u2019s now a fairly large boat, and the active management cruise liner is impacted by towing such a large passive boat.\n\nThe past 30 years have seen index funds grow and grow. Index fund inflows are the \u201csingle largest transactors in the market by far\u201d Therefore, by definition, they are not passive. Index funds have to be influencing the market. What might this influence look like?\n\n# Passive investing influences the market\n\nLet\u2019s go back to our S&amp;P 500 index fund from before. The S&amp;P 500 went up \\~30% in 2019. Where does this gain come from?\n\nSome of it probably comes from fundamental growth in the S&amp;P companies. They\u2019re doing better! Active investors respond by saying, \u201cIf the company is better, then these stocks are now worth more!\u201d\n\nAlternatively, what happens when millions of individual investors put their retirement savings into S&amp;P 500 index funds? It\u2019s simple supply and demand. Joe and Jane are increasing the demand for S&amp;P stocks, therefore the price will increase.\n\nWhen Joe and Jane were the \u201csmall canoe,\u201d their demand didn\u2019t affect the market. But these passive investors are no longer \u201cjust along for the ride.\u201d They are actively impacting the ride. Last year\u2019s 30% price increase is not based only on fundamental growth. Instead, the Average Janes and Joes are artificially increasing the price of the S&amp;P 500 via their demand for index funds.\n\n# The effects of \u201cindex inclusion\u201d\n\nWhat about \u201cCompany 501;\u201d that is, the first company not in the S&amp;P 500? Well, it does not receive the benefits of being a part of the S&amp;P 500 index funds. It does not receive the demand that occurs from inclusion in that index fund, and this exclusion affects Company 501\u2019s price.\n\nMike Green says that historical data clearly shows this growing impact on asset values\u2013it\u2019s called \u201cindex inclusion.\u201d This is true for all sorts of index funds. They include some stocks, exclude others, and there\u2019s a recognizable delineation between those included and excluded.\n\nGreen says there\u2019s a \u201cdistinct and permanent shift in the valuation and price levels associated with these securities\u201d when they are included or ejected from an index. Companies inside of indices are receiving more attention than they fundamentally deserve. Companies outside of indices, therefore, are getting the cold shoulder. This lack of true valuation is one of the formative factors of a bubble.\n\n# \u201cFire!\u201d in a theater\n\nIn the past 40 years, passive investing has done nothing but grow. But eventually, that growth will end. Individual investors will retire. Withdrawals will take place. What happens when you take the money out?\n\nAt that point, Green states that the artificial inflation of index funds will cease, and quickly turn south. As more retail investors sell, prices will drop. When investors see prices dropping, they\u2019ll get scared and sell more. The vicious cycle will continue\u2013sell, drop, sell more, drop more\u2013into a index fund crash. It\u2019ll be an old-fashioned bank run.\n\nOr, as Nicholas Nassim Taleb has written, \u201cthe market is like a large movie theater with a small door.\u201d If everyone is looking to get out, the only way to do so is to offer the doorman a better price than the other people. Prices will plummet. Pop goes the index fund bubble.\n\n# Is it the British accent?\n\nRaoul Pal looks the part, sounds the part, and produces his videos while sitting in front of monitors chock full of financial data. My bulls\\*\\*\\* detector is whirring to life, but something about that accent is just so factual.\n\nPal\u2019s argument is that baby boomers\u2013through no fault of their own\u2013have been dumping too much money into passive funds (pensions, 401(k)\u2019s, etc). When they start selling en masse\u2013which will happen soon!\u2013then pop goes the index fund bubble.\n\nThere are 76 million baby boomers in the U.S., and their average age is now 65 years old. The wave of retirees is about to crest. And when they start to pull money out for retirement, we will see the large theater/small door issue. Prices will plummet.\n\nBut, says Pal, index funds aren\u2019t the only issue. Boomers will also face issues trying to sell their houses. They\u2019ll have issues trying to sell their material goods. Baby Boomers were such prolific consumers that the economy will be overwrought will all their stuff, and prices everywhere will fall. Growth will cease as markets are flooded with goods. A vicious cycle will ensue.\n\nAnd then \u201cthe doom loop of corporate debt will get ignited.\u201d Oh no, not a doom loop! In short, says Pal, corporations have recently gotten into the habit of:\n\n1. Borrowing money (this is the corporate debt)\n\n2. Buying shares of their own stock\u2014a.k.a \u201cstock buy backs\u201d\n\n3. \u2026which drives the price of their stock higher (P.S. this is an artificial price increase)\n\n4. \u2026which makes the company appear more valuable, and usually lets the biggest stockholders (e.g. the executives) get extra rich\n\nAnd Pal\u2019s right. Corporations have been gluttons for their own stocks in recent years. Just read about Apple\u2019s buyback tactics.\n\nEventually, these corporations will have to pay back their debts. And their artificial valuations will come back to Earth. Stock prices will plummet. Indexes and pension funds will plummet. And Baby Boomers\u2019 selling will cause further pricing drops.\n\nAnd thus, claims Pal, the third Baby Boomer crash will occur. And every good story has the symmetry of threes.\n\n# Problems with Pal\n\nMy core issue with Pal is that he\u2019s as much a story teller as he is fact teller. And therefore, it\u2019s hard to tell if he\u2019s selling olive oil or snake oil.\n\nFor example, this sounds impressive: \u201cThe baby boomers accumulated the greatest concentration of wealth the world has ever seen. And they\u2019ll destroy it too.\u201d Whoa! Rise and fall. The double-edged sword. The boomer giveth, and the boomer taketh away.\n\nPal provides facts to back up his claims. But most of his facts are arguable at best.\n\nThe 2000 Dot Com bubble? It happened because Boomers flooded the stock market with their investments, says Pal. And then \u201ceverything got dashed on the rocks, as those markets collapsed.\u201d\n\nThe Baby Boomers\u2013then age 45 on average\u2013turned to real estate, says Pal. Can you guess what happened next? The 2008 Subprime Mortgage and Financial Crisis! Baby Boomers are so many in number, says Pal, that their sum-total behavior can\u2019t help but create bubbles.\n\nAfter 2000 and 2008, the Boomers were worried about their retirement savings, goes Pal\u2019s argument. So now they\u2019ve got to take risk, and they were forced to do so in the stock market. Well, what\u2019s the easiest way to invest in stocks? Through passive investing! And as we\u2019ve now learned twice\u2013according the Pal\u2013where the Boomer money goes, a bubble will soon follow.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice story. It has symmetry. It has foreshadowing. It\u2019s narrated with a silky British accent.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it has an iota of truth. Euphoric day-trading of \u201c.com\u201d companies led to the 2000 Dot Com bubble. Passive investing is the exact opposite of that kind of behavior! Perhaps the money is coming from some of the same people, but that\u2019s not evidence for the existence of an index fund bubble. Pal is grasping at straws.\n\n# Michael Burry: Big Short to Big Bubble\n\nMichael Burry is an investor and hedge fund manager who correctly foresaw the 2008 financial crisis, and managed to make a boat-load of money for himself and his customers through his correct prediction. If you\u2019ve seen the movie The Big Short, Michael Burry is played by Christian Bale.\n\nBurry\u2019s argument for an index fund bubble is a less scary than Green\u2019s, and certainly less apocalyptic than Pal\u2019s.\n\nBurry\u2019s claim is that indexing has caused an artificial bubble that\u2019s inflating stocks inside the index, and thus leaving stocks outside the index ripe for the picking. It\u2019s the \u201cindex inclusion\u201d argument again.\n\nBut where Green sees a dangerous bubble, Burry sees more of an opportunity. Ready for another metaphor?\n\nImagine a pair of identical twin basketball all-stars. Everything about them is the same, including their skills. Except that one twin plays college ball for Duke\u2013he\u2019s always on TV\u2013while the other plays for Harvard\u2013a good academic school, but not a basketball Mecca.\n\nThe average basketball fan would be biased towards the Duke player. He\u2019s on a better team, he gets more media coverage, and has more post-season success. The average fan would certainly believe that the Duke twin has better long-term prospects, and therefore would deserve a bigger professional contract.\n\nBut since I built this strawman hypothetical, you and I know the truth! The two twins have the same exact skill set. Therefore, signing the Harvard twin at his lower price would actually be quite the financially efficient move.\n\nMichael Burry\u2019s claim is that this is what\u2019s happening with passive investing. Near-identical companies are being over- or under-valued due to their index inclusion or exclusion.\n\nStocks that are inside of index funds are like the Duke twin\u2013they are being over-valued simply because of where they are. While stocks not in the index are like Harvard twin\u2013they are under-valued, and therefore should be targeted by smart people looking to make more money.\n\nIn my opinion, this is less of a \u201cindex fund bubble\u201d and more of an \u201canti-index opportunity.\u201d\n\nBurry is simply saying, \u201cThere\u2019s an inefficiency here, I\u2019ve discovered it, and I plan on making money off it. P.S.\u2013come invest with me so we can both make money together.\u201d\n\nGood work, Mike! Go exploit that inefficiency!\n\n# Price Discovery is becoming fragile\n\nBurry\u2019s second claim is that price discovery is becoming fragile. \u201cPrice discovery\u201d is a fancy term for \u201cbuyers and sellers determining a price where they\u2019re willing to make a deal.\u201d\n\nThink about Craigslist. Someone wants $200 for a used snowblower. Snow?! Yes, in Rochester it helps to have a snowblower. So, you take a look at the snowblower and counteroffer $150. The owner haggles back to $175\u2026and you have a deal! That\u2019s price discovery.\n\nTypically, stock market price discovery involves many buyers and sellers conducting detailed analyses of a company\u2019s holdings and profits and cash flows\u2013all of the fundamental business metrics.\n\nBut passive investing doesn\u2019t care about those fundamental metrics. Instead, passive investing simply follows the leader. It assumes that others in the market have already done the fundamental research, and that the current price of a stock is \u201cright.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit like saying, \u201cThe last Craigslist used snowblower went for $200, so I\u2019ll buy the next one for $200 sight unseen.\u201d Are you sure you want to trust the last buyer and seller? What if they were dopes? Don\u2019t you want to look at the snowblower and make a decision for yourself?\n\nSince passive investing doesn\u2019t rely on price discovery, Burry argues that prices are now dangerously skewed from what traditional price discovery would suggest. This cannot go on forever, and eventually the prices will snap back to where they fundamentally belong.\n\nOr, you could say, the index fund bubble will pop. This, Burry says, is very similar to how housing and CDO pricing behavior malfunctioned before the 2008 crisis. It will be a painful, painful snap.\n\n# Part II \u2013 The other side: Index funds are fine\n\nWhile I appreciate the logic behind Misters Green and Burry and Pal, there\u2019s plenty of good money still betting on index funds\u2019 future success. Let\u2019s start with [**Ben Carlson**](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2019/09/debunking-the-silly-passive-is-a-bubble-myth/). . Ben is financial analyst, author and blogger (nice!), and podcast host. I\u2019m a big fan of A Wealth of Common Sense (the blog) and Animal Spirits (the podcast). Thanks for sharing all the good work, Ben.\n\nAnyway, what does Ben have to say about the index fund bubble and passive investing?\n\n# The tail is not wagging the dog.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get back to dogs and tails and boats. Carlson writes, \u201cIndex funds hold less than 15% of shares in public companies.\u201d While this is a growing number\u2013it was 3.3% in 2002 and 6.8% in 2009\u2013passive investing is neither a majority nor plurality.\n\nIf we combine all exchange traded funds and all mutual funds, that percentage rises to about 35% ownership of all shares. That means that active investors\u2013the dog\u2013own at least 65% of the equity market, and therefore are still wagging the tail. All is well in the dog/boat metaphor universe, says Carlson.\n\n# Bias! Bias! Read all about it!\n\nAnother of Carlson\u2019s arguments is that active investing, by nature, is biased against passive investing. Passive is stealing active\u2019s business share, and now active is biting back.\n\nPassive investing shadows what the active investors are doing. But rather than spending money on research and trades, passive investing keeps expenses\u2013and fees\u2013to a minimum. Passive has all the profits of active investing, but none of the costs: ipso facto, passive investing is better. And the active investors don\u2019t like it! The \u201cindex fund bubble\u201d is their propaganda technique.\n\nBesides, let\u2019s consider any and all claims that passive investing is doing something \u201cwrong.\u201d Logically speaking, anything that passive investing is \u201cdoing wrong\u201d first has to be done by active investors.\n\nYou can\u2019t blame your shadow for flipping you the middle finger\u2013the shadow only copies the source. Similarly, passive investing only copies what active investors are doing. It\u2019s a simple argument in logic.\n\n# The price discovery argument\n\nPrice discovery is a cop-out, says Carlson. There is way more trading occurring today than most times in the stock market\u2019s history. In the book Index Revolution, author Charley Ellis writes that about 95% of all trades today are done by active managers\u2013there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for price discovery. It\u2019s all about trading volume.\n\nThis means that the prices aren\u2019t skewed. The prices aren\u2019t a stretched rubber band, ready to snap back. There\u2019s no index fund bubble, waiting to pop. Instead, the active investors are setting the prices and price discovery is healthy.\n\n# So what\u2019s Michael Burry worried about?\n\nBesides, Carlson says, when else in life do we expect individuals to actively partake in price discovery? Do you haggle with the grocery cashier about the cost of oranges? No! All over our economy, prices are set and individual consumers simply choose to buy, or not. They don\u2019t barter or bargain.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I agree with Ben\u2019s point here. It\u2019s true: we don\u2019t haggle at grocery stores. Instead we\u2019re presented with Hobson\u2019s choice\u2013we either take it, or leave it. If you don\u2019t want to pay $12 for a bag of oranges, you don\u2019t have to.\n\nBut are people thinking about Hobson\u2019s choice when they passively invest in index funds? I don\u2019t think so. I think a lot of people are \u201cblindly\u201d putting their bi-weekly 401(k) contributions into index funds, regardless of the price. There\u2019s not much \u201ctake it, or leave it\u201d going on. It\u2019s just \u201ctake it.\u201d\n\nMy conclusion: index investors might be blindly buying in, but they\u2019re still buying at a price that was intelligently discovered through the fundamental analyses of active investors.\n\n# Ben Felix from YouTube\n\n [**Ben Felix**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv0pJh8mFk0) is a portfolio manager at PWL Capital, and popular creator of YouTube financial/investment videos.\n\nI really like one of Felix\u2019s foundational arguments against the idea of the bubble. That idea is: assets under management do not set prices; instead, trading sets prices.\n\nSo Green and Burry should not be asking, \u201cHow much money is in indexes?\u201d Instead, the question should be, \u201cHow much trading is done by indexing?\u201d This means that the size of the boats doesn\u2019t matter. In fact, it means the boat metaphor doesn\u2019t really make sense.\n\nSo let\u2019s relate it back to the quote from Charley Ellis: 95% of all trades today are done by active managers. That means that price discovery is dominated by active trading. And it means that there shouldn\u2019t be any bubble driven by price discovery.\n\nBlackrock, another investment management firm, estimates that for every $1 of passive trades, there are $22 of active trades. Again, this points to the same conclusion: there is no issue with price discovery.\n\n# Some ideas from the academics\n\n Felix quotes a couple serious economics papers\u2013one by [**Fama/French**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=502605), another from [**Palia/Sokolinksi.**](https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/Paper_P%26S_Darius.pdf) \n\nFama &amp; French came to the conclusion that it doesn\u2019t take much active investing to create an efficient (i.e. non-bubble) market. Passive investing, they say, is pushing bad active managers out of the market. And those who remain? Only the skilled active managers. It\u2019s survival of the fittest. Culling the weak should only make the market more efficient. More efficient = better price discovery = no bubble.\n\nPalia and Sokolinski have a really interesting theory. In brief, they claim that index funds drive down the cost of short selling, which makes short selling more efficient, and that leads to better price discovery.\n\nThey start with the simple truth that index funds hold onto lots of stocks. And since the supply of stocks is high, index funds can easily lend out those stocks to short sellers (people betting that a stock will go down). The short seller pays the index fund a small fee, which gets passed onto the passive investor in the form of low costs.\n\nHowever, since there are so many index funds out there, the short sellers have many different options of where they borrow stocks from. With high supply comes low prices. They can find their short sources very cheaply. This makes the cost of shorting go down.\n\nAnd thus, conclude Palia and Sokolinski, passive investing is creating a more efficient market for short sellers, and a more efficient market leads to better price discovery.\n\n# Part III \u2013 Home-grown arguments and takeaways\n\nNow that you\u2019ve heard the smart people talk, let me bless you with my pro-index ideas.\n\nFirst, index investing is self-corrective.\n\nTo wit, let\u2019s take another look at Michael Burry\u2019s argument: \u201cpassive investing has an inefficiency in undervaluing non-indexed companies, and I plan on taking advantage of that.\u201d\n\nIf Burry is correct, then more active managers will follow his lead and make their money. And right behind them will be their shadow a.k.a. passive investing. The market is a self-correcting system, where money flows towards the best values. Passive investing simply follows that flow of money.\n\nIf passive gets too influential, then the smart active managers will exploit the problem. Inefficiencies will balance themselves out in the long-term. And passive investing is a long-term technique.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s easy to avoid the pitfalls of index inclusion.\n\nIndex funds don\u2019t have to exclude stocks. Many investment managers (like Fidelity and Vanguard) offer total market index funds. They include high and mighty S&amp;P companies and all of the \u201ccompany 501\u2019s\u201d out there that might be excluded from other index funds.\n\nTherefore\u2013if there is an index inclusion bubble\u2013the total market index funds own both sides of that bubble.\n\nA total market fund would only be exposed to a bubble that includes entire asset classes. For example, one could claim that stocks in their entirety are overvalued, but that commodities are undervalued. Therefore, a total U.S. stock market index fund would still expose you the bad outcomes of bursting bubble!\n\nIf this concerns you, then diversify your index investing via a lazy portfolio. There are indexes that track bond markets, international markets, different sized companies, commodities, REITs, etc. You can spread out your investments across multiple asset classes to reduce your risk.\n\n# Takeaways\n\nGreen and Burry both make good points. Pal tells a nice story. I\u2019m really glad I took some time to understand those ideas. Carlson and Felix support the ideas I\u2019ve always heard: the wisdom of people like Jack Bogle and Burton Malkiel. What actions am I taking after all this conversation?\n\nReading. Lots more reading. I want to learn more about Mike Green, Michael Burry, and their anti-passive compatriots. After all\u2013they did compel me to type up 4000 words of arguments that go against my investing strategy. But I also want to remind myself of the reasons why I started indexing in the first place: Malkiel, Bogle, and people like Ben Carlson and Ben Felix.\n\nBut I will be staying my course, at least for now. I have not been convinced to move away from indexing, or that there\u2019s an index fund bubble. Indexes still float my boat, and I think the bubble argument has more bark than bite. I\u2019m in it for the long run. I do not think hand-picking individual stocks is the way to go.",

        "selftext": "This entire selloff was pretty much fueled by a few sensationalist headlines such as \"Citron Pulls Plug on NIO\" along with a price target pulled out of the ass of a non-analyst with a history of making false and misleading statements intended to manipulate the market to his benefit. If you're unfamiliar with Andrew Left, the name Citron Research probably sounds like something along the lines of a legitimate investment firm when you see it in a headline. It\u2019s really just one guy, with a lengthy track record of lawsuits for baselessly attacking stocks in an attempt to profit off their downfall. He [sold NIO at $10 in 2019](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/citrons-andrew-left-sells-out-of-chinas-tesla-rival-nio-2019-02-26) [1] and has clearly been fuming over the profits he missed in the past months. Keep in mind, this guy has [shorted Tesla](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/andrew-left-shorting-tesla-stock-again-reasons-citron-betting-against-2020-2-1028876660)over and over without any luck, calling its meteoric rise artificial and insustainable, purely driven by hype. Now he\u2019s shorting NIO on the same premise. Calling out the lack of short interest (aka optimism) also fails to corroborate his rationale for the stock falling to $25 - why even include that? \n\nOn to his main point, which is that Tesla\u2019s Model Y is expected to move to a starting price of \u00a5275k (~41k USD), spelling trouble for NIO\u2019s competing ES6 and EC6 (currently starting at ~54k USD each). This \u00a5275k price projection is based on one Chinese analyst\u2019s report and can essentially be taken with a grain of salt until Tesla says something confirmatory. Additionally, Left is either being incredibly na\u00efve or incredibly disingenuous to assume NIO would roll over and allow itself to be outcompeted by a cheaper car model. This is a Chinese company we\u2019re talking about. Left conveniently failed to make any mention of NIO\u2019s upcoming economy models such as the ES3 and ET5 (the former being less than a year away with an expected price point of ~30k USD). Taking this into account, I don\u2019t think the competition is as steep as Left claims. Tesla\u2019s market share in China has rapidly declined in recent months as native EV companies push it out, going from [21% in august](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Electric-cars-in-China/Tesla-conquers-China-s-EV-market-with-taste-of-affordable-luxury#:~:text=Tesla%20doubled%20its%20China%20sales,to%2021%25%20from%206%25)3] to [10% as of 3 days ago](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/11/10/teslas-market-share-is-sliding-in-china-and-has-cratered-in-europe/?sh=31e2e2a36d7d). Left cites NIO\u2019s 3% market share in China as a weakness, omitting the fact that only about a year or so ago, this figure was very close to zero. NIO is years behind Tesla in terms of production capacity; he\u2019s comparing apples to oranges and he knows it.\n\nIn conclusion, Andrew Left\u2019s $25 price target is clearly not based on numbers and calculations - it\u2019s based on how much he wanted to profit off this squeeze, which was probably millions. Guy is a scumbag short seller abusing his power to manipulate the market and I hope the SEC takes a close look at him.",

SFM would not make an investment in Palantir today. \n\nHowever, Soros is wrong in his understanding of what Palantir does. They provide infrastructure to organize data. Palantir's core principle is privacy by design.

C3 markets itself as an Enterprise AI company founded by Thomas Siebel. For those that don't know, Thomas Siebel created Siebel Systems which revolutionized Consumer Relationship Management and was later bought out by Oracle. Now back to the Enterprise AI bit. Basically traditionally companies go through different vendors for each of their AI and ML needs. C3 aims to fix that problem by offering an entire suite of tools that are inter-compatible with each other causing easier usability and more productivity. They have contracts in essentially every industry with companies such as 3M, Shell, and Raytheon, AsrtraZeneca and received a $95M contract with the Department of Defense for the F35 fighters and the US Air Force for maintenance on older aircraft.\n\n# Why [C3.AI](https://C3.AI)?\n\nI won't bother you with words but I'll let the pictures from their S-1 filing do the job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojd7b196g8261.png?width=2449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94feeb7f9d8e37cccd803983b5a928e613750b05\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpb7nry6g8261.png?width=2449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3651e1b7a1bd403774524bfdfdb88d4b8cb979a7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pzly028g8261.png?width=7680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76afb284750b4698c2c57049637600a9a964f71f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mvwi9gw8g8261.png?width=7680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22b05a4f6bf3c833982f82666063674e6be99291\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8guycek9g8261.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1008e2507e9d0afb904fc24a70ca50272dd0cf74\n\n# The TL;DR\n\nSaaS Model-Driven Architecture\n\nGovernment Contracts\n\nIntegration with major cloud players\n\n71% Year on Year Growth\n\n# TL;DR of the TL;DR\n\nPalantir took us to the moon but [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) will make sure we get to the moon.\n\nShares couple days after IPO for the dip then load up on LEAPs when it IPOs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the link to their [S1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577526/000162828020016443/c3ais-1.htm) where I got most of the information from.",

        "selftext": "# Stonk Picks For The Week\n\nI posted last Sunday in [r/Options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Options/) my [plays for the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jqlhvn/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_made_4k/) and updated the thread Monday morning when I entered the position. Last week I netted about $1,500 on $80,000 or roughly 2%. Not bad considering most stonks ended lower for the week and a few of my positions were looking at risk of being assigned. [The week prior](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) I netted $4k on $75,000 or 5% return.\n\nPlease refrain from any comments such as \"only 1% per week dude you suck\". 1% per week will double your account in about 80 week. So yes that's all I aim for.\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**\n\n**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.\n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**BABA**: 1x CSP $260 strike 20 Nov expiration, 1x CSP $245 strike Nov 20 expiration.\n\nI opened the $260 strike put last week when the stock dipped, then opened the $245 strike put on Friday after the stock dipped for a second time. The $260 was down about 25% when I opened the $245 and I saw it as free money to get me back to at very minimum break-even on this particular ticker by this upcoming Friday the 20th. These 2 CSPs are taking up a fuckload of my buying power, so I will need to close them if I want to open up additional positions because I don't like being over-leveraged. If BABA gets a pop on Monday, I'll close out one or both and free up some capital if I want to enter new positions.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week\n\n**LULU - 4 week earnings run-up play**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1li7lsn4yhz51.png?width=2430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a52ab2615fbdc745084ff5eecfc0c3de87a55ce\n\nLULU has been trading in the same range for the last 5 months unable to hold the break-out, but not falling below support either. I'm feeling comfortable owning this stock around $310 range and expecting a potential run-up into earnings set to report mid December. I will look to sell Dec 18 puts to collect on earnings IV and see a potentially pump in the next few weeks. These will be about 4-5 weeks out, so I'll even sell closer to an at-the-money strike and hopefully find a good return. LULU IV isn't the best and the stock price will require a lot of buying power so I will keep an eye on some opportunities this week instead of jumping right into the play Monday AM.\n\n**Positions I'm looking at**:\n\nDec 18 $300 strike put for $9.50 or $950 in premium, 3.17% return in 5 weeks\n\n**OR**\n\nDec 18 $310 strike put for $12.50 or $1,250 in premium, 4.0% return in 5 weeks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DOCU - Earnings December 3rd**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/py6frev5yhz51.png?width=2434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b547e7f2b24e661e5e1e1b069b4a915344faad7f\n\nI made some money on DOCU 2 weeks ago. Last week stock price was crushed by vaccine news which turned out to be nothing but fluff. We can see DOCU is once again trading at the lower range of the trend/channel (pink lines). The trend is still up, but the stock price has been highly volatile failing each break-out and returning into the channel. I like selling $195 or even $200 strike puts if I can. All depends how we open Monday. DOCU is set to report earnings December 3rd.\n\n**Positions I'm looking at:**\n\nDec 4 $200 strike put for $11.00 or $1,100 premium, a return of 5.5% in 3 weeks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD - A spin-off from NVDA earnings.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z39ri90cyhz51.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43185021db634a624327cadaae0792e097e98b83\n\nI made some good money selling puts on AMD back in June/July when the stock was trading completely flat for 2 months. The price action from May-August is very similar to what it's doing now, just at lower stock price back then. Looks like it's been in a similar range for the last few weeks. NVDA options are quite expensive, so I'll be using AMD as a proxy and playing that. Looking at the fancy crayola support/resistance lines I drew I think there will be buyers if we get down to $78 or $74. I'm comfortable **HODL**ing AMD at those levels and run the wheel if I need to. In my opinion, we can see a bullish bounce from NVDA earnings. If you have the capital and want to sell against NVDA I think there is a similar play that can be found there.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nAMD Nov 27 $78 strike puts for $1.10, a return of 1.4% in 2 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TDOC - TELEDOC**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nr8v2rbdyhz51.png?width=2300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5d4f41ae7c40013b0a00df854479fca014b6577\n\nTDOC is a newly added ticker to my watchlist and I think will have good potential in the future. You might be seeing me enter this trade quite a few times in the next weeks. The TDOC chart has been highly volatile recently. I wouldn't say technicals don't matter, but it's quite possible this stock just blows past any support/resistance with ease. The stock has had a pretty good dip in last week's trading sessions and trading down 30% from the August highs. I'm comfortable selling the $175 strike put and owning the stock at that price if it continues to dip.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nNov 27 $175 put for $4.30, or 2.5% return in 2 weeks.\n\nA lot depends how we open Monday, if market has a melt-up we simply wait until entry points become favorable to us. That might not be until later in the week, but patience is always key in the stonk market. If we open down then we can sell the positions mentioned at 1 or 2 strikes lower for the same premium, that's a win-win. Don't forget we have a monthly options expiration this week and it could be volatile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope y'all had a good weekend, **lets get this bread**.\n\n**10am UPDATE:**\n\nClosed 1 of my BABA CSP's for a 15% gain, will let the other ride to expiration or close at 90% to free up capital if I want another play.\n\nAt the market open everything was moving fast. Wish I got in when everything was pretty red, but it climbed quick shortly after open. Entered only 2 positions so far, AMD + TDOC, I think I will add DOCU in there as well. I'm still liking most plays on my list, but going to sit tight for now. Lots of opportunities out there. Good luck all! Will post another update \n\n**Positions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7zcicbkdamz51.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df7ebc4702398c8337b485acbffd9caf78e196c9",

        "selftext": "Alright retards (TL;DR below) - Chinese EV and PLTR fever have taken over the sub and justifiably so. Since we have the attention span of a gnat, we need to find the next meme stonk. Enter Bill Gates, Butterfly Networks, and Long View Acquisition Corp.\n\nWhat is it? Butterfly networks primary product is backed by Bill Gates (former second richest man on Earth) and is a handheld ultra sound machine that will improve medical diagnosis capabilities in the US and around the World.\n\nHow much does it cost?  The primary ultra sound machine has multiple packages but the best plan costs 3K one time cost that gets you the machine and the subscriptions service. They also have other plans that are based on a yearly subscription (not relevant for math purposes later). \n\nCompany Basics. The company has $64.5M in revenue per year and has several competitors, none of which are backed by Bill Gates. The company is 9 years old and has received $350M in funding. They are merging with LGVW via a SPAC deal like so many companies this year and they have an actual product (looking at the incestuous loser Trevor Milton).\n\nWhy you should give a Fuck? Were going to mess around with some math (google research) to show how much money this company could make.\n\n* There are 6,146 hospitals in the United States\n* There are 230,187 private practices in the US\n* There are an additional 164,500 hospitals world wide\n   * Including 69,000 hospitals in India\n   * and 30,000 hospitals in China\n\nMy sister is a nurse and she says that this is \"the coolest shit ever, but it will get lost easily\" so that means hospitals will be all about this shit and potentially have to buy more units when it gets lost in the anal probe repository. In other words, the tech itself is legit and this makes doctors/nurses/technicians lives easier. Lets do some numbers.\n\n* Now, the average hospital (sister knowledge) has between 5-20 ultrasound machines floating threw a hospital.\n   * If every hospital in the US had 5 machines that's $92M in revenue\n* There's an additional 230K private practices in the United States\n   * If each private practice had 1 machine, that's $690M\n* Now, lets talk about international\n   * There's estimated to be 164,500 hospitals worldwide which adds up to an additional $493M\n   * Additionally, Doctors, missions, nonprofits, and other organizations could buy one pushing the market even higher by millions.\n\nSimply put, this is an absolute cash cow in the making with the deal expected to close in Q1 of next year. All told the shitty end of my retard math estimates $1.275B in revenue on the low end and an even higher TAM. That doesn't even price in the retard strength when the WSB/robinhood hedge funds start getting involved and fucking around with it. LGVW closed at 17.39 with another 1% gain in aftermarket trading. Given the SPAC craze on the market, LGVW should have no problem heading towards the moon over the next few months.\n\nPositions: Long LGVW with 263 shares, will buy more as capital becomes available.\n\n**TL;DR Buy LGVW shares and calls. Bill Gates backs this company and he knows a thing or two about money. Their technology and capabilities are legit and its the ground floor of a fturistic med tech company. Buy before it becomes a meme. Godspeed fuckwads.**",

        "selftext": "TLDR: I believe precious metals and industrial materials markets will provide a better return on invested capital compared other market sectors and will be the main drivers of the next bull market. These industries have been cyclical for decades and this trend won\u2019t change now.\n\nAs you all may or may not have noticed, the stock market and especially the tech giants have been on an incredible run as of late. Even though many people expect a general market downturn in the near future, myself included, it cannot be denied that these companies have presented an incredible return on invested capital in the past few months and years. These shares have not been the only ones on a tear in the last few months however, with precious metal miners going up in multiples since the lows seen in march. Because of the way monetary policy is implemented at the moment, with an aggressive targeting of inflation by the FED and the printing of trillions of dollars, I have shifted my attention to what I think will be the next great bull market. Remember, just because something has been going up or going down for a long time, does not mean it will keep being this way, especially not when looking at investing in commodities.\n\nAfter the decade long bull market we have seen, what do I think will be the next bull market after all this is set and done? Commodities, specifically precious metals followed by industrial materials. We all know that when a currency is being devalued by printing trillions of it, investors tend to take their money and put it into 'safer' investments. These investments have historically been gold and silver, who last experienced great bull markets in the 1980's and after the 2000 dot-com bubble. Now it looks like everything is in place for another massive bull run, where investors will move a part of their portfolio into these assets both as a safety net and an chance to take part in the precious metals bull market. The three decade average holding of precious metals and precious metals related assets in the US has been around 2%, but today it is somewhere between 0.5 and 1%. Especially considering bonds now yield an almost negative return, I have no doubts that the average of 2% will be revisited and overshot, as the biggest competitor of precious metals is providing a negative inflation adjusted return on investment. I am a firm believer that we will see higher gold and silver prices the more the dollar (and other currencies around the world) lose value. How high? Nobody knows, but predictions of $5,000 gold and $100 silver have not been uncommon. What do you invest in? That will be discussed further below.\n\nBut am I only going to invest in precious metals? Absolutely not, because while I feel like this bull market is inevitable, I also believe that after the coming economic slowdown that will paint the next two to three years, countries are going to try their hardest to improve their own economies again. This has historically been done with heavy investments in things like infrastructure of all kinds. Regular industrial materials like copper, oil, platinum, lithium, uranium and steel have not been the best investments over the past few years, but an industrial material bull market will change all that. With an economic rebuild comes the need for these materials and because the respective prices for these materials have been relatively low over the past few years, I expect a major turnaround to incentivize the new production the world is going to need to properly get back on its feet. Prices of things like oil, lithium, copper and especially uranium will shoot up and the companies that produce these materials will go right up there with it. I am especially bullish on uranium, of which I wrote about many times of which I believe will reward patient and strong handed investors who can handle it's volatility on the way up.\n\nTo truly see how undervalued commodities are compared to regular equities in the S&amp;P 500, I would recommend looking at the chart mentioned here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commodities-watch-2020-170025867.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commodities-watch-2020-170025867.html)\n\nWhen something is so underinvested in and has all the catalysts in place to rally upwards, a subsequent bull market will be all the more violent on the upside. According to Rick Rule, one of the best commodity investors of the past few decades and CEO of Sprott Global, this will be the investment of choice for him and all his clients and after looking at the numbers, I can't say anything except I fully agree with him. This investment idea is gaining traction and while it is good to always be diversified, it would almost be foolish not to allocate at least a part of your portfolio into commodities. It is what I will be doing and I expect it to outperform the broad equities market in the coming decade. In a cyclical industry, you are either a contrarian or you are going to be too late.\n\nNow I will share with you what I believe will be the 5 commodities that will benefit the most from a precious metals and industrial materials bull market. These markets are inherently cyclical and after a decade long slowing down of these industries, it is time the cycle fully turns.\n\n1. Uranium\n\nA commodity I have talked about on here at length (if you want to know the details, check my post history) and a commodity that I feel like offers the most asymmetrical risk/reward investment one can make in the current market. In short, uranium is used to fuel nuclear power plants, which are in turn responsible for around 15% of all the power generation in the US and 10% globally. The amount of power plants is growing, mostly in Asia, but the supply has dwindled because of low prices. The price of the commodity has to at the very least double from here to incentivize the new production needed to keep the lights on. There are only a few miners left in this sector and it has a total market cap of around 12 billion dollars, which is ridiculously low for something that provides so much value to power generation. When the general investment community and institutional investors decide to invest in uranium, it will be like moving the contents of the Hoover Dam through a straw.\n\nThe companies I would look at within this commodity are: Cameco (CCJ), Energy Fuels (UUUU) and Denison Mines (DNN)\n\n2. Silver\n\nOften seen as the little brother to gold, I am more bullish on silver than gold for the simple reason that silver is used widely for industrial materials. From solar panels to phones and from medicine to photography, silver is a metal that has many uses and is thus not easily replicable. It is also the case the silver is often not produced as a separate product, but mostly as a side product when mining for things like gold and copper. Add to that the fact that silver can often not be recycled and mostly ends up on the waste dump with the electronics it is in, makes this commodity scarce. The scarcity of this commodity means that if supply is not ramped up significantly, the price will go up because of the enormous demand for this metal. Lastly, silver is also often seen as a hedge against inflation just like gold, which can be another good reason to invest in it seeing how much money is being printed.\n\nThe companies I would look at within this commodity are: Pan American Silver (PAAS), First Majestic Silver (AG) and SSR Mining (SSRM)\n\n3. Copper\n\nProbably the most commonly used commodity on this list, copper is used in almost every single electrical device or contraption you can think of. Copper is used because it conducts electricity and heat extremely well, making it a core component in and ever more electrified world. The more we as a society focus on electricity to meet our everyday needs, from electric vehicles to the devices we used to read this very post, the more we will rely on copper. It is the same story as with most other commodities, the price has to go up or there will be a shortage of the commodity. When something is so key to our everyday life, it is quite easy to see where this will go. There are also nearly no new tier 1 copper deposits in the world, so bringing new supply online is not nearly as easy as it might be with other commodities.\n\nThe companies I would look at within this commodity are: Freeport McMoran (FCX), Rio Tinto (RIO) and Lundin Mining (LUNMF)\n\n4. Gold\n\nThe thing a lot of people see as \u2018real money\u2019. Gold, for thousands of years, has been used as something to trade goods for or to back a different type of \u2018money\u2019. Even after the abolishment of the gold standard, this view of gold has not changed and it has been on quite the run recently. Gold has increased from roughly 1200 dollars per ounce at the end of 2018 to almost breaching the 2,000 dollar threshold in 2020. Many analysts believe it will not stop here, with figures ranging from 3,000 all the way to 15,000 dollar gold all being quoted. As mentioned before, with the seemingly endless printing of new money and further debasement of fiat currencies all around the world, gold is both a store of value as well as an investment vehicle. The only reason it is fourth on this list, is because uranium, silver and copper all have major industrial uses, instead of just being a store of value. However, that definitely does not mean one should pass on gold, for something that is considered as \u2018the only true form of currency\u2019 can prove to be a great investment in an ever more turbulent world.\n\nThe companies I would look at within this commodity are: Barrick Gold (GOLD), Agnico-Eagle Mines (AEM) and B2Gold (BTG)\n\n5. Lithium\n\nThe world is being electrified more and more and just like that benefits copper, silver and uranium, it also benefits lithium. Lithium is silver colored chemical metal that has many uses, but the wide use in battery technology is the reason I am bullish on the material itself. As more electricity is being generated and more renewable energy sources are being connected to the grid, there has to be a way to store part of that energy to make use of it later or in a different way. Advanced battery technology is what makes renewable energy viable on a broader scale, it is what makes all these electric cars able to get on the road and it is a relatively rare metal in high demand. I expect this high demand to increase further as we come to depend more on battery technology.\n\nThe companies I would look at within this commodity are: Albemarle (ALB), SQM (SQM) and Livent (LTHM)",

        "selftext": "There have been a couple of (excellent) recent posts here about why Novavax (NVAX) is a good play with their vaccine in trials that are likely to succeed. But much like Jim Cramer and the rest on the day the \"Pfizer vaccine\" trial results were announced, everyone is looking for related plays and overlooking the company that created the first vaccine, started it all, and is going to change the world.\n\n**Who is BioNTech, and what do they have to do with the Pfizer vaccine?**\n\nBioNTech (BNTX) created the \"Pfizer vaccine.\" Pfizer (PFE) is their partner for clinical trials and distribution (except Fosun Pharma is handling those duties in mainland China); BNTX is a direct peer and competitor to the better-known Moderna. A German company started by a married couple of Turkish immigrants, BNTX, like MRNA, has been working for years on messenger RNA-based therapeutics, especially for cancer, but it turns out messenger RNA (mRNA) is also an ideal technology for producing quick, effective, safe vaccines.\n\nMuch like PFE, BNTX tends to be quite conservative in their forward-looking public statements. This includes their initial announcement that their vaccine was \"at least 90% effective,\" which turned out to be 95% effective. MRNA also does great work, but their CEO tends to be more of a \"salesman\" - which isn't all bad, but tends to get their gains priced in earlier than BNTX.\n\n**The vaccine is not the biggest thing here though. BNTX is going to change the world.**\n\nVaccine revenue will be a big deal for BNTX (and for MRNA), and probably justifies share prices in the $140-$150 range, especially if annual boosters are needed for the vaccine (the jury is still out on that).\n\nBut the real upside in BNTX is that this vaccine - their first product coming to market - validates their entire technology platform based on messenger RNA (mRNA). Messenger RNA has been a bit of a \"holy grail\" in medicine for decades, but there were significant difficulties in turning it into a practical tool. It's fragile, and tended to induce the wrong kinds of immune reactions, from what I have read (I am not a doctor).\n\nBut BNTX and MRNA have cracked that code, using lipid nanocapsules to deliver the mRNA to cells, where it instructs the cells to create desired proteins; in the case of this vaccine, antibodies against the Coronavirus spike protein.\n\n**But mRNA can be programmed - quickly, easily, and inexpensively - to instruct cells to create** ***any*** **proteins.**\n\nImagine a future where you receive a cancer diagnosis and your doctor takes a quick blood draw or biopsy, sends the results to a lab, and a week later you go back in for a shot that instructs your body how to destroy the tumor based on the specific genetic/chemical structure of your individual tumor. A future where programmable vaccines are created in days against new infectious diseases. A future where the body can create any proteins needed to cure a huge array of diseases and disorders.\n\nIs this realistic?\n\nConsider this: the Human Genome Project - a massive scientific success - took 13 years and $2.7 billion to sequence a single human genome. Now a human genome can be sequenced for something like $150 retail and takes a few days.\n\nmRNA is going to be like that. Cheap, quick, custom therapies for many diseases that cause significant morbidity and mortality today.\n\nAnd BioNTech and Moderna are leading the way (but BioNTech is currently the better buy).\n\n**Recent price movements and comparison with peers and competitors:**\n\nFirst, the more technical side. For most of the past month (since the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine results were announced), BioNTech has traded a bit above Moderna and Novavax in terms of per-share price (their pricing overall has been remarkably similar); BioNTech has tended to command a $5 to $10 premium over the two peers, with a brief larger premium in the week or so after the announcement.\n\nBut here's the thing: Moderna and Novavax took \\~$25 per share gains Friday on the news of the AstraZeneca trial errors, while BioNTech only gained about $5 on the news, leaving Moderna and Novavax $15-$17 *above* BioNTech. That trend has only continued this morning, with Moderna now up to a $30 per share premium over BioNTech.\n\nThere is no real-world reason for this new premium. The AstraZeneca difficulties will benefit BNTX just as much as they benefit MRNA and NVAX. So why did it happen? Probably because BNTX is a German company and people think of their vaccine as the \"Pfizer vaccine.\"\n\nIn addition, Barron's published a [story](https://www.barrons.com/articles/modernas-final-covid-vaccine-results-are-imminent-billions-in-revenue-will-follow-goldman-says-51606326525) about GS noting that MRNA will go from zero sales to billions of dollars next year and raised their price target from $107 to $139. All of this is true, and is now partially priced in. But all of it is also true of BNTX - but nobody has noticed yet; it's nowhere near priced in.\n\nThe Motley Fool guys are much the same - they published a [story](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/29/3-key-advantages-moderna-holds-pfizer-and-astra-z/) about MRNA's advantages over AZN and PFE - which made valid points - but completely ignored BNTX, when in fact *every* point they made in MRNA's favor applies even more to BNTX. They argue that MRNA being small is an advantage (because the vaccine results will affect their financials disproportionately), which is true. And they note that MRNA doesn't have to share revenue, unlike PFE and AZN - also true. And BNTX does have to share revenue with PFE (I've read elsewhere 50/50), but BNTX market cap is less than half of MRNA's, which ought to put them on level ground.\n\n**Target price?**\n\nI believe BNTX can go to $160 in the near term, meaning within the next two weeks (it's at $119.97 currently). Long term? I don't know; how much money can be made changing the face of medicine, especially cancer? PFE's market cap is $207B; AZN's is $138B. JNJ is $379B. I think it's entirely plausible that BNTX joins their ranks over the next few years; current BNTX market cap is $26.5B. So maybe a 10-bagger on just shares over the next few years?\n\n**Is there a catalyst?**\n\nYes - in fact, there are two.\n\nFirst, the FDA has a meeting on 12/10 to consider BNTX's application for an Emergency Use Authorization. This is thought to be nearly automatic; I cannot see a scenario where this is not granted quickly. There seems to be some sentiment that approval may even come that very day, which would make the 12/11 calls very attractive \\*if\\* it happens.\n\nSecond, PFE and BNTX are due to publish their actual trial data in a peer-reviewed journal very soon. Quite a few people seem to be taking something of a \"wait and see\" attitude toward the vaccine, saying they don't trust \"press release data.\" This is not unreasonable. I see this as a strong upside though, because PFE and BNTX recent history is that they are \\*very\\* conservative with their public statements. The actual underlying data, when published, is likely to be even more favorable than their public statements. This is in contrast to MRNA, which tends to put the best face on their data (though their data is likely also very positive), and especially in contract to AZN, which put their spin machine in high gear with their recent results (and error) news.\n\n**What's the play?**\n\nShares ought to return 25-35% just this month, and perhaps 100% annually over the next few years. If you want to try calls, a high-risk, high-reward play would be something like 135c 12/11; lower risk but still rewarding could be 125c 12/31.\n\n**What about NVAX, MRNA, PFE, and AZN?**\n\nNovavax and Moderna probably still have some upside. Novavax is still a month or two away from their Phase 3 results, which are likely (but not certain) to be positive (they have had successes and failures in their past). But NVAX stock is currently $15 above BNTX after trailing BNTX for weeks; I think their upside is currently more priced-in than BNTX (probably, again, because \"Pfizer vaccine\").\n\nModerna (MRNA), like BNTX, is going to be part of changing the world, and should be a solid investment. But their current market cap is double that of BNTX, and their stock has appreciated more recently (also $30 above BNTX despite consistently trailing BNTX until Friday). MRNA's boost is mostly priced in now. Both these stocks got boosts as \"non-AZN vaccine stocks\" on Friday because of AZN's difficulties; BNTX was simply overlooked.\n\nPfizer is a good company with good leadership, in my opinion. But it's a huge company; vaccine profits are unlikely to be material. It will move up and down, slow and boring, and pay dividends. If you want to buy PFE you should be at r/investing instead.\n\nAZN is another giant company; their errors won't be material because they're selling the vaccine at cost anyway. But in my opinion they mishandled their communications regarding the error; I see them as another r/investing discussion, and a worse one than PFE.\n\nAll great companies, but at the moment BNTX is a bargain.\n\n**What about the cold storage thing?**\n\nYes, the Pfizer/BioNTech requires colder storage than the other options. This is a challenge, but not as big a deal as it's being portrayed by some: the vaccine ships in reusable containers packed with dry ice that can keep the vaccine at the needed temperatures for 10 days without being in a freezer, and the dry ice can be refilled to last longer than that. And it can be pulled from that container and placed in a refrigerator for an additional 5 days. Yes, cold chain logistics will require some attention, but it's not a deal breaker.\n\n**OK, but how do you know any of this?**\n\nI'm not a medical professional, but I have had a lot of free time this year because my main gig  is shut down for Covid. So I have been following Covid news since mid-January (my other business's supply chain was being disrupted), and vaccine development since the beginning. I predicted early on that vaccines would be more effective than predictions were saying (90% or more vs 50-70%), I predicted that BNTX would be first past the gate, and I figured out that they were underplaying their own trial (they \"hid\" data from themselves for a couple of weeks to avoid an early announcement in order to let the trial run, since they had to wait for safety data for FDA anyway). I purchased 2,000 shares of BNTX about two weeks before the trial announcement and made some good gains. Unfortunately I'm a novice investor; this was my first big play, and I figured out options on RH right at closing time on the Friday afternoon before the big Monday morning announcement, so I was too late by about an hour to get in on even bigger gains.\n\nI sold some shares near an early peak and bought/sold here and there since then; I currently hold 2,500 shares of BNTX shares, plus 115c 12/11 and 125c 12/31. I also hold MRNA, NVAX, \\[banned SPAC ticker\\], PSTH, and TMO in various amounts.\n\n**TL;DR:** BioNTech created the Pfizer vaccine and owns 50% of the gross profits; much like Moderna, the vaccine is their first product to market and validates a technology platform (mRNA) that will change the world of medicine, but unlike Moderna, it's being overlooked a bit and presents a serious opportunity, both short term and long term. Their CEO and Chief Medical Officer are sleeping with each other, but they're married (yes, to each other), so it's fine. I should have posted this in October when I first bought in but I hadn't discovered this subreddit yet so I didn't and I'm sorry about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmvtixkg9e261.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19262ea08d35aecd8498d2b5592bb0c091d28cab",

        "selftext": "Listen up you retards. \n\nSome of you have been enjoying a fling or two with the exotic foreigners like NIO, Li Auto, XPeng, SOLO, etc. Sure, you are a tall retard. You are just attracted to small, cute EV cars (or in the case of SOLO, retarded looking small Canadian EV with 3 wheels). They happen to be Asian but no, you don\u2019t have a yellow fever or some kind of Asian fetish.\n\nYou retards often underestimate the emotional and financial ramifications of your actions. Papa Musk has been good to you. TSLA has made you lots of tendies in the past. But today, we are going to look into why happily invested retards like you cheat on TSLA and why that\u2019s a mistake.\n\n**NIO\u2019s been making me shit load of money. I am never going back to Papa Musk**\n\nI know it\u2019s difficult to learn your lessons when you are retarded, but haven\u2019t we gone through this before? You don\u2019t bet against Papa Musk. You tried with NKLA and thought that talent-less hack Trevor Milton was some kind of second coming of messiah until you saw that fake ass video of their truck \u201crolling down the hill\u201d.\n\nNow I am seeing that you moved onto William Li. Sure, the guy is no Trevor Milton. He seems to have the right background (i.e. education, past track record as an entrepreneur, etc). He also has right investors in NIO, such as Tencent, Temasek, Baidu, Sequoia, Lenovo and TPG. But Musk already has his trump card called Model Y and I will explain to you what will happen over the next 12 months or so.\n\n**Chinese EV Demand**\n\nAccording to Barrons, China started to crack down on gasoline cars few years back. Due to congestions and pollution in the major cities, Chinese government started limiting the issuance of license plates in China. Not only is it difficult to obtain license plates for gasoline cars (i.e. it\u2019s almost like a lottery system), the cost to obtain one is more expensive. Then let\u2019s say somehow you were able to obtain a license plate and was able to afford one, there is another layer of complication: you can only drive gasoline cars on certain days of the week.\n\nBut with EVs, the government makes it much easier to get an EV plate than gas plate. There is better parking, less tolls, and no restriction on driving days. This is shifting the demand to EVs because the process is much easier to obtain a plate for EVs and overall cost of ownership is lower. \n\n**Model Y\u2019s Importance**\n\nSome of you ungrateful retards may have been disappointed by the announcements from the last Battery Day. But Papa Musk, did give you updates on the future of the battery technology (which will be covered on a separate rant), but more importantly on Model Y.\n\nPer Bloomberg, Tesla\u2019s Chinese version of the Model Y, which will be locally made in China, will be a single biggest threat to NIO\u2019s growing dominance in the electric SUV segment of the Chinese EV market over the next 12 months.\n\nNIO was doing superbly lately but on Friday, Citron Research released a bearish report on NIO that increased completion from TSLA will become more intense with the launch of Model Y in China.\n\nThe biggest advantage will be the price point. When Model Y is released in China (manufacturing will begin in 2021 and delivery also expected in 2021), Papa Musk said he will lower the price to $41,000 (vs. $49,900 in US). Papa Musk also said that monthly Model Y sales will reach 30k units. In comparison, NIO\u2019s ES6 SUV starts at $54,000. When it comes to economy of scale, NIO is unable to match TSLA (yet) and as result, TSLA will be able to sell their Model Y at a lower price point, which will force NIO (and others) to accept a wave of price cuts to their premium electric vehicle lineup. That means while TSLA keeps printing profit and increase to revenue, the rest will have to eat the loss until they can scale up as well. (But by then, Musk will be on another money making innovation, the Battery).\n\n**So what does this mean over the next 12 months?**\nJust a week ago, Tesla registered its Model Y with the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. This indicates the start of production in China (upon issuance of final production permit for Model Y from the government). Yes. Papa Musk said production to begin in early 2021 but it looks like he\u2019s ahead of schedule.\n\nAdditionally, there are reported sightings of Tesla doing road tests of its Model Y in China. \n\nNIO, which competes in the luxury segment of the EV market in China, recently reported a new monthly sales record earlier this year, delivering 3,740 vehicles in a month. \n\nThat\u2019s right retards. For anyone who wants to argue that NIO will catch up to Tesla soon and match its scale, that isn\u2019t going to happen anytime soon. Tesla can deliver 3,740 vehicles in its sleep. From the get-go, Papa Musk is shooting for 30,000 vehicles of monthly Model Y sales in China and that\u2019s only Model Y volume. \n\nIf that\u2019s not the nail in the coffin, then consider the risky strategy that NIO is taking on its battery strategy. While Papa Musk is developing an entirely new battery technology that will last longer, and hold the charge longer, NIO chose \u201cBattery as a Service\u201d strategy. What is that, you ask? \n\nWell, one of the key battlegrounds for the success of EV market will be the ability to build and maintain a more extensive EV charging infrastructure. China and US are looking to expand its charging network (i.e. number of charging stations) and both countries are investing into this infrastructure. However, NIO ha shaken a different approach to charging, focusing on battery swaps rather than charging stations. Rather than leveraging EV charging stations (that all other EVs will use in China, including Tesla), NIO is building its own network of \u201cbattery-swap stations\u201d. What this means is that NIO customers can only use NIO\u2019s \u201cbattery-swap stations\u201d where they have to buy vehicles without the battery, and instead sign up for a monthly subscription service that gives them access to battery packs depending on their needs. \n\nNow ask yourself. Would you rather own EV with its own battery that you can just charge wherever, or would you rather buy one without a battery, and sign up for a subscription service where you have to swap the battery at one of its swap stations?\n\n**Conclusion: Here are the key takeaways for you retards who failed to read my rant above**\n\n1. NIO can\u2019t compete on scale with Tesla. They recently achieved a record monthly delivery of 3,740 vehicles while TSLA can do that in its sleep. Papa Musk is expecting monthly delivery of 30,000 units for Model Y alone.\n\n2. Because they can\u2019t compete on scale, Tesla can produce and sell Model Y at a lower price point. This will force Chinese EV competitors to a wave of price cuts, which will result losses for them but not TSLA.\n\n3. Model Y is about to start production and already conducting road-tests. It is on track to launch in 2021 at $41,000 (vs. NIO which starts at $54,000)\n\n4. NIO\u2019s \u201cbattery as a service\u201d subscription program is retarded.\n\n5. Tesla will moon again in 2021 once you assholes come back to senses.\n\n\n**This is Article #3 of my rant series**\n[Article 1 - CRSR - Corsair $40c May 21, 2021 Exp](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jtbqwt/crsr_corsair_40c_may_21_2021_exp/)\n\n[Article 2 - SOLO - EV Play for Special Kind of Retards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jthfu2/solo_ev_play_for_special_kind_of_retards/)",

The stock lost some of the gains on Friday after Citron Research said in a tweet it was shorting the stock with a $20 target.

        "selftext": "you fucking autists, im gonna bring you some tendies on a bet on steel. My dumbed down version of US Steel didnt seem to get into your peanut brains so here is a wall of text to fuck you up and buy US STEEL.\n\ntl;dr: Buy United States Steel (NYSE: X). OTM calls from Jan to Apr 21. \n\nUnited States Steel (NYSE: X, $14/share) allows us to participate in a supply squeeze in the tight US Steel market, with multiple ways to win. X operates blast furnaces which are gradually losing share to nimbler, cost-efficient mini-mills. X is currently unprofitable, following covid and plant shutdown. Trading at 0.6x P/B, it is often use as a levered \u2013 ops, financial - proxy to steel prices. \n\n**The bet on X is predicated on a squeeze on the US steel supply.** There are two levels of supply that has been severely curtailed due to covid. First is on the metal service centres (distributor of finished steel), which has reduced steel inventory in anticipation of weak demand. Second is on the steel manufacturers (US Steel, AK Steel, ArcelorMittal, Stelco, JWS Steel), which have idled plants to trim costs. It typically takes time to repair steelworks, rehire workers and to restart a plant. What also been additionally unfortunate is that Arcelor\u2019s Burning Harbour furnace (1-2mt of steel) had covid infections, leading to outages. Altogether, the set-up is a super tight supply chain holding a historical low 1.5 month of steel inventory (2.5 to 3 months) and no capacity. \n\n**In face of this tightness, demand is recovering very sharply.** Americans\u2019 demand for cars are recovering, construction has picked up and industrial activity coming back online. Shipments have rose 1-5% month on month, and because supply has been unable to pick up, manufacturers must now book steel supply about 11 to 13 weeks out (vs 4-8 weeks in a normal supply environment), and most operational mills running at close to 100% capacity; merchants looking for generic steel have been unable to find any seller, according to market surveys.\n\n**Steel prices have inflected but demand pressure is unlikely to abate.** Spot prices rose from $400 to $750 just last week, with higher futures pricing in further increase of steel prices to $760 to $800, before easing to $600 over the course of FY21. Current demand drivers are still recovering with additional legs of steel demand \u2013 Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill, recent import quota on Brazilian semi-finished steel and rising steel demand globally. In fact, even at $800/ton, US steel is still trading at a discount to international steel. From industry surveys, only 10% of mill players are even willing to negotiate price (vs 50-80% historically), with most sold out till Jan / Feb. \n\nX at $3.2bn mrkt cap, $7bn EV is trading at 0.9x P/B, 3-4x EV/EBITDA with a heavily battered balance sheet. In normal times, integrated players are an easy structural short owing to oversupply and zero capital discipline in the industry. US Steel has long been an unsexy sector that is de-growth, cyclical, value-driven (which is out of favour), capital blackhole and especially struck out in times of covid. Industry utilisation is at 70% (from 54-55% pre-covid) with a constant threat from lower cost imports. Need I continue further? This is also why even when steel prices shot up post Q3, estimates for X remain flattish. \n\nBut, in face of a supply squeeze, the highest cost producer with swing capacity represents a levered bet on the upside; Every $100/ton realized price increment gives rise to +$200mm EBITDA each quarter (2mm as of Q3, total capacity 22mt, 6mt idled) and prices have already run up &gt;$200 since 20Q3 ended, even +10% since vaccine announced. A good reference would be 2017 to 2018, when 232 Tariffs led to a panic buy amongst metal service centres, sending steel prices to +150% to $1,200/t. US Steel, in the same period, rerated from &lt;1x P/B to &gt;4x. **The same narrative marks X today.** \n\n**A key risk is supply response, which will dampen the short squeeze.** Noticeably, Nucor and STLD have new capacity coming online in 21H1 and H2. Stelco and US Steel have also invested, following the windfall from 232 tariffs. However, most of these supply would come online &gt;6 months out, which won\u2019t be in time for the squeeze. Shuttered capacity has mostly been from US Steel and ArcelorMittal. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\"Another service center source serving the automotive industry said he had received a call earlier in the week about a panicked automotive OEM. The OEM was about to shutdown an assembly plant if it could not get the less than 1,000 st of steel it needed, according to the source.\n\nThe service center source said he expected it to be an exotic, hard to find automotive grade of steel but was shocked to learn it was one of the more generic grades of steel. The OEM was unable to find it anywhere and every service center contacted was out of stock and still waiting on orders from domestic mills.\n\n\"We are forecasting now that we will run out of inventory on some jobs by mid-January. We just can't get enough to build any inventory or safety stock. We are begging and appealing constantly for more tons and the orders we do have are all late, adding more stress,\" said a Midwest fabricator with automotive ties.\"\n\nSource: S&amp;P Global Platts, November 2020 survey",

        "selftext": "I asked you guys what company you wanted me to do a valuation on and PLTR was the favorite. This admittedly took me longer than I thought it would because this company is so weird and shady and honestly, next to impossible to predict. I try anyway. Feel free to jump around the text, I **bolded** main themes so they are easier to find.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Palantir Technologies was founded in 2003 and the company offers  a unique and powerful operating system (OS) to government and  commercial clients\n* PLTR has found its stride in providing  solutions to the US government, particularly in aiding intelligence,  counter-terrorism, and military\n* PLTR provides anti-money laundering and flight operations solutions to commercial clients\n* With  \\~131 customers today on lumpy deals and limited visibility into future  opportunities, let alone conversion rates, PLTR seems a company with a  binary outcome to us. Will they or won\u2019t they bring more customers on to  the platform? A single customer add changes the company\u2019s outlook, and  as a result, valuation, significantly\n\n**Company Background and Summary:** Palantir\u2019s data /  analytics platform is differentiated with its \u201cfull stack\u201d approach. For  businesses providing a product or service, **a full stack approach means addressing the complete value chain from end-to-end,**  controlling the entire customer experience instead of providing a  partial solution that relies on licensing to, or integrating with,  existing businesses serving the target market. Palantir technology is a  one-stop shop, for now, but they have shown signs of flexibility which  will be key in its growth as a company.\n\nPLTR\u2019s two core platforms include **Gotham** and **Foundry**.\n\n**Gotham:** Palantir\u2019s first platform, Gotham was built  for government operatives in defense and intelligence. Gotham enables  end user to identify patterns within large datasets and enables users to  create and execute responses.\n\n**Foundry:** This platform enables organizations to  create a central OS for their data. Users can integrate with other core  systems and analyze large datasets in a singular, consolidated platform.  Foundry is primarily targeted to commercial customers.\n\nDespite having a low number of customers, once PLTR penetrates the  customer and becomes a core data platform, thanks to this full-stack  approach they are able to expand rapidly. Average revenue per customer  (ARPC) has been growing at a 30% CAGR since 2009, reaching $5.8mm as of  2019. The top 20 customers have a spend even greater at $23.6mm. This  sort of revenue per customer growth is indicative of PLTR\u2019s ability to  prove and expand into new use cases once a customer is onboard. The PLTR  platform addresses a variety of workflows including data management,  integration, app development, security, analytics, supply chain,  enterprise resource planning (ERP,) and the mythical \\~AI\\~ among others.\n\n[Source: Q3 company presentation](https://preview.redd.it/55nkfn7os2161.png?width=944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d5692fe41f3b8f9b83d97d8d9d5b99e7ecf6e88)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Company data](https://preview.redd.it/hngcefohs2161.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35eb4e3ea21cc060dca0a7bc65556c40e1647ca6)\n\n \n\nThe revenue growth is impressive, with Q3 growth at 52% y/y and full  year 2020 revenue expected to be 44% year-over-year. However, is this  revenue growth sustainable? **There are signs of lower confidence in growth**  \u2013 mainly customer count going down from 133 at the end of 2019 to 131  at the end of Q3, weak headcount increase of +2-3% y/y in FY21, and  operating expense decreasing 28% y/y which is a huge number and unusual  for a company in high growth mode.\n\n**Palantir\u2019s Business Model:** PLTR goes to market with a  direct sales force, with heavy involvement from senior management in  the early stages. Sales cycles can be long, with heavy implementation  services required to get customers running. Sale engineering and pricing  vary on the scope and scale of the project. PLTR\u2019s business model has  three phases: Acquire, Expand, and Scale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Company Q3 presentation](https://preview.redd.it/ircmb18ts2161.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=323cabade8b9de9f729a53bfa1fd12db81813be2)\n\nAcquire \u2013 PLTR offers short-term pilot deployments of their software  at little to no cost to attract new customers and further monetize  existing ones. These pilots lead to initial losses. Customers in the  Acquire phase are defined as customers who contribute less than $100k in  revenue in a calendar year. \n\nExpand \u2013 This is the phase where PLTR would begin to see an  inflection in revenue and margin. Customers in this phase are defined as  those generating more than $100k in revenue in a calendar year, while  having negative contribution margin throughout the same period. \n\nScale \u2013 With 95% of revenue coming from existing customers, the  company\u2019s ability to scale within its base is crucial for its growth  strategy. Palantir\u2019s system is very sticky, once the software is  installed and configured, the customer can develop further apps and  software to use on top of the platform, contributing to further usage.\n\n**Total Addressable Market** (**TAM) opportunity:** Palantir  estimates their TAM to be $120bn based on their bottoms-up analysis on  customer spending levels across the commercial and government sectors. \n\nCompany management believes the core product is applicable to  commercial customers with more than $500mm in revenue, roughly 6,000  commercial companies. The management estimated commercial TAM of $56bn,  implying $9mm per commercial customer. This sort of TAM calculation  signifies PLTR has penetrated less than 1% of their potential commercial market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: our estimates, company estimates](https://preview.redd.it/9zd99daws2161.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b543896f77f55f1cc3e3c82be6f3beca58dbbcbc)\n\nFor government customers, management estimated a $63bn TAM based on  their assumptions around software and consulting services penetration of  US and US allied governments. We estimate spend based on Gartner FY24  IT spend estimates. This sort of TAM calculation signifies PLTR has penetrated once again less than 1% of their potential government market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: our estimates, company estimates](https://preview.redd.it/dxbndfxys2161.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bce1a47f32cda8adb9a74854f7c9b32dadf98af1)\n\nSell-side estimates vary from $55bn at Citi, who utilized a top-down  methodology, and $105bn at Goldman based on similar methodology to  Palantir\u2019s estimates. Regardless of methodology, these sort of TAM  levels imply **PLTR has penetrated less than 0.8% \u2013 1.8% of their total market opportunity.** Clearly, there is room to run if management is able to execute effectively and grab more market share.\n\n**Government services:** Recent strength in the  government segment was primarily due to the results of a recent lawsuit \u2013  specifically a lawsuit in 2016 against the US Army that allowed the  army to consider commercially available products instead of using  strictly custom built software solutions. In 1H20, the US Army  represented 31% of total government revenue vs 16% in FY 2019. While  PLTR has worked with other government agencies such as the Dept of  Defense, US FDA, CDC, and NIH, there is still a large customer  concentration within the US Army. While PLTR has signaled its attempts  to broaden into other western-allied governments, it is unclear how much  traction, if any, the company has outside the US government. Some  government customers have begun to expand into commercially focused  product such as Foundry, which is a positive theme for future  cross-selling opportunities.\n\nGovernment contract backlog provides some visibility into future  revenue, at least more visibility when compared to the commercial  segment. PLTR has indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)  government contracts totaling $2.6bn as of 2Q 2020. These are awarded  contracts, but the funding has yet to be determined and is not  guaranteed. With little certainty surrounding funding and timing, these  contracts represent potential upside to our estimates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9i0a4a1t2161.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f07f9fb6ee9224b06f32347b8c5545038ef3896e\n\n**Commercial services:** In 2016, Palantir launched its  Foundry platform \u2013 a centralized data OS for commercial customers.  Customers can leverage the platform to manage, filter, and visualize  large datasets. Sustainable growth in the commercial segment will hinge  on efforts to broaden use cases and leveraging sales reps to drive top  line growth.\n\nWith ARPC at $5.8mn as of the last 9 months of 2020, PLTR has a  meaningful opportunity to expand via new use workflows and growth in  users. Sales cycles and implementation times can be long given PLTR\u2019s  complexity, but once commercial orgs see and realize the value, spending  growth can grow at a rapid rate. It is critical that PLTR reduce sales  times and becomes more efficient in implementation in order to diversify  its customer base as its largest commercial customer represents greater  than 20% of total commercial revenue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8jlnnc3t2161.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3275a383450ac8822c322fe5d00da3369b94ddfe\n\nWhile the company has expanded into various industries and use cases  over the last several years, its customer count remains among the lowest  in growth software \u2013 131 (including government entities). Today,  product market fit remains narrow and tailored to specific scenarios or  one-off situations (table below). The use cases also tend to be  concentrated around a few industries such as energy, transportation,  financial services, and healthcare. Near-term visibility in the  commercial segment remains low and hinges entirely on the execution and  size of a few contracts per quarter and year. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5h7ycrw4t2161.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35cf55a824c910ae8ffb748559926c05697d09ff\n\n**Quarterly Earnings recap:** Palantir put up a strong  3rd quarter in its first quarter as a public company. There was ongoing  momentum for the government business, as revenue growth accelerated from  56% last quarter to 68%. Most impressive, the commercial business grew  35% y/y, up from 17% in 2019. Total revenue growth accelerated to 52%  y/y, up from 43% last quarter. \n\nThe company also announced efforts to modularize (flexibility around  the full-stack solution) its Foundry product and to accelerate the pace  of app development, efforts which will help drive broader product market  fit in the commercial segment and drive more sales. We like these  solutions as it shows Palantir is adapting to the needs of its customers  in order to gain more customers. The full-stack or perhaps a  not-so-full-but-fuller-stack solution capability can be expanded once a  customer is up and running on Foundry. These sorts of efforts will be  crucial in diversifying the customer base.\n\nAdjusted operating margins improved and were a positive 25%, up from  -49% a year ago. This healthy margin expansion was primarily due to  greater efficiencies in acquiring and scaling customers. We expect PLTR  to generate further operating leverage with a more experienced sales  force and account management teams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2adbam6t2161.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7157552fda8339bf2da1aa7fa05ab76e027119fd\n\n**PLTR Comparables Trading Multiples:** Shares are  currently trading 28x/21.3x CY20/CY21 sales estimates. Post-IPO PLTR was  trading at a discount to peers, now it is trading at a premium.  \n\n[This was post-IPO and no longer relevant](https://preview.redd.it/zvcvqy7at2161.png?width=871&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17814d0426eff732ccde8e905a09c87a58ccfc5f)\n\n For core comparable companies, we use software companies with high  growth estimates. For the broader comparable companies, we use a wider  range of software companies. High growth software companies are  currently trading at an average of 18.5x 2021 sales and the broader  comparables market is trading at 18.8x 2021 sales (largely due to  Snowflake). Palantir is currently trading at 21.3x 2021 sales. Across  every EV / Sales metric for the next 3 years, PLTR is trading at a  significant premium over the core comparables, the wider broad  comparables, and the total of both trading multiples.\n\nHowever, this premium can be justified, because as we can see **PLTR\u2019s forecasted revenue growth is higher than the comparables estimates**. However, **PLTR also has higher customer concentration and lower revenue visibility** than most of the comparable companies, so this premium is especially risky at current valuation levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Bloomberg consensus estimates](https://preview.redd.it/bj7ymy0dt2161.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=112c1731a3ca94897cbc4a396eb939cecbb0d0fa)\n\n These two factors combined: customer concentration + lack of  revenue  visibility (negative) and higher forecasted revenues (positive), does  the stock deserve its premium?\n\n**Valuation:** We use an Enterprise Value / Free Cash  Flow valuation for this company. We get a $20 target price which is  based on 37.5x EV/FCF multiple on 2025E Free Cash Flow of $1.165bn. We  also get $4.44 bn in 2025e revenues. For reference, MS uses a 40x 2025e  FCF, Citi 35x 2026e FCF, and GS uses a combined DCF and 13.0x revenue  model.\n\nWe lay out a range of Bear/Base/Bull cases with the main drivers of the valuation and our Base Case assumptions being:\n\n* Number of **net** customer adds \u2013 5 per year from current 131 customers to 234 customers in 2025\n* Avg.  Revenue per Customer growth \u2013 18.8% CAGR in avg. revenue per customer.  From estimated $8mm/cust in 2020 to $19mm/cust in 2025e\n* Gross Margin % \u2013 a hefty 82% vs 81% last quarter\n* Opex Margin % \u2013 a hefty 45% vs 44% last quarter\n* Capital Expenditures \u2013 continuation of historical very low levels, tech cos usually have low capex\n* Free  Cash Flow Multiple \u2013 37.5x which is consistent with other high growth  software data / analytics companies and between the Citi and MS  multiples\n\n[Source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/qslg362gt2161.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6db3e44a12e60e36a8daf4a9f279a6f97286cfa1)\n\n For purposes of establishing a trading range for the stock, here is a  grid of 2025e revenue scenarios given total customer count and ARPC CAGR. As you can see, the amount of revenue PLTR is able to squeeze from  customers has a very large effect on the calculation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/1nk201fjt2161.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74bbdca6264611efa69c1a89eac19d975ba6331e)\n\n Then, depending on each of these future revenue scenarios, based on  different free cash flow margins and valuation multiples, we get a range  of stock prices. As you can see, for purposes of our Base Case, the FCF  margin is 26.2%. The multiple and the cash flow margin have an equally  large effect, with every 1.5x in the multiple adding \\~$3 to the stock  price in the middle range, and every 2.5% in FCF margin similarly adds  \\~$3. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/jvkide9lt2161.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02aaa64d9da5a2970c1f61ce812ac0c279a57900)\n\n**Key Risks:** Simply put, there are a lot of unknowns  with this company. This is one of the most binary companies I have come  across, it will either be a massive hit or a dud and I attempt to value  it accordingly. This binary opportunity is primarily because of limited  visibility into this company\u2019s sales. Palantir targets large-scale  opportunities within large governments and commercial entities. These  projects have high costs, long sales cycles, and are incredibly complex.  **A quarter\u2019s earnings hit or miss and yearly growth can depend on a few contracts.** \n\nCustomer concentration and a small base is another risk. Although  PLTR has made some progress and decreased their total revenue  attributable to the largest 20 customers from 68% the first 9 months of  2019, to 61% the first 9 months of 2020, **PLTR has the highest customer concentration among public growth software providers.** A significant decrease in revenue from a top customer can have an adversely large impact on the company.\n\nCompetition is significant. PLTR\u2019s full-stack approach may be  abrasive and put it at odds with other tech vendors in the data /  analytics space. Some organizations may see a relationship with PLTR as  too limiting and would prefer more flexibility to use some of the best  of breed tools from other software companies outside of PLTR.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdhx3qjnt2161.png?width=841&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=383eb28700926383110bb0a76edc3f9d021dbced\n\nRecent and near-term expected hiring doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in  significant growth. Palantir expects to only grow headcount 4% in FY20  and operating expenses have notably declined, with guidance continuing  this decline. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t95bqxxot2161.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d1bc01dd969fd556d3413d69c3934a76592f62d\n\nPalantir is not a young company, it was founded in 2003. Although PLTR  is now hitting it\u2019s stride and making significant progress and growth,  the company has historically generated operating losses and negative  cash flow. This also ties in with the lack of detailed disclosures from  the company. In its S-1 (IPO filing) the company provided 6 historical  quarters, but only included the income statement. Without more  information, it is difficult to understand or predict the seasonality of  the business appropriately. \n\n**Key catalysts:**\n\nIncreased commercial adoption is a massive catalyst for PLTR. If the  company is able to improve adoption by introducing more flexible  workflow solutions that meet a larger segment of the commercial market,  the addressable market opportunity is incredible and can be swift. In  addition, improving sales efficiency could drive higher profitability  than we have currently modeled.\n\nThe company is currently profitable with 25% adjusted operating  margins in Q3 2020. Management highlights the release of Apollo, the  continuous delivery software that powers the Foundry and Gotham  platforms, as the main driver in these efficiency gains. The  efficiencies generated by Apollo and more \u2018productized\u2019 offering have  resulted a lowered average implementation time and decrease in the days  it takes to ERP integration going.\n\n**TLDR;** Company is impossible to predict and is a completely binary play. Currently offers full-stack solution and I believe the future growth of company in the commercial sector will depend on being more flexible with its core products and meeting more use cases. Government is a hard read and any contract momentum outside of US aren't clear.

If NIO beats expectations tonight on EC, will this push it even higher in the short run, or will we see prices fall in the after hours? \n\nPersonally, I speculated a dip after EC tn even if the news is all positive due to the massive amounts of attention this stock is getting right now, and the rally we have seen this week and today.

        "selftext": "  \n\nI have been seeing a lot of confusion and or flat out wrong information about THBC/Microvast so I thought I'd make this post to make everything more clear and with proof.\n\nIt's best to present this as who is who, and what it what.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Tuscan Holdings Corp\\*\\*\n\nTuscan Holdings Corp is a blank check company that has two listings on the NASDAQ. Tickers THCB and THCA, both are reserved for future mergers. Each have their own private investors and IPOs to raise money. THCB which is involved with the Microvast merger raised $240 Million and THCA raised $172 Million. These blank check companies originally were seeking weed targets (hence \u201cTHC\u201d A/B). In saying that, you can see all the people that have invested after the 11/13 announcement here\n\n[https://fintel.io/so/us/thcb](https://fintel.io/so/us/thcb)\n\nGreen flags: \n\nInstitutional investors both big and small. Entry prices close to mine. \n\nRed flags:\n\nNone (but see shares/warrant info)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*EarlyBirdCapital\\*\\*\n\nEarlyBirdCapital is the investment bank that underwrote the original IPO and are involved in the merger process. The last 4 mergers they were involved in was \n\nTTCF (up 60%)\n\nVLDR (up 70%)\n\nAVCT (down 50%)\n\nBWMX (up 75%)\n\nThis was important to mention because the structuring around all these SPACS are fairly similar, but some are more \u201cpredatory\u201d than others. E.g. for a short time, VLDR had some bag holders due to a PIPE dilution being in the original structure that people overlooked. \n\n[http://earlybirdcapital.com/spac-transactions/completed-spac-mergers](http://earlybirdcapital.com/spac-transactions/completed-spac-mergers)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Microvast\\*\\*\n\nMicrovast is the intended target. They are an EV Battery company specializing in fast charging. They do not have publicly available financial records. The business does have real products and real people working there. I took the time out to find alleged Microvast (linkedin) workers and find their MS/PhD thesis, publications, etc. The American HQ in Texas is fake. It looks nothing like the building on their website in streetview. It's nothing more than an office. It feels like the equivalent of when \\[Chinese companies hire White \u201cCEOs\u201d\\]( [https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2096341/white-people-wanted-peek-chinas-booming-rent-foreigner-industry](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2096341/white-people-wanted-peek-chinas-booming-rent-foreigner-industry)). There was an unprofessional non-response when I tried to call in. They have another site in Germany which seems more real. But in general, this is a 100% Chinese operation, which has some cultural related risks.\n\nThere have been some talks about the merger having a high chance of failure, but I do not see that here. The whole point of SPACs is to get insider investors in and out, with a 1- or 2-year deadline to find a company to merge with. Looking for a weed stock, it is obvious that the original private investors are looking for a cash grab through what is hot, and anything EV is hot right now. They are running out of time and Microvast fills that hot market requirement. As for Microvast they too benefit from \u201cIPOing\u201d in such a hot market. \n\nhere is some battery news\n\n[https://www.idtechex.com/en/timeline/microvast-inc/c96938](https://www.idtechex.com/en/timeline/microvast-inc/c96938)\n\nhttp://www.microvast.com/upload/2019/01/24/15483851211001fdvlf.pdf\n\nhttps://www.masstransitmag.com/home/article/12291796/bus-electrification-choosing-the-right-charging-method\n\nhttps://www.electrive.com/2020/07/03/microvast-completes-battery-factory-in-brandenburg/\n\n[https://www.electrive.com/2020/10/14/microvast-presents-fast-charging-pouch-cell/](https://www.electrive.com/2020/10/14/microvast-presents-fast-charging-pouch-cell/)\n\nGreen flags: \n\nNon-Chinese customers\n\nAmerican/European Contracts\n\nReal products with real-world usage for years, no downhill trucks in neutral. \n\nActive development\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRed flags:\n\nSketchy North American \u201cHQ\u201d presence \n\npotential increased risk from it being a Chinese business with little recourse from American investors. \n\nUnknown financials\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Common Stock and Warrant detail, How it all comes together\\*\\*\n\nIf you buy the THCB warrants, you straight up do in fact lose ALL of your money, if the merger fails. The deadline for THCB is Dec-6. This is NOT a hard deadline. IMHO the worst-case scenario in this hot EV market is the SPAC gets a deadline extension, which must be approved within 24hrs. All of this is in the 14A documents linked below. Right now the warrants are 1:1 and trade at $1.80. it means that for every $1.80 you spend on a single warrant you have the rights to buy a single THBC common stock. This is a \"good\" ratio as warrants can be as high as 4-6 warrants per stock. These warrants are saying for each warrant you can buy THCB stock post-merger for $11.50. If the stock reaches over $18 and stays that way for over 20 days THCB/Microvast has the right to redeem all the warrants you have for literally a penny each, a 99%+ lose. \\*\\*However\\*\\*, that's only if you don't have the cash to exercise the warrant. For example if you spent $2000 buying 1000 warrants. You need to have ($11.50 \\* 1000 = $11.5k) in 30 days or you are SOL. This may be attractive to some people because you only spent $2k in the short term to make ($18 \\* 1000 - $11.50 \\* 1000) = $6.5k (over 300% gain vs 50% gainn buying shares)\n\nIf you are in common stock you are on a safer \"investment\" as the worst case scenario is that the merger fails. In this scenario all the insider shareholders are barred from participating in liquidation. Liquidation is public and through THCB buying 100% of all shares at market value from a $280 million + interest trust fund that has enough money to buy all outstanding shares for $10 a share. In other words, you aren't selling to prevent a 100% loss you are selling to prevent a loss down to available funding. However, this is explicitly not guaranteed. If for some reason THCB were to be sued or faced bankruptcy or had some other debt obligation it would have to come out the trust. The implied risk for me is that that it should be no less than $9-10. \n\nGreen flags:\n\nNo indication of PIPE upon merger\n\nHolding $10 minimum value\n\nRed flags:\n\nFast approaching deadline \n\nSources: \n\n&gt; \u201cIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination by 21 months from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe holders of shares of common stock issued prior to the IPO (\u201cinsider shares\u201d) have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the 6,900,000 insider shares and the 558,589 shares of common stock underlying the units purchased in a private placement simultaneously with the IPO (such shares, the \u201cprivate placement shares\u201d). Additionally, the holders of an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common stock (the \u201crepresentative shares\u201d) and 128,411 private placement shares issued to EarlyBird Capital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters in the IPO, and its designees have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to such shares. As a consequence of such waivers, a liquidating distribution will be made only with respect to the public shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to the Company\u2019s warrants, which will expire worthless in the event we wind up.\u201d\n\nSo that's about it. There is something to be said about dilution. These SPACs, and emerging companies are in the business of making money. Before SPACs became hot the money to be made was with the warrants. Holding them until merger or expiring worthless. The risk being that a lot of SPACs would fail to merge. After merging everything is a free game as for how the business wants to increase funding. NKLA was a scam product hence they diluted as soon as possible. VLDR diluted but they told people about it in the original documentation. There has been no indication in the THCB documentation that they will dilute. Since they have a real product it will be smarter for them to take the NIO, XPENG, etc. route and hold off while the market is hot.\n\nDirect fillings \n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1760689/000121390019003643/f424b40319\\_tuscan.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1760689/000121390019003643/f424b40319_tuscan.htm)\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1760689/000121390020034230/ea129161-pre14a\\_tuscanhold.htm",
