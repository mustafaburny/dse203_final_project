        "selftext": "Hey guys, first time posting here. I\u2019m a student and for one of my classes we have to perform ratio, strategy, and accounting analysis on a company given to us. So I\u2019ve spent the last week combing a decade of CBB\u2019s previous 10k\u2019s, reading any news article I could get my hands on, recasting, and doing SWOT and Porters Five analyses on CBB. \n\nNeedless to say I think I know more about them than any other redditor on here (not true, but the lack of sleep and copious amounts of adderall tell me I\u2019m right). I can say that this telecommunications company is headed nowhere fast. \n\nFor one, they have an accumulated deficit of ($140 million) on their balance sheet that management seems to not give a shit about, as it\u2019s been increasing steadily since at least 2011. They lag way behind the industry in liquidity (current ratio of .74) and haven\u2019t turned a profit since 2017. They have a jaw dropping amount of debt (~2 billion), but I can\u2019t even compute a D/E ratio because of their accumulated deficit. \n\nROA? About .3 behind the rest of the industry. Asset Turnover? Not much better. Verizon accounts for almost a quarter of CBBs receivables as well, so fingers crossed nothing bad happens to one of their biggest competitors.\n\nBut the whopper is their interest coverage ratio. ITS .6. Their EBIT only covers 60% of their debt each year. Unless I\u2019m missing something, this is a recipe for perpetual debt and eventually bankruptcy. \n\nApart from the numbers, they\u2019ve put all (or most) of the geographical eggs in one basket. They service a depressed part of a rust belt state that people are leaving in droves. They did acquire Hawaiian Telecom in 2018. Not that the revenue from that acquisition has exceeded the costs of integration yet. Hurray for another 1 million potential customers I guess. (Not mentioning that a single F5 or typhoon could wipe out half their infrastructure.)\n\nCompetitors? One of them is probably providing the data allowing you to read this post. They\u2019re big, can spend wayyyyy more on PP &amp; E, and have wireless divisions, unlike CBB.\n\nCredit where it\u2019s due: CBB honestly made a valiant effort to get into the fiber optics game back In the 2000s but it was too little too late; there\u2019s no way they can compete with Google, AT&amp;T, and Verizon\u2019s expenditures on fiber cable. \n\nOne more thing guys: \n\nCBB earns a fifth of its revenue from landline services. If you\u2019re wondering if that\u2019s a good thing or not try to remember the last time you used a god damn landline.\n\nI could continue to trash Cincy Bell for a few thousand more words but I\u2019m tired and want to smoke a bowl and hit the sack. If u want a full report email my professor lol. If I haven\u2019t convinced you yet then you\u2019re either a h8er or are smarter than me, in which case buy that shit and pm me a few years from now to let me know how it went.\n\nTL;DR: grab your landline, call your broker, tell him to sell your CBB.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 10, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily today, with market participants taking a breather after an initial wave of optimism over a potential coronavirus vaccine. Shares of tech companies remain under pressure, with the Nasdaq underperforming the other two major indices.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.79% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.14% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) outperformed, finishing 0.93% up.\n\nYesterday, Pfizer\u2019s (PFE) and BioNTech\u2019s (BNTX) announced that the vaccine candidate was 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 in patients participating in the clinical trial. The news fueled a market rally yesterday, with the SPY and DIA reaching intraday records. However, since the record-highs, both indices have pared gains. Stuart Kaiser, UBS Head of Equity Deritavtives Research, said, \u201cI think the big surprise was the efficacy. I think you had polled investors before this, the efficacy range would have been 50-75% as sort of a wide range. And if this number is truly 90% or above, I think that is what the market is responding so positively to.\u201d\n\nIn other positive from the medical sector, Eli Lilly (LLY) announced it received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its antibody therapy used to treat moderate to severe cases of COVID-19. This comes a few weeks after regeneron, a drug produced by Gildead (GILD) that also treats moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 was approved by the FDA. \n\nA successful vaccine is seen by market participants as a necessary component for safe, sustained, and broad economic reopening. According to Yahoo Finance, an estimate 27 million workers, around 22% of the workforce, work in close physical proximity with others. In order to safely and fully reopen the economy and return to some semblance of normalcy, a vaccine is a key component.\n\nStill, despite the good news, it is important to note that widespread distribution of the vaccine may took months, after approval is granted. To produce enough doses and distribute them globally will be a massive, logistical undertaking, one that will take some time to put in place. Some analysts have cautioned to extrapolating positive vaccine data to thinking distribution is just around the corner. Carter Henderson, portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital, said \u201c\u201cThe vaccine news is really a 2021 story and we still have the worst to deal with COVID, as cases run at new highs. So the vaccine is not an immediate fix. That\u2019s why we believe stimulus is still on the table. So if we get news about stimulus early in next year coupled with vaccine news, we think the market could have a true melt-up.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tech stocks, which have broadly outperformed the market since March, did not participate in yesterday\u2019s rally, with the pullback accelerating during today\u2019s session. \n* Shares of cruise lines, airlines and hotel companies, and other reopening stocks that would greatly benefit from a vaccine, gave back some gains after surging higher yesterday.\n* Apple (AAPL) just announced its first homemade chip for the Mac, the M1. The company also introduced three new Macs powered by the chip.\n* Beyond Meat (BYND) is reportedly working with Pizza Hut (YUM) to developed plant-based Italian sausages. The stock is around 20% down  today after McDonald\u2019s announced its own brand of plant-based meat alternatives.\n* The European Union filed antitrust charges against Amazon (AMZN) over the company\u2019s use of data.\n* Atara BioTherapeutics with target increase by HAC Wainwright to $28 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $14.\n* F5 Networks (FFIV) with target raised by Piper Sandler from $170 to $177 OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $155\n* McDonald's (MCD) with two target increases. Stock currently around $213.\n   * Credit Suisse at $230 OUTPERFORM\n   * Keycorp at $235 OVERWEIGHT\n* Pfizer (PFE) with target increase by Mizuho at $44 BUY. Stock currently around $39 after positive vaccine data yesterday.\n* Plug Power (PLUG) with several bullish target increases. Stock currently around $20.\n   * HC Wainwright at #30 BUY\n   * B. Riley at $24 BUY.\n* LiveRamp (RAMP) target increase by Needham &amp; Co. to $85 at BUY. This is one we like and recommended months ago. Stock took big tumble today, down more than 15%.\n* Uniti Group (UNIT) with target increase from Raymond James at $16 rated BUY. Stock currently around $9.5.\n* Sprout Social (SPT) with two, bullish increases. Stock currently around $44.\n   * Needham &amp; Co. from $46 to $52 BUY\n   * Keycorp from $33 to $55 OVERWEIGHT\n* Jumia (JMIA) falls more than 20% after earnings after the company posted a decline in revenue.  The gross merchandise value fell 28% year-over-year in the Q3. Gross profit was up 22% year-over-year in the third quarter and the operating loss declined 49% year-over-year.\n\n\"Be fearful when others are greedy.

Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads have long used Apple-designed processors, which the company says helps extend battery life and provide faster performance.\n\nApple could launch a iMac desktop with a new design and laptops using Apple chips, according to a research note from TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo published earlier this year.\n\nMac sales have been a highlight for Apple during the pandemic. In the quarter ending in June, Apple reported $9 billion in Mac sales, which was up 28% year-over-year.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/02/apple-announces-event-for-nov-10-where-new-macs-with-apple-chips-expected.html)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020**\n\nStocks opened today\u2019s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.\n\nAfter an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.\n\nOn Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus \n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until \u201cat least 2023\u201d. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed\u2019s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, \u201ctoo little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.\n\nThe US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. \n\nLast week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it\u2019s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using. Could impact Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which owns ARM chips, and Intel, who has not been doing very well lately, judging from last earnings report and stock price action (INTC).\n* Images for the updated Tesla Cybertruck could come next Musk, according to CEO Elon Musk.\n* Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader!\n* Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles\u2019 Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles\u2019 Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Single\u2019s day is a counter to Valentine\u2019s Day that celebrates being single. Normally it\u2019s held on Nov 11. This is the world\u2019s largest shopping festival. According to Fortune Magazine, BABA shipped $38.4 billion in gross merchandise value on Singles\u2019 Day last year. Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, by comparison, sold around $6 billion in goods last year.\n* Asian shares were mostly higher on Monday buoyed by further signs of recovery in China's manufacturing sector. The Caixin manufacturing PMI, a major indicator for China's manufacturing sector, rose in October, showing that domestic demand is holding up, reports said over the weekend.\n* Allegiant Travel (ALGT) upgraded by Morgan Stanley (MS) to $175 OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $131\n* Alibaba (BABA) target raised by Keycorp from $330 to $350 OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $310\n* ChampionX (CHX) target raised by Barclays from $16 to $19 OUTPERFORM. Notable because stock currently around $9\n* Carvana (CVNA) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $215 to $225.

Stock currently around $75.\n* Alphabet (GOOG, $GOOGL) target rasied by Argus from $1620 to $1850 at BUY. Stock currently around $1650.\n* Cloudfare (NET) target raised by two notable institutions. Stock currently around $53.\n   * Royal Bank of Canada frm $50 to $55 OUTPERFROM \n   * Oppenheimer from $55 to $65 OUTPERFORM \n* Peleton (PTON) target raised by Needham from $110 to $125 at BUY. Stock currently around $115. \n* Paypal (PYPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $210 to $229 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $192.\n* Solaredge (SEDG) with massive target increase by Roth Capital from $191 to $300 at BUY. Stock currently around $266.\n* Vipshop (VIPS) target raised by Keycorp from $22 to $24 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $21.

I am ahead of my return schedule and have limited incentive to take unnecessary risk. \n\nI'm also looking to build out my veteran one on one schedule for November so if you are or know any veterans that would be interested in a 45min one on one session with me, drop me a line in the GForm below. If there's anything that anyone would like to see me cover, drop it in the GForm below. \n\nHow did everyone else make out in October? What would you have done differently? \n\nVideo review: [https://youtu.be/BYCZklqdMHg](https://youtu.be/BYCZklqdMHg)  \nGForm (no personal info required): [https://forms.gle/Ge5tEgzKjmfYj3SUA](https://forms.gle/Ge5tEgzKjmfYj3SUA)\n\n\\-Erik",
