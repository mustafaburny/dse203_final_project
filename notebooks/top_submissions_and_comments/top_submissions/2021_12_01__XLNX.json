New play AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su (long live Dr Su) said during latest earnings call AMD is going close its acquisition of Xilinx. Every shareholder of Xilinx will get 1.72 shares of AMD for their 1 share of XLNX. Today the market has 14% discount on this but it is converging. \n\nIf you like AMD buy Xilinx today and when merger closes by end of month boom you just got a Black Friday sale AMD stock.\n\nIf you\u2019re a true degenerate you\u2019ll buy some 0 DTE crap that will expire worthless.",
