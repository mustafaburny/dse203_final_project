Those that listened to me, grats.

However, they're not able to get to that point because AMD is up so much. Which means they have to close AMD short positions now and sell Xilinx to cover the costs. At least, that's what it seems is happening based on the charts. This is great for us AMD holders because it's driving the price higher. But I just wanted to impart some wrinkles on your smooth brain.\n\nPositions: 300 Shares of AMD with various call options expiring from now through next year.",

        "selftext": "# TLDR: If you like free money - buy XLNX and wait.\n\nFor context, AMD announced Xilinx acquisition in october last year: [https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing)\n\nThe acquisition is an all-stock deal, which means for every Xilinx stock you will get exactly 1.7234 of AMD stock after the merger is completed. The merger is planned to be completed by the end of the year, and it has been reiterated during 2 of the previous earning calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What is there to gain?\n\nAMD stock is trading today at $112. Xilinx today is trading at $146. This means a ratio of 1.30 instead of 1.7234. Buying Xilinx you are buying AMD stocks for $85 after merger happens. This is 30% upside of free monies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What is there to lose?\n\nIf AMD/XILINX deal doesn't go through, XLNX will most likely jump straight back to pre-merger announcement territory, it will probably end up around $110-$115.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What could stop the merger from happening?\n\nThere are several regulators that have to approve merger. Most of the important ones already did:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory\\_approval\\_status](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory_approval_status)\n\nHowever it hasn't been approved by China yet: [https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/07/01/with-approvals-in-from-the-ec-and-the-uk-amds-35b-acquisition-of-xilinx-now-up-to-china/](https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/07/01/with-approvals-in-from-the-ec-and-the-uk-amds-35b-acquisition-of-xilinx-now-up-to-china/)\n\nThe moment China approves the deal, Xilinx stock will jump very close to 1.7234 multiple of AMD (and possibly drag AMD down a bit, however merger approval is *good news* for AMD as well).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What are the chances China does not approve of the deal?\n\nOf course it's a gamble with high US-China tensions, but let's take a look at some facts. In 2019 Chinese antitrust committee reviewed 465 deals. It approved all of them (!!).\n\n[https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1421064d-d8f4-4591-963c-d0d65999ff57](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1421064d-d8f4-4591-963c-d0d65999ff57)\n\nIn 2020 they reviewed 458 deals. Out of all of them, they rejected a single one (DouYu merger with Huya, both Chinese companies).\n\n[https://www.gibsondunn.com/antitrust-in-china-2020-year-in-review/](https://www.gibsondunn.com/antitrust-in-china-2020-year-in-review/)\n\nThis means only one rejection out of 923 deals!\n\nNvidia purchased Mellanox in 2020 and it was conditionally approved through China. This is equivalent of AMD/XLNX deal. AMD owns ATI, which was started by Chinese Canadians. Both Xilinx and AMD are US based. They already have heavy business connections with China. I'm not bold enough to estimate the odds, but the facts suggest they're quite high!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# If this is such a good deal, why is nobody else buying XLNX?\n\nThey were, but had to cover their shorts! The most common way to play XLNX/AMD merger is to go short AMD and long XLNX, and that's what most investors did. However, with recent magnificient AMD run up after Q2 earnings call they were forced to cover their short positions as they became too expensive to hold till the merger. And I have proof that prices were closely correlated until very recently, let's take a look at this XLNX/AMD ratio graph: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\\_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio)\n\nUp until very recently the deal was oscilating within 1.5-1.6 area and after recent AMD run up it's been lagging strongly behind. Unless there's some hidden factor major investors know about but not common folks, this is literally the best time in history to buy XLNX to convert into AMD after the merger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: XLNX leaps, XLNX stock, AMD stock",

        "selftext": "AMD has had an incredible run these past few days, following their phenomenal earnings. The question is: how much more can it go? Well, I put together some quick numbers and it seems it is still very cheap. I focused on Market Cap / Turnover, which is a ratio that I personally like a lot.\n\n\tNVDA\n\n|Year|Turnover|Growth|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2018|11,716||\n|2019|10,918|\\-6.8%|\n|2020|16,675|52.7%|\n|TTM|19,256|15.5%|\n|2018-Today||64.36%|\n|Market Cap|492B||\n|MC / TO|25.6||\n\n\t\n\nAMD\n\n|Year|Turnover|Growth|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2018|6,475||\n|2019|6,731|3.9%|\n|2020|9,763|45%|\n|TTM|13,340|36.6|\n|2018-Today||106%|\n|Market Cap|132B||\n|MC / TO|9.9||\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see above, MC/TO ratio on NVDIA is almost 3x higher than on AMD despite AMD having higher recent growth. It is obvious that this is not the only ratio that matters and other factors come into play when pricing a stock, but AMD is an incredible growth stock and I strongly believe it will keep crushing on Turnover and closing the MC/TO gap to NVDA. Even a small increase from 9.9 to 12 would mean an additional 20% in stock price assuming current Turnover, which will be history very soon given the rapid growth.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that NVDA is up 45% in the past 6 months vs 28% for AMD and this is mostly due to the XLNX acquisition, which brought concerns to investors. Recent numbers from XLNX have given some comfort to the market.\n\nTL/DR: AMD still cheap. I see $150 in the horizon.",

And I love AMD, I wanna make love with Lisa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart I. \n\nSO WHY BUY AMD WITH CAUTION?  \n\n\nAMD has recently reached a RSI of 80%++,  \nAnd what does RSI even mean?  \n\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) is a [momentum indicator](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/momentum-and-relative-strength-index/) used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100. The indicator was originally developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.\u201d\n\nTraditional interpretation and usage of the RSI are that values of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought or overvalued and may be primed for a trend [reversal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversal.asp) or corrective [pullback](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pullback.asp) in price. An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold or [undervalued](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp) condition.\n\nFrom technical analysis of AMD's 1 Year Graph we can compare between the RSI of the stock with the Stock Value over time to determine how the RSI of AMD affects its share value.\n\nRSI of AMD over time :  \n\n\n[AMD's RSI](https://preview.redd.it/ko8x5dbc9af71.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=214a0c09fcbaa5d370cc26c6d8aef315de2d94a5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMD's Stock Value](https://preview.redd.it/akovqqdf9af71.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7ad01c494e55a90bb1e14204f94f1e12298dc26)\n\nNotice how the RSI of AMD is replicative to the stock value itself?  \nWith the RSI reaching ATH's again it is detrimental to note that a rebound will come soon just a matter of when.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart II.\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID OF THE XILINX MERGER MORE THAN NOT.\n\nThe acquisition of XILINX by AMD costs a whopping $35,000,000,000.  \nAre they paying in cash? No  \nAre they paying in stocks? Fuck Yes.  \n\n\nSo what the fuck does that mean for the stock?  \nOnce the acquisition is complete by AMD over XILINX...  \nThere will be a share dilution of 35B$ worth of AMC shares in the open market  \nMeaning the market will have an influx of 35B worth of AMC shares from new AMD share owners.  \nAnd what does that mean for YOUR AMD shares? Go figure\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart III.\n\nBEING AN AMD BAGHOLDER.\n\nGod I fucking love this stock and Lisa, I needa marry her right tf now and spawn 3 baby apes with her naming them Andy Matthew Donkey.\n\nBut in all realism, I sense the impending pullback that \\*ALWAYS\\* occur with AMD.  \nIt might hit $120 before rebounding, it might rebound tomorrow. Almost every pre-market ever has nearly been in the red, this is a strong indicative sign that the market itself is already going against the bulls, most of y'all with your $HOOD accounts can barely sell/buy during pre-market anyways. \n\nTo end it all off, I love AMD but I can't stress how overbought and insane the value of the stock is right now. It went from 90B to 135B over an insane quarterly report, I personally believe they're trying to bump the stock to insane levels now so that the acquisition for XILINX will be easier on AMD's stock and once that pump and dump is over, I strongly believe AMD's value will tank with the 35B influx of stock into the market.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I just love the stock. \n\nGodspeed apes \ud83e\udd8d",

        "selftext": "Okay ladies and apes. I've been doing some serious thinking on the back of this massive AMD rally... \n\nXLNX call options are currently 50% under priced. \n\nI'm trying to do some quick maths here to figure out if XLNX leaps make sense. It seems a little too good to be true. I'll have to call the options clearing corp again on Monday to make sure my math checks out.\n\n[infomemo.theocc.com/...](https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=48452)\n\nIf I have interpreted the above link correctly from options clearing corp. If I purchased a XLNX call option, and the merger goes through. Let's say a 160 strike price XLNX call. Upon merging, the XLNX call option would be converted to an AMD1 non-standard call option worth 172 shares, but with a strike price of $92.\n\nCurrent price of March 2022 AMD $92 call is $22.95  \nCurrent price of March 2022 XLNX $160 call is $17.75\n\nThe XLNX call not only costs less, but is worth 172 shares instead of 100. That same AMD Call should cost $39 if it was worth 172 shares representing a more than 50% discount.\n\nI guess the main unknown is what the strike price of the new AMD call option would be. This is the part I couldn't get a great answer when I phoned on Friday. Will call again hoping for some clarification.\n\nI'll probably look to pick up some Jan 2023 XLNX leaps... for 2 reasons.\n\n1) My longest dated call options on AMD are Jun 2022, and I was going to look to get something longer term anyway  \n2) Seems like I can get them at a HUGE discount using XLNX options. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure, I've been long AMD since the beginning of time.\n\nNot investing advice.

        "selftext": "TLDR: Well, there kind of is, but buy shares not options if you want to play!\n\nI closed out my [YOLO](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otg89x/amd_185_is_coming/) today for a nice little profit. It pretty much hit all of my price/IV targets, though the call did not go nearly as high as I hoped:\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otg89x/amd\\_185\\_is\\_coming/h6wt3dp/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otg89x/amd_185_is_coming/h6wt3dp/)\n\nI was about to roll it into XLNX calls to play the \"40% arbitrage\", but after DD, discovered that both AMD and XLNX are surprisingly fairly priced still. Like our beloved squeezes, this one is also all about the options.\n\nHere's the latest AMD and XLNX options priced as of about 12:30pm:\n\n[Options Arbs Non-existent](https://preview.redd.it/9pdcwa8hcdf71.png?width=2518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ca9df47174c3353f263f0abb591ba7c9757d015)\n\nHere's what you're looking at, if/when the merger goes through, each XLNX share is converted into 1.7234 AMD shares. For options, the call is preserved but \"the number of shares covered by a call option is changed to adjust for the value of the buyout\" and  the \"options on the bought-out company will change to options on the buyer stock at the same strike price, but for a different number of shares\"  \\[1\\]\n\nFrom the first line in screenshot above a 95 XLNX Call for 100 XLNX shares currently worth about $54.55 will be converted to a $95 AMD Call for 172 AMD shares. So with this, we can do some simple maths, i.e. the XLNX 95C should be worth 1.7234 AMD95C, which you'll find in the 2nd to last column, $64.77. If the merger went through today, would only be a 18.74% gain.\n\nIV will crush after the merger is approved and if you're lucky, you may get a bit of a bump in price. But to me, this isn't worth playing at these prices.\n\nPositions: Closed AMD and XLNX. Good luck\n\n\\[1\\] [https://pocketsense.com/happens-stock-options-one-company-bought-another-6005.html#:\\~:text=With%20an%20all%2Dstock%20merger,a%20different%20number%20of%20shares](https://pocketsense.com/happens-stock-options-one-company-bought-another-6005.html#:~:text=With%20an%20all%2Dstock%20merger,a%20different%20number%20of%20shares).",

Based on the exchange ratio, this represents approximately $143 per share of Xilinx common stock \".\n\nso forgive me if im retarded, but this is what i think i found:\n\nso amd is worth $111 a share and xilinx is worth $156 a share.\n\nand it states that for every 1 share of xilinx owned, you will receive 1.7234 of amd stock, at todays price, 1.7234 of amd stock is worth $268 (156 x 1.7234)\n\nso according to my retarded self, that would mean that for every $111 share of xilinx you buy, it will be swapped with a amd share worth $268, am i missing something or is this free money lol?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nis there something that would prevent this like dilution or something?",

        "selftext": "Ok idiots listen up AMD is now headed to $269 before EOY.\n\nHere is why:\n1) Intel is getting pantsed by AMD\n2) NVDA is the benchmark stock for AMD to compare against\n3) XLNX merger closes in November (potentially earlier)\n\nFor you non nerds: Smart Intel engineers went to go to work for Facebook, Amazon, Google, Tesla. The idiots that remained screwed up massively over the last 2 years getting ready for the next generations of chips.\nSemiconductor manufacturing is complicated and takes 3 years to work out the kinks on the new technology. TSMC is good and Intel sucks. This will continue for 2-3 more years minimum.\n\n\n1.AMD revenue growth. Last week announced 99% yearly growth. Still room to grow after pulling down Intel\u2019s pants (10% market share for EPYC today, every cloud and enterprise customer is now validating EPYC).\n\n2. NVIDIA is run by the Elon Musk of the semiconductor industry. Jensen has been CEO longer than all the other semiconductor CEOs combined (Internet+Broadcom+Qualcomm+AMD+TSMC+AMD). NVDA earned their 94 p/e. Whose next? AMD\n\n3. Big players are arbitraging XLNX acquisition. Once this selling pressure disappears (presumably around merger closing) it\u2019s gonna rip.\n\nAt the end of this (rev growth, reduced selling pressure, P/E matching NVDA today) AMD will be at $269.",

        "selftext": "Short term volatility is coming!! One of the main arguments for investing - enter &amp; exit timing AMD FOMO???    \nFind out now \u2193    \n\n\n\\--- Promise or non-sense? ---    \n\n\n***About the company***   \n60% of the revenue comes from making processors and GPU for PC, laptop and server (and from me). Other 40% are more chips and technology for game consoles. AMD\u2019s data center business is growing like crazy, and now they\u2019re on their way to acquire Xilinx (Leading provider of adaptive computing solutions). Cause why not?    \n\n\n***Is AMD making money ACTUALLY?***    \nYES, revenue is TWICE as much (99%) as it was last year. Along with HUGE growth on net income and earnings per share, everything\u2019s growing. Price is also at an all time high. Will it do even better? I\u2019d say very likely. Based on chip demand and their business plans, as I mentioned above.  \n***Is AMD worth trading/Investing?***    \nFor swing traders: From a technical viewpoint, the trend is still looking strong. I\u2019d say there\u2019s more room to grow. Even my cat could tell, just please don\u2019t go all in tho, ok? This is another great topic I would love to discuss, how do you deal with stocks that\u2019re at all time high?     \nFor investors: As a gaming nerd, we all know there\u2019re many great games that got postponed due to the pandemic. Fellow nerds are saving up their money for an upgrade. Also, the unsatisfied chip demand.   \n\n\nAll things considered, AMD is a great investment. I would suggest averaging down. Look out for a correction because when everyone's optimistic about a stock, correction tends to mess with you.     \n\n\nDate Written: 2021/8/4, before market open.",

I would like to invest in one of this list:\n\n* SOXX (iShares Semiconductor ETF)\n* SMH (VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF)\n* SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares)\n* PSI (Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF)\n* USD (ProShares Ultra Semiconductors)\n\nyou can consult the reports/data of these various ETFs [here](https://etfdb.com/etfs/industry/semiconductors/).\n\nI really believe that in the long run it will give me a lot of profits, ie integrated circuits, cpus, gpus, sensors and hardware accelerators are our past, present and will be our future !! These ETFs have shares of AMD, Nvidia, Xilinx, NXP, Microchip, Texas Instruments, Maxim Integrated, ASML, TSMC, qorvo, STMicroeletronics...\n\nWill my only solution be to create a pie on the T212 broker similar to these ETFs and invest there? I don't like the T212 very much because they are still very amateur and don't support several important features like merges. For example, if I acquire shares of AMD and Xilinx and AMD's acquisition of Xilinx goes through, they won't be able to merge and sell as my shares of Xilinx without telling me like how it happened to several people holding shares in Tilray and Apharia.",

It\u2019s testing new ATH\u2019s daily and will continue to do so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1cwagjr2s4f71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00c41e9f379512d922b668719961644e4633b09b\n\n \n\nFor the last year, AMD has been a great bluechip to write options on, a staple to market maker strategies. This was a strong naked options play over the last year as you can see it channeled very consistently since it\u2019s previous leg up. \n\nIt was extremely difficult for naked options sellers to predict exactly what happened last week, when it broke $100 for the first time ever. AMD reported strong earnings followed by a massive surge from Xilinx earnings - who they are set to merge with by end of year. \n\nXilinx grew rev by 21% yada yada, basically they smashed it out of the park and are a complimentary product to what AMD offers, therefore simply just adding to AMD\u2019s portfolio of offerings. All of this with a banging R&amp;D budget, combined with AMD\u2019s clear direction and roadmap years, while their competition is lagging behind just trying to get through EoY. \n\nLast time we saw a run like this, AMD run for 40% and then a subsequent squeeze after August options expired for an additional 20%. That puts us at a price target of $140 and squeeze potential of about $170. Not to mention they have tons of known catalysts through the end of year.\n\nThe AMD chart has comfortably and healthily growing since last week, holding at higher price levels day-over-day. Today we will see $110 be that next support level.",

Is that right??? \n\nThis sounds pretty bad to me... however, does the cost base on my 344 AMD shares become $82 ish dollars?\n\nBook cost of 200 XLNX shares is $28,400.... Would I get 344 AMD shares for $28,400?  so that means the cost base on those shares would be $82.50???\n\nIf that's how it works then it's not awful, but if the cost base on my AMD shares is different... like substantially higher, then I should probably just buyback the call and forget about a covered call.",

        "selftext": "Here is how you can buy AMD stock 26% cheaper!\n\nOctober 27th 2020 AMD announced they would acquire XLNX valued at $35 billion at the time.\n\nXilinx stockholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock they hold at the closing of the transaction. The transaction is currently expected to close by the end of calendar year 2021. But AMD stock has since risen about 50% while XLNX has only gained about 16%.\n\nXLNX is currently going for $148 a share and AMD is at $116\n\nThis means that if you buy 1 share of XLNX for $148 you will get 1.7234 shares of AMD when the deal closes. 1.7234 AMD shares is equal to $200. \n\n1.7234 \\* 116 \u2248 200\n\nYou have now spent $148 but have received $200 worth of AMD shares.\n\nThat is $52 difference or 52/200 = 26%\n\nWhat if the deal doesn't go through? I think it will, here is why.\n\nThe transaction has been unanimously approved by the AMD and Xilinx Boards of Directors.\n\nAMD and Xilinx Stockholders Approved AMD\u2019s Acquisition of Xilinx.\n\nThe only thing I can see that might stop it, is not getting approval by chinese regulators. Xilinx is not a chinese company, but they have offices in China and therefore need approval. This is normal and takes time. AMD\u2019s Xilinx Acquisition has Entered Second Phase Of Chinese Regulatory Scrutiny. Phase One lasts 30 days, Phase Two lasts 60 days, and Phase Three lasts 90 days. The regulator decides at the end of each phase if it's ready to make a decision or if it will move on to the next phase. Moving on to Phase Two doesn't necessarily spell trouble for AMD; it simply means they want more information about the deal's potential impact before it reaches a decision. AMD reportedly still believes the deal will close by the end of the year.\n\nOkay so if China says no to the deal will XLNX drop? Probably yes, but not that much. Xilinx is still a 20% YOY growing company and P/E is 47.\n\nThe risk is low and the reward is pretty good. AMD will also probably trade higher by the end of 2021.\n\nHODL XLNX and when the deal closes hopefully by the end of 2021 you got yourself a bunch of delicious AMD shares. \n\nTL;DR: Buy XLNX\n\nThis is not financial advice, I'm just sharing my opinion. You should always do your own research, take a look at my sources (;\n\nSources: \n\n[https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing) \n\n[https://investor.xilinx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-and-xilinx-stockholders-overwhelmingly-approve-amds](https://investor.xilinx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-and-xilinx-stockholders-overwhelmingly-approve-amds) \n\n[https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/strategic-acquisition-xilinx-investor-presentation.pdf](https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/strategic-acquisition-xilinx-investor-presentation.pdf) \n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amds-acquisition-of-xilinx-reportedly-moves-forward-with-chinese-regulators](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amds-acquisition-of-xilinx-reportedly-moves-forward-with-chinese-regulators)",
