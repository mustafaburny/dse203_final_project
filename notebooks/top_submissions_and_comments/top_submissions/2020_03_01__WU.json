        "selftext": "Was about 11 years ago, March 6, 2009. Even after that bottom, for a good 2-3 years, so many people were STILL calling for the apocalypse; they lost so much money, I did too for a while. They had all the fundamental reasons things would go down, and they were really good reasons. Multi-trillions in derivatives that could still go belly up etc.  They ended up being wrong.\n\nI wonder how long we can go up and people will still be bearish about coronavirus not being priced in?  Seems like a lot. That's a lot of money the market can take from new millennial/Z bears that just started getting enough money to start trading. \n\nOne thing about coronavirus as we'll find out with more and more cases, is that the morbidity is going to drop and it won't last more than another month or two.\n\nLast I checked, the stock market is supposed to look into the future beyond just a month or two. Might want to consider that. :D\n\nOf course, we still very well might test the earlier lows for the major indexes, but I'd be buying a lot more at that point... but given how bearish almost everyone is, now's the time to start buying for me!\n\nOn Friday I got VIX 30 puts for 3/25, BAC 4/3 28, CCL 30 3/20, RCL 70 3/20, DAL 48 3/20, JPM 120 4/3, and QQQ 4/3 calls.   \nI'll probably get some puts on oil and oil companies though, might wait for a bounce. \n\nIf the coronavirus isn't the apocalypse and oil stays cheap af, that will be a huge catalyst for the next bull wave.\n\nWu-Tang bitches.",

        "selftext": "Shout out to the Autists operating on the same wave length of the spectrum as me, because the printer is finally working.\n\nGot burned for $2.5K (have proof) on some MSFT TQQQ calls at end of the bubble trading options on RobinHood, but hated it. Their garbage UI helped me understand options in a clown like way, but it was inefficient. \n\nAlmost gave up on options. But on Feb 27 I saw the Wu Flu coming, liquidated my boomer positions and started paying Schwab 65\u00a2 a trick for SPY, AAL, ALK, JBLU, SAVE, UAL, CCL, RCL, NCLH, BKNG, TRIP, EXPE, MGM, LVS, WYNN, DIS, SIX, SEAS puts and VIXY calls. Made a few rookie mistakes along the way, but now my dick is starting to fly off. \n\nBeen holding with diamond hands through the volatility, but finally took some gains today. Sitting on \\~140k in cash overnight to buy the dead cat bounce with SPY (and maybe INDA) tomorrow.\n\nr/options is good for technical shit, but you retards are funny as fuck. \n\nThanks.",

You head off to the casino as soon as the night-bus arrives and you see the roulette is already packed and full of action, you can't wait to try your new double-or-bust system, especially since this particular wheel has no green slots; it's 50/50 and no house edge!\n\nYou see another set of people off to the side of the table with a big LED screen and a way of betting on \"future\" balls thrown on to the wheel. Interestingly, this board seems to correlate with the chance of a color coming in based on the previous rolls.\n\nPrevious 5 rolls: Red, Black, Red, Red, Black\n\nNext Roll: 60% Black\n\nYou think, well if the futures tell me the odds of black are 60%, I must win 60% of the time meaning I will over time and guarantee my income.

        "selftext": "I don\u2019t even know if anyone can see this post. I think I may have been shadow banned at some point near the peak. I don\u2019t know, but I really care about this community and the last hour has drove that point home. \n\nMods have been doing an impossible and thankless task so far in 2020 (except the Pokimane thing, that was not funny on any level).  You guys are working your asses of for zero gain and a bunch of pain. So first, thank you. This isn\u2019t a critique, this is just coming from a place of ignorance and trying to help. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do to stay in the sub, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do to be allowed to post. Do I contact a mod? Do I get on the discord server and bitch? There\u2019s no real documented path back from exile right now and it is confusing and upsetting, is it possible to post something to help those autists who are lost and can\u2019t find their way home to their tendies?\n\n1MM subs is a lot. An insane amount. I get going private, I get cutting the insane stream of absolute drivel that doesn\u2019t even remotely qualify as a shitpost. Is there a way to reduce this beyond going private? Or is this a natural progression of the sub? Do we stop trying to fight it and instead know that when this shitstorm passes the normies will lose interest?\n\nI don\u2019t know, but I do know I care about this sub, I care about the stupid memes and the DD alike. You all brought me from a normie with an account full of SPY bagholding to a fully fledged autist with an options account full of OTM FDs. Don\u2019t ever change. \n\nAlso, SPY 4/09 235. The Orange One has the Wu Tang Flu and the paper operation, the rate cut, they\u2019re all worthless. Get your tendies while they are hot and crispy.",
