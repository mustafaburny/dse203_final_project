        "selftext": "Just some ramblings from a 59 year old investor. Been through this in 87 and 2008 and it's the same every time. The world as we know it is ending, the rules for investing have changed, the paradigm has shifted, etc.... and we're all F'd. Yesterday the volume was huge and everything was getting kicked to the curb, in all categories, even gold and crypto. That's the definition of panic. Throwing out the babies with the bathwater. I was sitting on cash but putting it to work now. Started buying in at -15% and have been cost average buying every 5% pts down. I'm about 2/3's done. Bought heavily at the close yesterday and wanted to puke the whole time and my inner dialogue was telling me what a moron I am. Yesterday had all the symptoms of capitulation when we were down 27% peak to trough, but I think we'll end up down 30-35% all totaled before this is over, so there will be plenty of buy opportunities over the next few weeks. From there we may bounce around in a short lived bear market that traders will like. Not quite the existential financial crisis of 2008 but close. Loading up on MSFT, DIS, CSCO, AAPL, BAC, CVS, SBUX, MA, VZ, T, MU, STX, NKE etc... and plan to hold for 10+ year timeline. When this is over, interest rates will be at zero and people have to put their money somewhere for any kind of yield. If you got caught in this downdraft and you're at the point now where the pain is kicking your ass and you're tempted to sell... I gave in and did that in 2008 and when I reverse engineer if I had just done nothing and just shut my computer, I would have doubled my money in the following 5-7 years. Remember, nearly everyone you see commenting on CNBC and every article you read from the so called experts, all have a position to protect and every word they speak is in service of protecting that position/gameplan.",

        "selftext": "**$RUN**\n\nThis is what I'm talking about. You see those solar panels in the rich neighborhoods? That's SunRun. It's the perfect company for middle-upper class suburban normies to feel better about their footprint and so all the housewives can tell eachother how green they are. Super foods? Nah. Kale chips? Nah. Solar panels motherfucker. This shit right here:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/TzSjcJA.png\n\nSunRun takes the hard part out of the equation. Their solar panels and batteries are resold Panasonic equipment. Panasonic just canceled their solar panel deal with TSLA, but they're still strong with SunRun:\n\nmarketwatch[.]com/story/panasonic-drops-out-of-solar-panel-partnership-with-tesla-2020-02-26\n\nPanasonic knows its easier to just pump these mother fuckers out to companies like SunRun than form some \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b partnership with Tesla.\n\nSunrun is in my area (MA) and they're booming, look at this:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/R8FuX7I.png\n\nThey're pumping out offices to sell solar panels to housewives at an extreme rate. It's already all over California. They even formed a partnership with my energy company, and our energy company gives us incentives to go with Sunrun.\n\n**Company Hiring**\n\nLet's focus on their hiring for a second. They're hiring a billion retards for their massive growth:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/AZOAtaF.png\n\n687 Listings on LinkedIn, 500 on indeed, more on their website. Anything from Software Engineers to VPs to marketers, etc.\n\nThey're in the process of expanding their company nationwide and hiring out the yahoo to do so, practically handing out jobs. One of their main issues last year was they couldn't hire enough retards to sell this shit, what kind of company can say that.\n\nOnce a housewife buys this shit, she tells all her friends and they **cuck the fuck out of their husbands to get solar panels too.** Even better SunRun is ran by an empowered super woman. Check out this article showing you how brave and strong she is:\n\nnytimes[.]com/2020/01/23/business/lynn-jurich-sunrun.html\n\n**Earnings**\n\nGood or bad earnings, these guys JUMP insanely on earnings news. Next earnings date is in May.\n\nQ3 2019: Beat EPS by 450%\n\nQ4 2019: Missed EPS but beat Revenue\n\nThis is normal during a hyper-growth stage, more money is being put into company spending, they're also buying back stock, opening new offices, hiring a billion people, etc. It's no worry as revenue did not miss, which is what you'd expect. Plus who the fuck buys solar panels in the winter?\n\nThey are floating **a ton of cash** for a company their size. Their assets are dank AF and show they're getting ready to POP. Don't believe the \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3bthat tried to downplay sunrun last earnings, they have already recovered, eating away all the losses.\n\n**Take a look at any neighborhood near you on Google Satellite, and you'll see just how popular solar panels are getting, its the next big thing. Buy whatever the housewives want, they control their husbands.**\n\n**Volume**\n\nThey have great volume for their size surprisingly. I haven't played the options market with them yet, but it seems like a steady amount of activity, mostly bullish. \n\n**Here is some of their option activity I've seen by major investors** (note this does not guarantee anything):\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/N5XE59B.png\n\n**Recent off the market print @22.47 a share (current $20.22):** (note this doesn't guarantee anything)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/y0SkDWy.png\n\nThat's an 18% volume print.\n\n**Competitors and Similar Companies:**\n\nSunRun is a bit unique, they don't seem to have any competition that is moving this fast, spreading to this many markets, etc. \n\n**One of their main competitors was SolarCity, and SolarCity is dead, and Tesla Solar (solarcity) just lost their Panasonic partnership.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI think SunRun is in a position to greatly grow their company, they're already expanding at a ludicrous rate, hiring as many employees as they can, and emerging in new cities, forming deals with local energy companies for incentives to the buyer, etc. I knew nothing about them until my energy company National Grid sent me information about them. They've mailed pamphlets to all their customers, and in MA we care a lot about sustainable energy (we even get to pick if we want our energy to come from renewable resources).\n\nWith the recent market activity regarding them, it seems that the major investors are waking up to this too. With the recent downside we've seen across the market, they're sitting at a very tolerable price for new investors.\n\nFor options taking into consideration the bullish major investor purchasing, I'd say any March 20 calls ($23,$24,$25,$27,$28) to capitalize on any pop and for an earnings play, you'd want May 20 ($25+). They're pretty cheap you could pick up a few yolos for 20 in tendies.",

Although in the week ahead bearish positions are still justifiable positions longer term are exposed to too much risk to justify. Possible 2% gap down or more on Monday. Keep watching futures and news to confirm. Look for short/put entries EOW or early in the next week if bull trap is confirmed.

        "selftext": "While writing this, SPY's ten year trend line has been broken. This leaves 250 as the next point of resistance. If 250 is broken, [u/Variation-Separate](https://www.reddit.com/user/Variation-Separate/) could be spot on with his 269 rally prediction.\n\nI expect Friday's unemployment numbers to affect the current trend ([https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news\\_release/laus.htm](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/laus.htm)). Everyone expects the numbers to be bad, so it's a matter of how bad. If the numbers are not too bad it could actually help this rally, however if they're awful it may halt or reverse the rally. Right now estimates sit between 1 million and 2.5 million unemployed.\n\nI am starting to feel COVID is getting closer to being priced in. I am starting to doubt we see SPY reach $200/share. The sectors that will be hit the hardest have already taken -50+% losses and the companies that can survive the pandemic are beginning to level off or rise.\n\nI was too young to experience the 2008 housing crisis however I do not look at this as a similar situation. Based off of what I've heard, people were in denial of the housing bubble fucking the economy in 2008. Today, people are aware of the problems facing the economy and many of the companies that will be affected most by COVID have already taken heavy losses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt looks like Visa, MasterCard, AAPL, and real estate is keeping the S&amp;P in the green. Airlines are also doing pretty great. Communication services, IT, health care, and AMZN are struggling.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Q6ppJiA](https://imgur.com/a/Q6ppJiA) (Screenshot taken at 11:42 EST)\n\n \\- Visa seems to be following Mastercard similar to how Lyft is following Uber. Yesterday MA issued a second COVID-19 revenue warning causing a red day while the S&amp;P500 finished green. Today marks a record breaking green day for the two so plenty of investors feel comfortable jumping aboard despite the COVID-19 revenue warnings. I don't expect V and MA to prop up the S&amp;P any further tomorrow. Green will have to come from elsewhere if the rally is to continue to 270, however I don't expect V or MA to hold the S&amp;P back from the rally.\n\n \\- Deutsche bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes now is the time to buy AAPL with a price target of $270 (from $290). He sees risks such as store closures and supply chain delays as short term problems. Ong is relying on the incoming 5G IPhone cycle to drive strong growth. I highly doubt AAPL will be holding back the S&amp;P from rallying. Investors plan on staying for the long term.\n\n \\- Real Estate seems to be green primarily due to the promise of an economic relief package passing. This green is heavily reliant on the relief package passing in the senate. The same is true for airlines. I expect the bill to pass today. Sen. Dick Derbin (Minority whip) is very excited about the bill. Watch the live stream here: [https://www.c-span.org/video/?470652-1/senate-expected-vote-coronavirus-economic-relief-bill&amp;live](https://www.c-span.org/video/?470652-1/senate-expected-vote-coronavirus-economic-relief-bill&amp;live)\n\n \\- Communication Services (Google and Facebook) are strong. I am confident Google will not be impacted very heavily by COVID-19. Today's red day is temporary. They make money from providing advertisements and can artificially modify their supply by showing less or more advertisements to fit any demand. They are clearly confident in their ability to weather this storm because they just extended contracts for contracted employees by 90 days. They also have funds to help part time workers. FB will be weaker than Google but I expect them to also be fine.\n\n \\- Amazon stopped taking orders in India for the next 21 days due to the country wide lock down. They are also only accepting essential items at their warehouses in the US. With the expected spike in unemployed, I see a decline in online shopping despite more people staying at home.  I expect this to continue weighing down the stock while COVID spreads.\n\n \\- Consumer Staples (Walmart, PG, etc) are fairly neutral today however I expect COVID to continue weighing negatively on these companies. I doubt they rise anytime soon. They may continue falling. I'm not sure if it will be enough to bring down the entire index.\n\n \\- I'm not very familiar with our health care system so cannot at this time provide much DD on this sector. I also haven't mentioned anything about the Financials, Industrials, Utilities, Energy, or Materials sectors of the S&amp;P500 because I don't know shit about them. I'm still learning...\n\n \\- Oil prices are beginning to rise. Check u/Variation-Seperate's excellent DD on how this could affect SPY.",

Long/Call position face significant risk as resistances become increasingly significant after 260. 274 and 289 VPVR predict as the most significant resistance price level in SPY\u2019s history (if it ever reaches those levels). Typical retracement for these types of sudden bounces put targets around 275 making 265 a much safer target.

It was the best decision I ever made.\n\nIf you've lost a bunch of money the past few weeks, which you probably have because you're not me, you need to stop investing in options right now and take a break from everything related to the market. You need to take a long hard look in the mirror and be honest about all of the reasons why you made the decisions you made. Until you can rationally accept your own retardedness, you will never be able to overcome your inner retard to make better investment decisions in the future.\n\nI'm not going to respond to all my DMs from today but here are some of the things I've learned from failing previously which might be helpful to you. Yeah I know it's super gay to post shit like this on wsb but whatever. I feel like there might be people on the brink.\n\n**1.** **Don't chase.**  \nYou can either be chasing or you can be anticipating. You can\u2019t be both. YOLO is funny and has a great reddit gold dividend yield, but at some point it\u2019s nice to make dollars . And not just once cause you\u2019re lucky, but like, consistently. Making money consistently means you\u2019re anticipating, not chasing. And anticipating means building an investment strategy and a plan around every trade you make.   \n**2. Make a list**   \nHere\u2019s a simple rule I try to follow. Every trade I make I need to be able to write down three reasons why I\u2019m making the trade, and three reasons why I could be wrong. Writing down the ways I could be wrong helps me manage my risk. When I entered index puts in the second and third week of Feb while everyone was foaming at the mouth chasing single stonk calls that seemed like they could only go up for forever, I was nervous about a full parabolic move to the upside. So as a result I bought longer dated puts that would give time for my bear thesis to play out. I also limited my position to 50% of what I wanted to allocate to bearish puts, which was already a fraction of my total portfolio. This would give me another opportunity to buy puts at a higher strike/lower price if buying momentum went properly parabolic. Don't set yourself up for a devastating loss. Options are insanely high risk. If you're putting more than 5-10% of your total portfolio into options trading you're a fucking retard.\n\n**Here are some of the things I listed out as reasons to buy my puts 2nd/3rd week of Feb**, almost at the tippy top. [Here are some of my very amateur charts that show some of these things iI was looking at at the time f its helpful to you.](https://imgur.com/a/o12WrQB)\n\n\\- massive bearish capitulations. CBOE equity/put call ratio was at near record lows through Feb, massively capitulation in open short interest on indices.  \n\\- NDX was wildly over extended. Almost 3 std. devs above 200 MA, weekly RSI approaching tech bubble levels  \n\\- very poor breadth across indices. Big tech was pulling up NDX and S&amp;P but breadth across all major indices was indicating a top  \n\\- corona virus economic impacts building in the background but market just kept ignoring it  \n\\- corona aside, lots of underlying economic fundamentals to be worried about - plunging yields (even before stonks imploded), poor JOLTS through Feb, declines in shipping, trucking etc. The list goes on.  \n\n\nMy goal with the puts was to see a reversion to the 200 MA across SPX and NDX and close when it approached.\n\n**Here are some of the things I listed before I closed all my puts but one last week and bought calls on Thursday and Friday.**\n\n\\- NDX approaching 200 day MA and then hard bounced  \n\\- VIX shit like I already posted  \n\\- very rapid skew to equity and index puts over the course of all the selling last week\n\nThe list of reasons to not do the trade was pretty good so I limited it to like 7-8%ish of what I wanted to have invested in options, which was like a tiny part of my portfolio and wouldn't kill me if I was wrong. I also left open my longest dated put from earlier in feb as a hedge. \n\n**When I exit a trade, try and write down what I would have done differently and what I was wrong about. Systematic learning is the only way to consistently make money and train yourself out of trading on emotion/retardation**\n\n\\- I closed out one of my SQQQ positions early today. **SQQQ is super gay.** NEVER TRADE OPTIONS ON SQQQ. Fuck SQQQ.  \n**Don\u2019t make a trade unless the trade comes to you.** Patiently sitting in cash waiting for a high probability trade opportunity to come to you is 9 times out of 10 going to make you more money than rushing in to something. If you miss a move let it go. Never fucking chase.\n\n**Follow peeps on Fintwit** Lots of amazing hedge fund guys posting insightful shit on fintwit. Get on there and follow a bunch of people with opposing views on stuff. It will help you build a filter for what's right and what's BS which will make you a better decision maker. **If you only ever read news sites like bloomberg or marketwatch you will always be poor.**\n\n**The best trades are always non-obvious.** Some people pervert this and become perma bulls or perma bears. Look at Peter Schiff. That dude made a huge non-obvious bet ahead of the housing collapse and then was wrong like 9 times out of 10 for like 10 years straight after that. The guy is right sometimes and retarded most of the time. Don't be like him.\n\n**STOP FUCKING ASKING ME WHAT THE MOVES ARE FOR TOMORROW** If you feel the need to make a move every day you will always be poor.  \n\n\n**TLDR In the long run WSBgod loses all his money and prudent WSBers make bank.**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are expected to see more wild swings, even if Fed makes big policy move  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/stocks-are-expected-to-see-more-wild-swings-even-if-fed-makes-big-policy-move.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday\u2019s 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&amp;P is now 20.2% below its February high.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&amp;P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could say we\u2019re pricing a garden variety recession,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. \u201cWe come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.\u201d She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&amp;P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf [S&amp;P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,\u201d said Calvasina.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we needed to get through this week, in particular \u2014 the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close\u201d to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.\n*****\n&gt; But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.\n*****\n&gt; Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.\n*****\n&gt; As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cIn 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,\u201d said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. \u201cI think something else we\u2019ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed\u2019s policy response that could drive the market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,\u201d Goldman economists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a \u201cpatient\u201d stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&amp;P companies\u2019 balance sheets are in really good shape,\u201d Calvasina said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/iG7ENVB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4gwPTzC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/h9DkOZJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4m2QVZH.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/akOOH97.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/slVwGv2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ASyHg6a.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rbgSrGQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eS99ijc.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tEs62Hh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kMQTBj6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/toentZ2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ozn837y.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Signs Of A Washout?\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&amp;P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.\n\n&gt; From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.\n\n&gt; Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&amp;P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn\u2019t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market\u2019s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday\u2019s sell-off left less 6% of the S&amp;P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. \u201cThese are truly frightening times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Signs_of_Washout.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Fastest Bear Market Ever\n\n&gt; The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Not to be outdone, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&amp;P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMarkets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.\u201d\n\n&gt; Last, one of Warren Buffett\u2019s most famous quotes is, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.\u201d We\u2019ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear &amp; Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning\u2019s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines\n\n&gt; Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.\n\n&gt; First of all yes, this time is different \u2013 and yet it\u2019s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market\u2019s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it\u2019s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.\n\n&gt; Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It\u2019s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31cca506c45d87ad962ce9c707baf21a/fc7021573b50880b-76/s500x750/0a6588971f599cbbca194b38b62a47c087875238.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover &amp; End Losing Friday Streak\n\n&gt; Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 &amp; 144 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday\u2019s have been weaker in bear markets.\n\n&gt; However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.\n\n &gt; In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8d6237984423d89dc5b20f4a1bf7009/07327bf517318c16-1e/s500x750/13020ac23c0adf1831e35c982c37f1602a236fd1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages\n\n&gt; The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&amp;P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**\n\n&gt; The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Above-200-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.\n\n&gt; What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/raymktcap.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging\n\n&gt; Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**\n\n&gt; Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-ref.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$MOMO** \n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$CRWD** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$BE** \n&gt; * **$MDB** \n&gt; * **$BZUN** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$YY** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$MUX** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$TME** \n&gt; * **$MIK** \n&gt; * **$CVSI** \n&gt; * **$ACRX** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$WPRT** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$GIS**\n&gt; * **$CPRX** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$TLRD** \n&gt; * **$ZTO** \n&gt; * **$BAX** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$DLTH** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$CTAS** \n&gt; * **$SMAR** \n&gt; * **$WSM** \n&gt; * **$TCOM** \n&gt; * **$HIBB** \n&gt; * **$REI** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$CTRA** \n&gt; * **$GPL** \n&gt; * **$CMC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKAkJgU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR  THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/631cGTg.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FLCjERW.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GCK6dns.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J7uVG2b.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ADUyE5E.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/q2AM8aO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sXXUKYj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZISY7gz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pgdAKJu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.20.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# NIO Inc. $3.11\n&gt; **NIO Inc.

With that being done, I have a lot of cash on hand and have finally decided to invest. So, I was able to hire a professional Stockbroker to invest for me. I am a single 35F who has no expenses but my own. The man I hired was recommended to me and is quite reputable. He deals with clients like myself a lot. However, after talking with some friends, they didn\u2019t agree with a lot of his choices. I\u2019m here to ask some of you experts if the choices he made are OK and the right ones. \nThey are: CMG, DRI, MCD, SBUX, BRK.B, V, MA, DIS, SOXL, JPM, MSFT, VOO, SPY, JLL, TTD, SPG, VTI, LMT, AAPL, and GOOG\n\n\n\nFeel free to PM and comment:) Thanks!",

Currently, OKTA is not profitable. OKTA has beat earnings 100% of the time for the past 2 years. However, the earnings performance was not always positive. This means that outside of beating earnings, OKTA must navigate both profit-collection and lackluster guidance. Okta currently does not pay a dividend. One risk factor is OKTA\u2019s D/E Ratio, which is 230+. This is incredibly high and poses a risk for long term OKTA holders. \n\n**Technical**: Price at the 50D moving average, below the 20 day MA and above the 200DMA.  MACD shows bullish divergence. RSI shows around 50. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 7.4% or about 9.56$ Short interest is at 6.6%, with 6.9 days to cover. \n\n**Sentimental**: Being an unprofitable tech growth company is current macro conditions is very risky. Extrapolating SPLK\u2019s earnings, we can say that the market expectations for profitable company was already very high. OKTA must continue its streak while proving that they can hit profitability. Any mistakes will be heavily punished. Currently, its EPS and Revenue revisions have been very bullish, in addition to a recent price correction from the 140\u2019s. While I believe OKTA will beat earnings, the guidance will not be bullish enough for the stock to pop. \n\n**Robinhood (3/5/2020) Less Fucky. Not using. Moving to Schwab this weekend.** \n\n**Call Credit Spread 3/13 - Easier one**\n\n**Buy 140 Call**\n\n**Sell 135 Call**\n\n**Iron Condors 3/06 - much riskier**\n\n**117/139, 2$ width.**\n\n**There are lofty expectations on OKTA right now and with the given environment, I don\u2019t think they will be satisfied. Profitability remains an issue alongside massive debt.**",

Dow futures hit their 5% \u201climit down\u201d overnight, and were off 600-points at one stage Monday morning, as a massive coronavirus funding package failed a key Senate procedural vote Sunday.

The Federal Reserve and Treasury are working on financing programs that could be worth $4 trillion. Goldman Sachs upgraded shares of Boeing, which is hoping for a bailout.

New Jersey, California and Illinois round out the top five states. President Donald Trump on Sunday activated the National Guard in New York, Washington state and California in order to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

        "selftext": "IPIX and AIM\n\nSee below for latest news on both. \n\n\nInnovation Pharmaceuticals Brilacidin Received by U.S. Regional Biocontainment Laboratory; Testing Against Coronavirus (COVID-19)\n \nWAKEFIELD, MA \u2013 March 9, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) Innovation Pharmaceuticals (OTCQB:IPIX) (\u201cthe Company\u201d), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, announces today the Company has been notified by one of the 12 Regional Biocontainment Labs (RBLs) in the United States that it received shipment of Brilacidin, the Company\u2019s defensin mimetic drug candidate, for testing against SARS-CoV-2, the specific coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Brilacidin is immediately being placed into queue and the Company anticipates confirmation of the testing schedule as well as procedures for the studies later this week.\n \nBrilacidin and COVID-19\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak poses a significant life-threatening and economic risk throughout the world. Over 109,500 cases have been diagnosed in at least 95 countries, resulting in 3,800 reported deaths, including 479 cases and 21 fatalities in the U.S. There are no effective approved therapies to treat COVID-19. Brilacidin is one of the few drugs targeting COVID-19 that has been tested in human trials for other clinical indications, providing an established safety and efficacy profile, thereby potentially enabling it to rapidly help address the emerging worldwide coronavirus crisis, developed both as an intravenous medicine and as a vaccine. There is no assurance made or implied that testing Brilacidin for antiviral activity against any coronavirus will be successful.\n\nAlerts\nSign-up for Innovation Pharmaceuticals email alerts is available at:\nhttp://www.ipharminc.com/email-alerts/\n\n\n\nAIM ImmunoTech\u2019s Drug Ampligen to Be Tested by Japan\u2019s National Institute of Infectious Diseases as a Potential Treatment for the New SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Responsible for the New Human Infectious Disease COVID-19\nMonday, March 9, 2020 6:30 AM\nOCALA, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 9, 2020 / AIM ImmunoTech (NYSE American:AIM), an immuno-pharma company focused on the research and development of therapeutics to treat immune disorders, viral diseases and multiple types of cancers, today announced that the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan will begin testing AIM's drug Ampligen as a potential treatment for COVID-19, the new coronavirus infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The experimental program will be conducted at both the NIID and the University of Tokyo.\n\nThe testing and research are being conducted by Hideki Hasegawa, MD, PhD, Director of the NIID's Influenza Virus Research Center, and Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Tokyo and Takeshi Ichinohe, PhD, Department of Pathology at the NIID, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science.\n\n\"As we have been saying all along, this emerging pandemic is caused by a virus that has nearly identical regulatory RNA sequences to the original SARS coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-1, in respect to pathogenesis. This means that the prior studies of Ampligen in SARS-CoV-1 animal experimentation may predict similar protective effects against the new virus. The WHO has recently renamed this emerging, highly pathogenic virus as SARS-CoV-2,\" said AIM CEO Thomas K. Equels. \"Ampligen had excellent antiviral activity against the earlier SARS coronavirus in U.S. National Institutes of Health-contracted animal experiments. In those studies of SARS-infected mice, Ampligen stands out as the only drug tested that conferred a significant survival effect: 100% of the Ampligen-treated mice survived, while none of the untreated mice survived. Because SARS-CoV-2 shares many critical similarities with SARS-CoV-1, Ampligen may have an important role to play in developing a protective early-onset therapy for this new highly pathogenic coronavirus in humans, where currently there is no known effective therapy. We are proud to work with Japan's universally esteemed NIID in the battle to curb this emerging potential pandemic.\"\n\nAmpligen has established itself as a broad-spectrum antiviral with an extremely well-developed safety profile (See: \"Ampligen as an Antiviral,\" safety slides 7-15, at https://aimimmuno.com/events-presentations/).\n\nAIM will provide stockholders and the market with updates on results as they are available.",

        "selftext": "Hello Fellow Traders and Investors,\n\nI would like you to consider the following the following data points:\n\n1. A coronavirus vaccine would take 12-18 months to develop fast-tracked.  And that's the best case scenario.  Like many other viruses, it could take years and be plagued with many problems.  A vaccine might not save us from our social-isolation economy for a long time.\n2. Herd immunity is likely to require [significantly more than 60%](https://www.sciencealert.com/why-herd-immunity-will-not-save-us-from-the-covid-19-pandemic) of the population to be immune to coronavirus.  If this is season and each outbreak has to be kept to 1-2% of the population so as not to overwhelm hospitals, it would take many years before herd immunity rescues us from our stay-at-home economy.\n\nSo, who are the losers in  3-5 years of a \"Coronavirus Economy\"?  What businesses are unlikely to recover in spite of federal bailouts?\n\nWell, if there is a partial lock-down for years, I think the big loser will be commercial real estate.  All the places that make money collecting rent for large groups of people.  Maybe malls, convention centers, sports arenas.  If the outbreaks are seasonal, then cold weather gatherings.  Ice hockey rinks.  Concert halls.  There must be some sort of commercial REITs that can be shorted, or at least buy some far out put options for.\n\nBut more than that, if there is a prolonged retail slump then all the businesses that support the back end of retail will suffer.  Which companies service the websites, apps, and payment collection for small businesses?  I assume credit card companies get better margins from small customers rather than large, so a bunch of people switching to Amazon and Walmart might mean reduced income for Visa and Mastercard.\n\nAnyway, my question is this:  what are you speculative investing opinions assuming a partial shutdown that last years?\n\nEdit:  by \"partial shutdown\" I mean that we would reopen most things with much increased social distancing, like China has done.  But we might not be able to fully open crowded venues.",

I looked at GILD for 68 rate, but they went up like 13% this week, don't think they'll come close again.

New Jersey, California and Illinois round out the top five states. President Donald Trump on Sunday activated the National Guard in New York, Washington state and California in order to combat the spread of the coronavirus. New York plans to run a clinical trial, beginning Tuesday, of a treatment regimen of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin, a drug cocktail that has shown promise in fighting the coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Global coronavirus cases topped 343,000, with 14,789 deaths and over 98,800 recoveries. China, where the outbreak started in December, still has the most cases at over 81,400. China\u2019s 3,274 deaths are second to Italy\u2019s 5,476 deaths.

The S&amp;P is now 20.2% below its February high.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&amp;P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could say we\u2019re pricing a garden variety recession,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. \u201cWe come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.\u201d She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&amp;P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf [S&amp;P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,\u201d said Calvasina.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we needed to get through this week, in particular \u2014 the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close\u201d to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.\n*****\n&gt; But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.\n*****\n&gt; Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.\n*****\n&gt; As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cIn 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,\u201d said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. \u201cI think something else we\u2019ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed\u2019s policy response that could drive the market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,\u201d Goldman economists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a \u201cpatient\u201d stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&amp;P companies\u2019 balance sheets are in really good shape,\u201d Calvasina said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/iG7ENVB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4gwPTzC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/h9DkOZJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4m2QVZH.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/akOOH97.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/slVwGv2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ASyHg6a.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rbgSrGQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eS99ijc.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tEs62Hh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kMQTBj6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/toentZ2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ozn837y.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Signs Of A Washout?\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&amp;P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.\n\n&gt; From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.\n\n&gt; Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&amp;P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn\u2019t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market\u2019s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday\u2019s sell-off left less 6% of the S&amp;P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. \u201cThese are truly frightening times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Signs_of_Washout.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Fastest Bear Market Ever\n\n&gt; The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Not to be outdone, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&amp;P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMarkets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.\u201d\n\n&gt; Last, one of Warren Buffett\u2019s most famous quotes is, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.\u201d We\u2019ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear &amp; Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning\u2019s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines\n\n&gt; Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.\n\n&gt; First of all yes, this time is different \u2013 and yet it\u2019s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market\u2019s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it\u2019s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.\n\n&gt; Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It\u2019s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31cca506c45d87ad962ce9c707baf21a/fc7021573b50880b-76/s500x750/0a6588971f599cbbca194b38b62a47c087875238.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover &amp; End Losing Friday Streak\n\n&gt; Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 &amp; 144 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday\u2019s have been weaker in bear markets.\n\n&gt; However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.\n\n &gt; In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8d6237984423d89dc5b20f4a1bf7009/07327bf517318c16-1e/s500x750/13020ac23c0adf1831e35c982c37f1602a236fd1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages\n\n&gt; The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&amp;P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**\n\n&gt; The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Above-200-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.\n\n&gt; What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/raymktcap.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging\n\n&gt; Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**\n\n&gt; Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-ref.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 13th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=corMYre6O0E))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.15.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$MOMO** \n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$CRWD** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$BE** \n&gt; * **$MDB** \n&gt; * **$BZUN** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$YY** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$MUX** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$TME** \n&gt; * **$MIK** \n&gt; * **$CVSI** \n&gt; * **$ACRX** \n&gt; * **$ACN** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$WPRT** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$GIS **\n&gt; * **$CPRX** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$TLRD** \n&gt; * **$ZTO** \n&gt; * **$BAX** \n&gt; * **$LEN** \n&gt; * **$DLTH** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$CTAS** \n&gt; * **$SMAR** \n&gt; * **$WSM** \n&gt; * **$TCOM** \n&gt; * **$HIBB** \n&gt; * **$REI** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$CTRA** \n&gt; * **$GPL** \n&gt; * **$CMC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKAkJgU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR  THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/631cGTg.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FLCjERW.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GCK6dns.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J7uVG2b.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ADUyE5E.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/q2AM8aO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sXXUKYj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZISY7gz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pgdAKJu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.20.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# NIO Inc. $3.11\n&gt; **NIO Inc.

Although in the week ahead bearish positions are still justifiable positions longer term are exposed to too much risk to justify. Possible 2% gap down or more on Monday. Keep watching futures and news to confirm. Look for short/put entries EOW or early in the next week if bull trap is confirmed.

        "selftext": "Hey, so I'm rather new to investing and have been doing some research after the recent pandemic with Corona Virus. I've wanted to start investing the past few years, but I've had other things sucking up my time to do the proper research in order to get into it properly. The next coming weeks seem like the best time to finally start investing and I was wondering if my \"strategy\" is safe or dangerous.\n\nTo start, I am 27 years old, unmarried, and have no dependents. I have approximately $150,000 in savings currently and have a stable job. I am thinking of investing $100k of those savings into Individual stocks in these next coming weeks when they hit low points that seem satisfying to me. The ones I am mainly looking at are Disney, Boeing, Visa, Mastercard, &amp; Google. The way I see it, these companies still have a ways to go in regards to being affected by the market's inevitable downturn; but in my eyes, they also seem like very strong companies that will eventually bounce back in the long term.\n\nI'm just wondering if I am being to naive and impulsive with this particular strategy, or is it relatively safe in your guys' opinion? From what I gathered it appears to be rather frowned upon on this Reddit to put all your eggs into Individual stocks, but in my very inexperienced opinion, this seems like the right time (next few weeks to months) to safely do just that. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

I know they charge .20 basis pts for conversion   + any other fees, as opposed to transferring directly in USD?   \nb) does IB charge for withdrawals? does my cash not invested in my account earn any interest?  \nc)  Are there any alternative platforms better than Monzo/Revolut/a UK bank account to transfer USD to IB?   \n\n\nOther q's on anyone familiar with Monzo and Revolut:  \nWhich of Monzo/Revolut offers a more favourable GBP to USD rate? I'm aware that Monzo uses mastercard rates whilst Revolut uses their own rates  \nb) On Monzo, every time I do a transfer from GBP toUSD, I see an interim rate with the disclaimer 'this is not the final rate, it will settle after a few days'- does this mean they can change the amount they charge me if the rate 'after a few days' is different?  \nc) On revolut, one can create alerts for currency exchange rates- are you also able to set up a conversion order when the exchange rate hits your desired amount? i.e. if 1GBP=1.31, exchange xxxxGBP to USD.   \n\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "Some technicals:  Ali Baba made a new technical low today on point and figure.  On the daily chart it has support on the 200 MA at 185.  It already broke support at the 50 MA at $215  on 2/18.  I would target an exit point at or around the 185 level.\n\nFundamentals:  Ali Baba has had a growing presence competing with ebay on their web site aliexpress.  However their brand image of cheap 3rd party goods Made in China has been destroyed.  They stopped or are delaying shipping of non-essential items from China.  Not to mention there is now a lot of distrust among other countries' buyers. \n\nHowever, the unknown factor in the room is the Chinese government's ability to intervene in the markets at will.  \n\nWondering if buying 3 month puts out is worth it on a greater index bounce.  It is not worth buying any puts at this point b/c of the high cost from IV.  The VIX is at a ridiculously high level.",

Currently, OKTA is not profitable. OKTA has beat earnings 100% of the time for the past 2 years. However, the earnings performance was not always positive. This means that outside of beating earnings, OKTA must navigate both profit-collection and lackluster guidance. Okta currently does not pay a dividend. One risk factor is OKTA\u2019s D/E Ratio, which is 230+. This is incredibly high and poses a risk for long term OKTA holders. \n\n**Technical**: Price at the 50D moving average, below the 20 day MA and above the 200DMA.  MACD shows bullish divergence. RSI shows around 50. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 7.4% or about 9.56$ Short interest is at 6.6%, with 6.9 days to cover. \n\n**Sentimental**: Being an unprofitable tech growth company is current macro conditions is very risky. Extrapolating SPLK\u2019s earnings, we can say that the market expectations for profitable company was already very high. OKTA must continue its streak while proving that they can hit profitability. Any mistakes will be heavily punished. Currently, its EPS and Revenue revisions have been very bullish, in addition to a recent price correction from the 140\u2019s. While I believe OKTA will beat earnings, the guidance will not be bullish enough for the stock to pop. \n\n**Robinhood (3/5/2020) Less Fucky. Not using. Moving to Schwab this weekend.** \n\n**Call Credit Spread 3/13 - Easier one**\n\n**Buy 140 Call**\n\n**Sell 135 Call**\n\n**Iron Condors 3/06 - much riskier**\n\n**117/139, 2$ width.**\n\n**There are lofty expectations on OKTA right now and with the given environment, I don\u2019t think they will be satisfied. Profitability remains an issue alongside massive debt.**",

        "selftext": "**$RUN**\n\nThis is what I'm talking about. You see those solar panels in the rich neighborhoods? That's SunRun. It's the perfect company for middle-upper class suburban normies to feel better about their footprint and so all the housewives can tell eachother how green they are. Super foods? Nah. Kale chips? Nah. Solar panels motherfucker. This shit right here:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/TzSjcJA.png\n\nSunRun takes the hard part out of the equation. Their solar panels and batteries are resold Panasonic equipment. Panasonic just canceled their solar panel deal with TSLA, but they're still strong with SunRun:\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/panasonic-drops-out-of-solar-panel-partnership-with-tesla-2020-02-26\n\nPanasonic knows its easier to just pump these mother fuckers out to companies like SunRun than form some \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b partnership with Tesla.\n\nSunrun is in my area (MA) and they're booming, look at this:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/R8FuX7I.png\n\nThey're pumping out offices to sell solar panels to housewives at an extreme rate. It's already all over California. They even formed a partnership with my energy company, and our energy company gives us incentives to go with Sunrun.\n\n**Company Hiring**\n\nLet's focus on their hiring for a second. They're hiring a billion retards for their massive growth:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/AZOAtaF.png\n\n687 Listings on LinkedIn, 500 on indeed, more on their website. Anything from Software Engineers to VPs to marketers, etc.\n\nThey're in the process of expanding their company nationwide and hiring out the yahoo to do so, practically handing out jobs. One of their main issues last year was they couldn't hire enough retards to sell this shit, what kind of company can say that.\n\nOnce a housewife buys this shit, she tells all her friends and they **cuck the fuck out of their husbands to get solar panels too.** Even better SunRun is ran by an empowered super woman. Check out this article showing you how brave and strong she is:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/business/lynn-jurich-sunrun.html\n\n**Earnings**\n\nGood or bad earnings, these guys JUMP insanely on earnings news. Next earnings date is in May.\n\nQ3 2019: Beat EPS by 450%\n\nQ4 2019: Missed EPS but beat Revenue\n\nThis is normal during a hyper-growth stage, more money is being put into company spending, they're also buying back stock, opening new offices, hiring a billion people, etc. It's no worry as revenue did not miss, which is what you'd expect. Plus who the fuck buys solar panels in the winter?\n\nThey are floating **a ton of cash** for a company their size. Their assets are dank AF and show they're getting ready to POP. Don't believe the \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3bthat tried to downplay sunrun last earnings, they have already recovered, eating away all the losses.\n\n**Take a look at any neighborhood near you on Google Satellite, and you'll see just how popular solar panels are getting, its the next big thing. Buy whatever the housewives want, they control their husbands.**\n\n**Volume**\n\nThey have great volume for their size surprisingly. I haven't played the options market with them yet, but it seems like a steady amount of activity, mostly bullish. \n\n**Here is some of their option activity I've seen by major investors** (note this does not guarantee anything):\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/N5XE59B.png\n\n**Recent off the market print @22.47 a share (current $20.22):** (note this doesn't guarantee anything)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/y0SkDWy.png\n\nThat's an 18% volume print.\n\n**Competitors and Similar Companies:**\n\nSunRun is a bit unique, they don't seem to have any competition that is moving this fast, spreading to this many markets, etc. \n\n**One of their main competitors was SolarCity, and SolarCity is dead, and Tesla Solar (solarcity) just lost their Panasonic partnership.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI think SunRun is in a position to greatly grow their company, they're already expanding at a ludicrous rate, hiring as many employees as they can, and emerging in new cities, forming deals with local energy companies for incentives to the buyer, etc. I knew nothing about them until my energy company National Grid sent me information about them. They've mailed pamphlets to all their customers, and in MA we care a lot about sustainable energy (we even get to pick if we want our energy to come from renewable resources).\n\nWith the recent market activity regarding them, it seems that the major investors are waking up to this too. With the recent downside we've seen across the market, they're sitting at a very tolerable price for new investors.\n\nFor options taking into consideration the bullish major investor purchasing, I'd say any March 20 calls ($23,$24,$25,$27,$28) to capitalize on any pop and for an earnings play, you'd want May 20 ($25+). They're pretty cheap you could pick up a few yolos for 20 in tendies.",

Activist\ninvestors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.\nThere is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.\nSchedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management\n(such as Index funds).\n\nThere is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize\nis that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.\nThe reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.\nIn contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.\n\n## New Filings\nThis table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,\nas investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.\n\nDate|Form|Company|Investor|Shares|Ownership|Change\n----|----|-------|--------|-----:|--------:|----:  \n03&amp;#8209;31|13D|[RZLT / Rezolute, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/rzlt)|[HANDOK, INC.](https://fintel.io/i/handok-inc)| 91,300,933|31.1%| \n03&amp;#8209;31|13D|[GFY / Western Asset Variable Rate Strategic Fund Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/gfy)|[Relative Value Partners Group, LLC](https://fintel.io/i/relative-value-partners-group-llc)| 1,435,077|32.12%|2.62 \n03&amp;#8209;31|13D|[BOXL / Boxlight Corporation](https://fintel.io/so/us/boxl)|[K Laser Technology Inc.](https://fintel.io/i/k-laser-technology-inc)| |30.2%| \n03&amp;#8209;30|13D|[NLNK / NewLink Genetics Corp](https://fintel.io/so/us/nlnk)|[Blackstone Holdings II L.P.](https://fintel.io/i/blackstone-holdings-ii)| 468,145|5.6%| \n03&amp;#8209;30|13D|[CVLT / CommVault Systems, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/cvlt)|[Starboard Value LP](https://fintel.io/i/starboard-value-lp)| 4,329,256|9.3%| \n03&amp;#8209;30|13D|[CHEF / Chefs&amp;#x27; Warehouse, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/chef)|[Legion Partners Asset Management, LLC](https://fintel.io/i/legion-partners-asset-management-llc)| 1,666,800|5.5%|15.06 \n03&amp;#8209;30|13D|[ACEL / Accel Entertainment, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/acel)|[Peterson Karl Mr.](https://fintel.io/i/peterson-karl-mr)| 4,295,113|5.39%| \n03&amp;#8209;30|13D|[SCVX / SCVX Corp.](https://fintel.io/so/us/scvx)|[Hudson Bay Capital Management LP](https://fintel.io/i/hudson-bay-capital-management-lp)| 2,371,149|10.3%| \n03&amp;#8209;30|13D|[CSLT / Castlight Health, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/cslt)|[Raging Capital Management, LLC](https://fintel.io/i/raging-capital-management-llc)| 10,423,517|14.0%|52.17 \n03&amp;#8209;30|13D|[PKE / Park Electrochemical Corp.](https://fintel.io/so/us/pke)|[Raging Capital Management, LLC](https://fintel.io/i/raging-capital-management-llc)| 1,262,838|6.2%|-32.61 \n03&amp;#8209;27|13D|[BABB / BAB, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/babb)|[Camelot Event-Driven Advisors LLC](https://fintel.io/i/camelot-event-driven-advisors-llc)| |6.6%| \n03&amp;#8209;27|13D|[CNIG / Corning Natural Gas Holding Corporation](https://fintel.io/so/us/cnig)|[Corning Natural Gas Holding Corp](https://fintel.io/i/corning-natural-gas-holding-corp)| 156,139|5.03%| \n03&amp;#8209;26|13D|[PFMT / Performant Financial Corp](https://fintel.io/so/us/pfmt)|[PRESCOTT GROUP CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.L.C.](https://fintel.io/i/prescott-group-capital-management)| 12,545,261|23.3%|51.30 \n03&amp;#8209;26|13D|[SING / Singlepoint, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/sing)|[Lambrecht Greg Paul](https://fintel.io/i/lambrecht-greg-paul)| 849,723,452|33.6%| \n03&amp;#8209;26|13D|[TCRX / THL Credit, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/tcrx)|[First Eagle Holdings, Inc.](https://fintel.io/i/first-eagle-holdings-inc)| 1,259,102|4.238%| \n03&amp;#8209;26|13D|[EGLT / Egalet Corporation](https://fintel.io/so/us/eglt)|[Assertio Therapeutics, Inc](https://fintel.io/i/assertio-therapeutics-inc)| 4,854,863|51.0%| \n03&amp;#8209;26|13D|[CHRA / Charah Solutions, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/chra)|[Charah Holdings Lp](https://fintel.io/i/charah-holdings)| 24,842,203|63.7%|24.90 \n03&amp;#8209;26|13D|[35471R106 / Franklin Street Properties Corp](https://fintel.io/so/us/35471r106)|[KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc.](https://fintel.io/i/kbs-strategic-opportunity-reit)| 5,879,225|5.5%| \n03&amp;#8209;25|13D|[ASPS / Altisource Portfolio Solutions SA](https://fintel.io/so/lu/asps)|[Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A.](https://fintel.io/i/altisource-portfolio-solutions)| 856,742|5.38%| \n03&amp;#8209;25|13D|[ZYME / Zymeworks Inc](https://fintel.io/so/us/zyme)|[Baker Brothers Advisors LP](https://fintel.io/i/baker-bros-advisors-lp)| 4,862,414|9.99%|0.00 \n03&amp;#8209;24|13D|[WGO / Winnebago Industries, Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/wgo)|[Punch Card Capital, L.P.](https://fintel.io/i/punch-card-capital)| 2,385,740|7.1%| \n03&amp;#8209;24|13D|[IMRA / IMARA Inc.](https://fintel.io/so/us/imra)|[Arix Bioscience Plc](https://fintel.io/i/arix-bioscience)| 1,554,558|9.4%| \n03&amp;#8209;24|13D|[TNRG / Thunder Energies Corp.](https://fintel.io/so/us/tnrg)|[Saveene Corp](https://fintel.io/i/saveene-corp)| 50,000,000|100.0%|\n\n## Amended Filings\nThis table lists amended filings in the last week, and is useful for monitoring changes in existing investments\nor when a fund closes a position.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are expected to see more wild swings, even if Fed makes big policy move  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/stocks-are-expected-to-see-more-wild-swings-even-if-fed-makes-big-policy-move.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday\u2019s 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&amp;P is now 20.2% below its February high.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&amp;P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could say we\u2019re pricing a garden variety recession,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. \u201cWe come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.\u201d She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&amp;P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf [S&amp;P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,\u201d said Calvasina.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we needed to get through this week, in particular \u2014 the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close\u201d to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.\n*****\n&gt; But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.\n*****\n&gt; Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.\n*****\n&gt; As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cIn 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,\u201d said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. \u201cI think something else we\u2019ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed\u2019s policy response that could drive the market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,\u201d Goldman economists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a \u201cpatient\u201d stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&amp;P companies\u2019 balance sheets are in really good shape,\u201d Calvasina said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/iG7ENVB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4gwPTzC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/h9DkOZJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4m2QVZH.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/akOOH97.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/slVwGv2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ASyHg6a.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rbgSrGQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eS99ijc.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tEs62Hh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kMQTBj6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/toentZ2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ozn837y.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Signs Of A Washout?\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index\u2019s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&amp;P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.\n\n&gt; From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.\n\n&gt; Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&amp;P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn\u2019t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market\u2019s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday\u2019s sell-off left less 6% of the S&amp;P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. \u201cThese are truly frightening times,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Signs_of_Washout.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Fastest Bear Market Ever\n\n&gt; The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Not to be outdone, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&amp;P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMarkets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.\u201d\n\n&gt; Last, one of Warren Buffett\u2019s most famous quotes is, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.\u201d We\u2019ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear &amp; Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning\u2019s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines\n\n&gt; Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.\n\n&gt; First of all yes, this time is different \u2013 and yet it\u2019s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market\u2019s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it\u2019s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.\n\n&gt; Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It\u2019s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31cca506c45d87ad962ce9c707baf21a/fc7021573b50880b-76/s500x750/0a6588971f599cbbca194b38b62a47c087875238.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover &amp; End Losing Friday Streak\n\n&gt; Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 &amp; 144 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday\u2019s have been weaker in bear markets.\n\n&gt; However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.\n\n &gt; In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8d6237984423d89dc5b20f4a1bf7009/07327bf517318c16-1e/s500x750/13020ac23c0adf1831e35c982c37f1602a236fd1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages\n\n&gt; The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&amp;P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**\n\n&gt; The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Above-200-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.\n\n&gt; What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/raymktcap.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging\n\n&gt; Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**\n\n&gt; Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble.

The world as we know it is ending, the rules for investing have changed, the paradigm has shifted, etc.... and we're all F'd. Yesterday the volume was huge and everything was getting kicked to the curb, in all categories, even gold and crypto. That's the definition of panic. Throwing out the babies with the bathwater. I was sitting on cash but putting it to work now. Started buying in at -15% and have been cost average buying every 5% pts down. I'm about 2/3's done. Bought heavily at the close yesterday and wanted to puke the whole time and my inner dialogue was telling me what a moron I am. Yesterday had all the symptoms of capitulation when we were down 27% peak to trough, but I think we'll end up down 30-35% all totaled before this is over, so there will be plenty of buy opportunities over the next few weeks. From there we may bounce around in a short lived bear market that traders will like. Not quite the existential financial crisis of 2008 but close. Loading up on MSFT, DIS, CSCO, AAPL, BAC, CVS, SBUX, MA, VZ, T, MU, STX, NKE etc... and plan to hold for 10+ year timeline.
