(NYSE: WORK), the most innovative enterprise communications platform, have entered into a definitive agreement under which Salesforce will acquire Slack. Under the terms of the agreement, Slack shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock for each Slack share, representing an enterprise value of approximately $27.7 billion based on the closing price of Salesforce\u2019s common stock on November 30, 2020.\n\n&gt; The board of directors of each of Salesforce and Slack have approved the transaction and the Slack board recommends that Slack stockholders approve the transaction and adopt the merger agreement. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of Salesforce\u2019s fiscal year 2022, subject to approval by the Slack stockholders, the receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.",

        "selftext": "**Basics**\n\nSalesforce is a San Fransisco company that offers **C**ustomer **R**elation **M**anagement software (and hence the symbol CRM). It's not a  joke company like many other shilled on WSB. Salesforce has a market cap of $200 billion and is one of the 30 companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\n**What Happened**\n\nThis is the price chart for Salesforce (CRM) last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9sqm4nur2a361.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e71b4aee8595c1e3a5a2f1220fedc017c21153f2\n\nThe sharp drop happened right after the earning call. Was the earnings number disappointing? No, in fact, it was stellar. While the average expected EPS was $0.75 per share, the actual number turned out to be $1.74.\n\nBut Salesforce also announced that it's in the process of acquiring Slack (WORK) for 27.7 billion dollars. Some experts said Salesforce is overpaying for Slack and a huge sell-off followed, resulting in a 40 billion drop in Salesforce market cap.\n\nSo, think about it. Salesforce acquires a company for 27.7 billion and its market cap goes down by 40 billion. In other words, 2+2=3, while usually with a merger you expect 2+2=5.\n\n**What Happened Next**\n\nAfter the initial shock, analysts and the public started to reassess the situation, and many actually praised the acquisition.\n\nJim Cramer (the guy who is the WSB for boomers) [said \"Salesforce Has 100% Upside After Buying Slack\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-salesforce-100-upside-173302345.html). He's been shilling the stock on his show every day as well.\n\nMultiple analysts upgraded their Salesforce recommendation to Strong Buy and raised their price target.\n\nSince then, the initial price gap has been filled a little. The price is currently about $226. But a full recovery to pre-EC prices ($240s) and higher seems imminent.\n\nTraders have a \"3-Day Rule\" according to which they don't touch a stock that has fallen sharply and suddenly for 3 days to let it sink to its lowest and see where it goes from there. Those 3 days for CRM are passed and it seems to be rising.\n\n**What's Coming**\n\n[Salesforce Investor day](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Investor-Day-2020/default.aspx) is on Tuesday (Dec 8) in the morning. They will probably clarify the necessity of the slack acquisition and their plans to profitably integrate it into their core business.\n\nAlso, a lot of institutions see this drop as a good opportunity to get in, so the demand is high.\n\n**What Positions**\n\nDo NOT buy weekly or far OTM options. Consider the following (ranked from riskiest to safest):\n\n\\- 230C 12/18/2020\n\n\\- 250C End of year-February\n\n\\- 270C March-May 2021\n\n\\- 300C June-July 2021\n\n\\- The stock (CRM) if you want to hold for 6 months or more.\n\n**When to Buy**\n\nDo not FOMO. I don't want you to buy in pre-market or when it starts high on Monday and then curse my name when it goes down some in 2 hours.\n\nI think this will certainly go up, both short term and long term,  but there will be dips along the way. Wait for the dips to buy in.",

        "selftext": "**Tesla and NIO shares are jumping after good news, while NIKOLA tumbles after GM goes for a much smaller agreement, the stock market loses ground as investors take profits, let\u2019s talk about this and much more about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.\n\nAlmost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)\n\nEnergy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.\n\nHere are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company\u2019s future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)\n\nGreat news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it\u2019s GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.\n\nAlso, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it\u2019s shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.\n\nAlso relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.\n\nWhile the hydrogen power Nikola seen it\u2019s share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock\u2026 So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.\n\nGood news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.\n\nOther great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe\u2019s, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.\n\nWhile on the vaccine front, Moderna\u2019s candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it\u2019s head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they\u2019re first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.\n\nThe only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.\n\nMeanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn\u2019t gone to far to the left.\n\nSo I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great and see you next time!",

Monday was difficult because most stocks on the list were up 4-5%. Here are my current positions and plan for each of them. It's important to have an idea of what you want to do with your positions. If you aren't comfortable holding something at it's current price point then its time to re-adjust your positions.\n\nI had great gains Tuesday by market close, which got blasted yesterday, and up yet again today. Beauty of this all is by selling these puts I dont mind getting assigned, but I'm also collecting premium on theta while the market decides to play chop with itself.\n\n# Positions\n\n**CRM:** This was from last week's earnings YOLO. Looks like I will be assigned tomorrow around $221 level. My break-even price for the shares when I get assigned will be around $225. I can sell the $225 covered call next week and collect a decent premium, maybe 1%. I'm not worried about this position.\n\n**DKNG**: From my plans this week DKNG was looking at a great target to sell puts at. Currently up 25%, I will close the position once it hits 60% profit.\n\n**FROG**: Honestly, I don't know much about this company. I saw it dropped a decent amount from the highs recently so I sold some puts. This one is kind of a YOLO but premiums were incredible.\n\n**PLTR**: Opened this position yesterday even though it wasn't on my list. It was down a good amount yesterday so I saw an opportunity to sell puts here and collect some premium.\n\n**RKT**: This one has gone according to plan. $20 level is like a brick wall for this stock, I view selling puts around that level to be nearly free money (nothing is ever free). It's up a good amount here, I'll continue to hold to get a bit more out of it.\n\n**SFIX**: This was my earnings YOLO this week and I hit smack on the nose. Stock soared 50% on earnings WTF.\n\n**TDOC**: Teledoc is going to be a good long-term hold and something I will continue to sell puts against. Profit has been slow and steady on this one, but will close out around 60% profit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmqyx4fn2f461.png?width=780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14924423b695aa9d4fb99f3d3f1ee4936cc48f8c",

        "selftext": "This one is quick since the CRM alert, don\u2019t expect them this often. For those of you who missed the CRM Calls purchase point Wednesday morning and know what the fuck you are doing, I think writing the shit out CRM Puts is still a money move. But I suppose some people might want a cheaper call premium play, with less news and shit, and most you fucking idiots need all the help you can get. \n\nBBY is another strong options play, I\u2019ll be looking to purchase early next week based on futures and overall market sentiment. But another drop today closed the deal for me. Sticking with ATM calls due to low cost, and we could definitely fall into the 95 range briefly. \n\nWeekly puts are incredibly cheap, consider mildly protecting your call position over the next two weeks if investing significant equity (sell them fast though!). But this decline is undoubtedly near an end and this bitch is turning around shortly for a couple of reasons. \nDon\u2019t get too technical about the purchase point, current market value is solid as it is. \n\nFirst off I don\u2019t like this company in terms of a long term prospect, given the Covid sales bump combined with the vaccine news, but cases are worse then they\u2019ve ever been. Essentially a 9/11 every couple of days.. So that\u2019s good for this one I guess... but as I will probably explain every time, when I give these alerts I\u2019m telling you the price will move upwards enough within the expiration date to exceed theta, but I don\u2019t provide sell points. \n\nFirst thing first, the boys at Best Buy are doing a good old fashioned buyback this quarter, so that helps make things guaranteed. We are down well below short moving averages and at our five year moving averages for those of you that give a shit. \n\nThe company has been performing exceptionally during quarantine and has a strong bottom line (Yes I know it went down a bit due to logistical costs of online sales). We will definitely see some positive growth over the next month or two, and it\u2019s another clear example of a stock that is being majorly oversold post earnings. \n\nIf you start typing under the impression I think BBY is going to fly to 125 in two weeks you\u2019re a fucking idiot. Don\u2019t bag hold dumb fucks, especially if you buy OTM calls. \n\nDon\u2019t think writing puts is an awful strategy on this one either, but think CRM is still better, and you can soak up way more premium with its current IV and volume.",

At this point im not expecting any ipos to be cheap just purely based on the hype were seeing right now. But here is just a DD i did for it. The company has **an interesting business model in which that the company will partner up with another company to create an application that is proven to increase efficiency, reduce cost, track measurements for analysis purposes and so on and will then proceed to sell the same implementation to other companies that may benefit from the applications**. The revenue is mainly based on the subscription models to create steady stream of revenue. The company is lead by Tom Siebel, the pioneer of the customer relationship management software business that sold his company to Oracle for 6 billion in 2006 and C3.AI is his next level creation to revolutionize the world. **C3.AI is listed as one of the top disruptors of 2020 is backed up by Microsoft and spring creek capital with 50 million of stocks and $ 100 million investment respectively. C3.AI announced the partnership with Raytheon Technologies to develop AI solutions for aerospace and defense missions for government customers, including the U.S. Air Force and intelligence community. They also announced partnership with Microsoft and Adobe for a new customer \u2013 relationship management software seeking to comeback Salesforce INC.** The potential **for C3.AI is limitless because of how broad the scope can be. With a successful implementation of an application, C3.AI could easily spin it off to implement such applications to other industries with incredible scalability and tremendous reduction to developing cost**. Before we dive into what the company actually does, here is the overview of the company. \n\n**Financial wise, the company has**\n\n\\- **A whopping 71% yoy growth**\n\n\\- **86% subscription revenue**\n\n\\- **A $271 billion TAM by 2024.** \n\n\\- **Narrowing income loss thanks to the rapid growth**\n\n**The AI technology is a proven technology and is one that is being used daily to help industries moving faster into digital transformation. The currently capability and usage of the AI software is as followed** \n\n\\- **Make 1.1Billion predictions per day**\n\n\\- **Has 4.8million machine learning models in production use**\n\n\\- **Has 622 million sensors generating data for the C3.AI suite**\n\n\\- **Has 770 unique enterprise and extraprise source data integration** \n\n\\- **Has 50 Million businesses and consumers touched daily**\n\n**Notable market successes:**\n\n\\- **Banks are able to enhance securities lending optimization with estimated value of 14 billion in additional daily trades deployed in 52 weeks**\n\n\\- **Healthcare managements are able to enhance production optimization with estimated value of 300% increase in unit production deployed in 4 weeks**\n\n\\- **Oil and gas companies are able to predictive maintenance for offshore oil rigs and is able to recapture $28million per year in avoided shutdowns** \n\nWhat is C3.AI\n\nC3.ai is an enterprise AI software company that provides software as a service, applications that enable the rapid deployment of enterprise AI applications of extraordinary scale and complexity that offer significant social and economic benefit. \n\n**Two primary software solutions:**\n\n**1.** **C3 AI suite: designed to allow customers to apply design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI application to any type (basically a platform that allows you to develop your own applications)**\n\n**2.** **C3 AI Application: include a large and growing family of industry specific and application specific turnkey Ai solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed (a prebuilt application that is ready to go for implementations)**\n\nThe market entry growth strategy of C3.AI is focus on partnering and coordinating with lighthouse customers (the big companies including AWS, Baker Huges, FIS, Google, IBM and Microsoft) to create a proven and scalable applications that work to increase efficiency, cut down on costs and to record measurements on a massive scale for analysis purposes. With the established applications. \n\n**C3.AI is then able to** \n\n**1.** **Expand those same use cases across similar companies**\n\n**2.** **Establish middle market sales organizations, including tele sales, and online sales**\n\n**3.** **Leverage on marketing partners as enterprise and mid-market distribution channels**\n\nReal world user case:\n\nEngie \u2013 largest power producer in the world with\n\n\\- 114.4 GW power production capacity\n\n\\- $67 billion annual revenue in europoors money\n\n\\- 153k employees, operated in 70 counties \n\nWith the partnership with Engie, C3.Ai developed and deployed performance optimization for gas power plants, efficiency optimization of heating and cooling plants, energy analysis and management for enterprise and consumer customers, and anomaly detection of wind turbines. **C3 was able to bring the scalability required to build industrial AI based application with over 1million sensors, 5 million end points and 17mil measurements per day with the end result of bringing estimated 1.5 billion in annual economic benefits**\n\n\\- Wind turbines with in 12 weeks of deployment sees 2-3% increase in performance resulting in 15-22Mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Heating and cooling plants see 2-3% saving in energy consumption costs with $3mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Application in analyze energy for metered facility on the Ohio State university campus and is expected to see 25% energy saving within 10 years within 16 weeks of deployment \n\n\\- Application to analyze and forecast consumption for electricity and gas retail customers in France of 2.6Mil electricity consumers and 8.6mil has consumers with deployment of 6 months \n\n**Revenue model**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of the C3.AI Suite**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of C3.AI applications**\n\n\\- **Monthly runtime fee of C3 AI Applications and customer-developed application built using the C3.AI suite, usage based upon CPU- hour consumption**\n\n\\- **Professional services fees associated with training and assisting customers**\n\nIn the case of Engie, C3.AI would be making money from subscriptions to C3.AI suite and applications, setting up required trackers for measurements, developing AI applications, a monthly runtime fee if Engie is continuing to develop new applications with C3.AI. With the proven applications and set up, C3.AI then would be able to sell them to other companies that could also benefit from same implementation. **With Biden focusing on green energy infrastructures, one could expect the demand of the applications to increase.**\n\nTheir AI has also been used in sectors like utilities, banking, aerospace &amp; defense, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, smart cities, and transportation. **With already proven and prebuilt applications listed below that could be implemented into broader and more general sector.** \n\n\\- **Anti-money laundering**\n\n\\- **COVID-19 Data lake**\n\n\\- **AI CRM**\n\n\\- **Energy management**\n\n\\- **Fraud detection**\n\n\\- **Inventory optimization**\n\n\\- **Predictive maintenance**\n\n\\- **Production schedule optimization**\n\n\\- **Readiness**\n\n\\- **Sensor health**\n\n\\- **Supply network risk** \n\n**As C3.Ai continues to work with various more different sectors to create more applications, C3.AI will be able to reach into more boarder market. With already established applications in various broad sectors, C3.AI is going to take AI to the next level by focusing on deep penetration into business solutions, aerospace and defense with the partnership with Microsoft, Adobe and Raytheon Technologies to fully dominate the sectors.** \n\n **TLDR:** \n\n**There is none cause im too lazy to type one.**",

        "selftext": "Currently allocating the majority of my portfolio to SPACs as they\u2019ve been paying up well lately! Here\u2019s a list with concise commentary (concise because I don\u2019t enter into details of DD, but comment/ask away):\n\n- DMYD - world\u2019s 2nd largest supplier of data for online gambling/betting companies. This industry is growing fast and steady\u2026it is very hot atm, but imo is being shadowed by speculative industries like EV/Autonomous driving/AI. When more people realize this industry is a sure thing, I expect healthy returns!\n\n- THCB - maker of EV batteries, there\u2019s rumors they\u2019ll be supplying Tesla, read somewhere they\u2019re preparing to build facilities right next to Tesla\u2019s future production site in Germany. To me this is a pure speculative play, if the rumors get confirmed I\u2019d expect the stock to double from current levels of 15-17$. NOTE: they have an unbinding letter of intent to merge, not yet a done deal, or else I suspect the stock would already be past 20$ based on those rumors.\n\n- ROCH - this company has exclusive rights to use a patented methodology to recycle plastics. The patent owner is P&amp;G (Procter &amp; Gamble). What really turned my head was that the company is backed by P&amp;G, L\u2019Oreal, Total, and some other mammoths\u2026while being priced fairly cheap with lots of upside potential, this is an investment worth looking at!\n\n- GHIV - large mortgage seller with huge recent growth, plus expected further growth in the near future. What triggered my attention is that the company is already committed to paying dividends even before going public (to me this is unheard of\u2026we\u2019ve all gotten used to companies that lose money\u2026and here\u2019s one that\u2019s not only profitable it\u2019s also ready to pay dividends right away!)\n\n- BFT - fintech business, like a smaller version of Stripe. Think this was a record breaking SPAC that priced the company at 9b pro forma. The whole online payments/banking is hot atm, I don\u2019t expect this business to ever compete with PayPal but if it keeps growing as it is, it\u2019ll definitely be acquired (and we all know how acquisitions pay off! Salesforce just bought Slack for 28b, it was half that a week before the offer!)\n\n- STPK - battery optimization AI. It\u2019s complex stuff I couldn\u2019t bother to fully understand, but ticks all the boxes for the current speculative market\u2026so I got a small position because we all know the current market isn\u2019t too worried with fundamentals, it\u2019s more concerned with keywords.\n\n- PSTH and IPOF - both don\u2019t have a target to merge yet, but both have lots of potential! PSTH is  a 4b SPAC lead by Bill Ackman, and the latter is the largest SPAC (1.6b) from a series of successful deals by Social Capital Hedosophia. I expect at least one of these to eventually catch a huge fish, like Sportradar, Stripe or even Bloomberg!\n\nAlso LAZR I bought as a SPAC (GMHI) for 15$. I think the CEO is going far\u2026 people like him have the potential to become the next Elon Musks, Mark Zuckerbergs or Bill Gates. It may still be early to call, but from his track record I\u2019m very optimistic. I mean he started the company at 17, dropped out of Stanford, is backed by Peter Thiel, is a billionaire at age 25, seems obsessed in his mission to develop, improve and deliver\u2026in time we will see.",

        "selftext": "**SALESFORCE CRUSHES EARNINGS AND ACQUIRES SLACK, NIKOLA STOCK CONTINUES TO TUMBLE AS WE FINALLY GET THE FIRST VACCINE APPROVAL IN THE UK, LET\u2019S DISCUSS THIS AND MORE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET**\n\nHey everyone! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.\n\nOver 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)\n\nThe biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)\n\nHere are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.\n\nWhile [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.\n\nThis news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.\n\nWell yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.\n\nOn the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.\n\nThe company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.\n\nSlack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.\n\nWe also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.\n\nWhile on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.\n\nBut we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.\n\nThe biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don\u2019t disappoint.\n\nI greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "SalesForce ($CRM) is a business that I have used and admired for awhile now. I think Marc Benioff is a great innovative CEO. They have great financials, growth, and a wide competitive moat. I've wanted to own them for awhile but the price seemed to high for what I typically buy.  \n\n\nI actually do like their acquisition of Slack. Wall street seems to think they overpaid and has punished them, down more than 10% on the news and 20% in the last 2 weeks, despite a very strong quarter. Overall their growth is incredibly strong, their margins are 80%, and although $200B valuation seems insane, if they continue their current growth and build out their CRM, and businesses like Tableau and Slack, they could more than justify it and catch up to the rest of the cloud kings.  \n\n\nWhat are people's thoughts on the acquisition and CRM's current price?",

        "selftext": "The last several week I've been posting my plays by selling cash-secured-puts and also buying shares. I thought maybe you guys here at r/StockMarket might appreciate this post. This week I closed up roughly $1,500 which was about 2% of the buying power I used for my plays. The market performed the same, so all in all was a pretty solid week and am happy with the positions I entered, the ones I closed, and also the ones I still have open.\n\nI get a lot of messages from people asking me when do I sell my position if it goes against me? When should I sell to take profit? When a position goes against me I will try to roll it out to a further down strike price and further out expiration date. I will usually do this only once, if I feel it. Otherwise I will just take assignment. As for taking profits, if I get a quick 60% in just a day or two, I will close and look for a better opportunity.\n\nAs an example, here are my positions I screen-shotted mid-week when I was getting absolutely hammered, and screen-shotted again Friday afternoon just before closing some out. You can see the positions are all the same, I wasn't stressed about having a red week since I was something like 16 wins out of 16 plays going into this week. Looks like I'll keep the win streak going for now. CRM is my only position looking contested right now.\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n# Here's a few things regarding my strategy\n\n**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.\n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling and shares!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**CRM:** This was an earnings YOLO that went against me. I sold the $230 strike and the stock dropped from $240 to $220 after earnings. This play expires next week so if the stock price gets a pop back over $230 I will most likely be able to close at 50% profit. Similarly if it goes down I will most likely be getting assigned. This option will be extremely volatile since it's close to being ATM and also expires this week.\n\n**PLTR:** This ticker wasn't on my watchlist last week, but when I saw it trading down 10% the other day I had to sell some puts. IV was/is incredibly high so I have almost a 15% return I am collecting through premium. My plays expire end of December, but are already in the green.\n\n**TDOC:** I'm expecting this to continue it's uptrend and I don't believe my strike will get contested, but you never know. I will hold this until closer to expiration or if I get to 80%+ profit.\n\n# Master Plays This Week\n\nI've added a range of tickers with lower stock prices that I'm watching so you folks with smaller accounts can look at some options as well.\n\n**FROG ($68)**\n\n[Frog Chart](https://imgur.com/ZGeQ1YM)\n\nI can't say I know much about FROG (Frog LTD), but I do know they have super high IV and premiums are verrrry nice. The stock was trading down 30% from the October highs, but has caught some momentum recently and is up 10% from the lows. Chart is still really new and trends are difficult to identify. I like the risk to reward selling a $60 put at the support line where it's bounced off of multiple times.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Jan 15, 2021 $60 put for $3.50 or $350 premium. Return: 5.8%. Break-even share price: $56.50.\n2. Shares with price target $71-75\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DKNG ($49)**\n\n[DKNG chart](https://imgur.com/TpyFbai)\n\nDKNG has been bouncing around with no clear direction. Trend is still up and has some support in the lower to mid $40s and a very strong support at $36, but that would be a 30% drop from here. In my opinion any dip into $45 will be bought. I like this ticker for long-term as well.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Dec 31, 2020 $45 put for $1.80 or $180 premium. Return: 4.0%. Break-even share price: $43.20\n2. Shares with price target $50+\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CRSR ($35)**\n\n[CRSR chart](https://imgur.com/uyV19xh)\n\nCRSR chart has gone up and up since IPO. It has a huge breakout 2 weeks ago with an even quicker reversal last week. After the sharp reversal to the downside I like the entry point with selling some January 15 puts at the $25 strike. To lose on this position the stock would need to drop another 35% from current levels.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Jan 15, 2021 $25 put for $1.00 or $100 premium. Return: 4.0%. Break-even share price: $24.00\n2. Shares with price target $37-40\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SFIX ($35) - Earnings YOLO**\n\n[SFIX chart](https://imgur.com/bpsUizB)\n\nSFIX has been on an uptrend without merit. Revenues and profitability have been on the decline since covid. They tanked hard on their last 3 earnings on lackluster performance and dropped 15% on the last earnings report alone. Not good. For that reason IV and premiums are super high for next week's earnings report, Tuesday after market close. Normally I would say this chart is super over-extended, but the stock just dropped 20% last week. I like the level it's currently at to sell some puts for earnings here.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Dec 18, 2020 $32 put for $1.60 or $160 premium. Return: 5.0%. Break-even share price: $30.40\n2. I don't recommend shares for this as since the stock is super volatile and can swing in any direction. I prefer selling puts and getting assigned the shares at another 10% discount, if it gets there. Otherwise I collect 5% return on premium in just 2 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PLTR (23$)**\n\n[PLTR chart](https://imgur.com/54xJ6Yx)\n\nPLTR is similar to CRSR where the chart is too new to identify trends. The stock recent tripled before coming back down to earth. Currently sitting at around $23-24. We might see it come back down to $18, but I like the entry point here selling some puts 3-4 weeks out.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Jan 8, 2021 $20 put for $1.50 or $150 premium. Return: 7.5%. Break-even share price: $18.50.\n2. I also like the entry here for a long-term hold. Shares could have a great return in the next 6 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RKT ($19)**\n\n[RKT chart](https://imgur.com/meQRjq8)\n\nRKT was on my list last week, but for some reason my post missed the chart and description. I added it again here. This ticker has been consolidating for 3 months just looking to explode to the upside. $20 has been a magnet recently and doesn't stray too far from the price. IV is also quite high for this name and can provide some good return. I'll be selling strikes below the $20.\n\n**Positions I'm Watching:**\n\n1. Dec 31, 2020 $19 put for $0.95 or $95 premium. Return: 5.05%. Break-even share price $18.05.\n2. Similar to PLTR I see good long-term return here for shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Last week's positions](https://imgur.com/NUNuXq0)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 2, 2020**\n\nThe market rallied throughout the session after opening in the red, with the indexes holding near-record levels, with market participants optimistic that the approval and distribution of a vaccine could come relatively soon. Coronavirus cases in the United States are still on the rise, unfortunately. \n\nIn recent weeks, investors have been cheering positive vaccine developments from companies like Pfizer (PFE), Moderna (MRNA), and AstraZeneca (AZN), fueling optimism that distribution of an effective medical solution for COVID-19 is coming relatively soon. Moderna and Pfizer have already submitted their vaccines to European and American health administrations for emergency use authorization. According to CBS News, during a conference call, Vice President Mike Pence told state governors that distribution of a vaccine could begin as early as mid-December. According to audio obtained by CBS News, Vice Presiden Pence said, \u201cWe strongly believe the vaccine distribution process could begin as soon as the week of December 14. With the news that Moderna is joining Pfizer in submitting for emergency use authorization, we continue to be on pace.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the number of patients hospitalized with COVID set another record, with the Center of Disease Control (CDC) Director warning of difficult times ahead if the curve is not flattened again soon. As of yesterday, there are more than 98,000 people hospitalized, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Hospital systems across the nations are warning they are reaching capacity and are lacking resources. In response, Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC warned, \"The reality is, December and January and February are going to be rough times. I actually believe they're going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that's going to be put on our health care system.\u201d\n\nYesterday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a new $908 billion targeted stimulus. The lawmakers say their plan aims to find common ground on some of the most pressing issues, and it could be used as a framework for the next stimulus package. The bill includes money for local and state governments, additional business protections, and to fund vaccine research and distribution. House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have both supported the bill. It is unlikely any sort of bill will pass through Congress but we will keep you updated surrounding this situation.\n\nHighlights\n\n* The UK became the first country to approve Pfizer\u2019s (PFE) coronavirus vaccine.\n* Salesforce (CRM) fell more than 9% after the company announced it would be purchasing workplace messaging software company Slack (WORK) in its largest-ever deal valued at $27.7 billion, confirming a week\u2019s worth of media reports over the tie-up. The announcement coincided with Salesforce\u2019s third-quarter earnings results, which topped estimates, though its fourth-quarter profit guidance disappointed.\n* United Parcel Service (UPS) was forced to impose shipping restrictions on some large retailers such as Gap Inc. and Nike Inc. this week, an early sign that the pandemic-fueled online shopping season is stretching delivery networks to their limits. UPS is metering the flow of packages into its network to preserve its performance during one of the busiest shipping weeks of the year. \n   * Fedex (FDX) has followed suit to an extent by increasing shipping prices and holding merchants to volume agreements\n* Alphabet (GOOG) announced the acquisition of Actifo, a company that specializes in data back-up and recovery in the event of a disaster\n* Salesforce (CRM) target increase by JMP Securities from $272 to $282 at OUTPERFORM\n* Fate Therapeutics (FATE) target raised by Barclays from $60 to $70 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $61.\n* NetApp (NTAP) target raised by Credit Suisse from $54 to $64 at OUTPERFORM. Stock gained 10% for the day to close at $59\n* Peleton (PTON) target raised by Needham &amp; Co. from $125 to $140 at BUY. Stock rallied to $117 intra day and closed even at $112\n* Red Rock Resorts $RRR target raised by Macquarie from $28 to $30. Stock currently around $22\n* Suncor $SU target raised by Barclays from $29 to $31. Very notable because stock only around $16.\n* UnitedHealth Group $UNH with multiple target bullish price target increases from notable analysts. Average price target around $375 and rating of OVERWEIGHT\n* Children\u2019s Place (PLCE) was up almost 8% on the day after Wedbush increased price target to $48 from $32 yesterday\n\n\"If your dreams don't scare you, they are too small\" -Richard Branson",

The market sentiment was weak this week because of the SaaS sector earnings risks and the desire of hedge funds to get in cheaper for a second December rally. HOHOHO.\n\nSalesforce got hammered to create enough delta for a gap up back to $250+ for accumilation. \n\nSnowflake couldn't stay down and its valuation is absurd, approxiamtely the size of IBM.\n\nPalantir will retest $30 and breakout, just because SNOW did.

The WFH shift is becoming more prevalent as time goes by. People will find new freedom and better quality of life. This continues to be good news for Salesforce+Slack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMorgan Stanley upgraded Slack. It says the deal is at full valuation. The deal is expected to close by July 31, 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSalesforce sets a new long-term sales target at its annual investor day. It now aims to reach more than $50B in revenue in FY26 -- up from a pre-M&amp;A target of up to $35B for FY24.\u00a0Sales for FY20 at $17B. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt looks like CRM will more than double it's value within 5 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Shopping**\n\n* Tableau. $15.7B.

Exactly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBTW, Microsoft may have helped Benioff to get Slack for cheap. WORK was a pandemic stock with a solid product and real revenue, and still, they managed to miss the insane valuations that others got due to Microsoft's hard reaction (scared?) and frankly bad PR from Slack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now What?**\n\nWhat do I know. But all future indicators and past performance point to major tendies. CRM price targets paint a great story for 2021. Salesforce was in a major upward trend before the Slack acquisition announcement. Benioff has demonstrated to be a great dealmaker. The Slack acquisition reinforces Salesforce's intention to dominate the enterprise software landscape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know that \"stonks only go up\", but did you know that Salesforce is part of the Dow as of Aug 2020 and belongs to the S&amp;P 500? Who do you think will prop the them up going forward? You got it right, Sales fucking force dot com.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTD;LR: Not gonna tell you what to do, but I have 250 CRM and 500 WORK shares. 5x 1/08 $225C, and 1x 12/18 $230C. Planning to load up on calls once the upward trend becomes clear (to avoid getting wiped out, yes I'm being conservative, but my Slack play paid out well).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever you do, please be careful with way OTM calls and short expiration. A lot of people were burned by WORK because of that. Salesforce is a $200B company that is not a meme stock; for options, it moves slowly until it doesn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR^(2): CRM + WORK = \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": " SNOWflake earnings come out today! Regardless of results, I want to try explaining what SNOW does in layman's terminology so everyone can have an understanding.\n\nI work at a Fortune 100 company, leading a tech team. I've seen a lot of companies start investing in SNOWflake to scale their digital and analytical capabilities. Here's a summary of what they do:\n\n\u00b7 Snowflake solves for a really important problem in Corporate America's IT, where IT is constantly under pressure to deliver the most value with the least amount of work. \n\n\u00b7 Here's an analogy for what SNOW does - imagine you had important customer data that will allow you to figure out who are the most profitable customers (so you can tell your sales reps to focus on those leads first). However, that data is spread amongst multiple tables in different file formats such as Word, Excel, and PDF. You need a simple way to consolidate that data in order to make sense out of it. SNOW enables that - we can take data from multiple sources such as big cloud platforms like Amazon web services and Microsoft, and combine it with internal on-premise data so we can have one consolidated structured / semi-structured data set so all your data scientists can understand how one data point (e.g., age, education level) correlates with profitability.\n\nThis is why [salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com/) and Warren Buffet invested in SNOW, because SNOW makes life easy, enable all the analytics that corporations are looking for, and allows partners like Salesforce to overcome any internal IT resource constraints that they are selling their services to. The buzzwords you all hear about from Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, are all reliant on having the right data infrastructure in place. Regardless of how earnings today, this is a long term play if you believe that all corporations are investing in this space. Earnings come out today! \n\nHope this helps, I'm curious if others have better analogies or simpler ways to explain the business!",

The grid you\u2019re currently on is using technology that was developed in the 1920s. You gotta build these lines from the source plant to the homes and a significant amount of electricity will be lost in transit. On top of this, the infrastructure has been criminally neglected since 80s in the USA and elsewhere. Do you think these things are maintained? Of course somebody is maintaining them isn\u2019t it? Nope (only superficially). The California fires that PG&amp;E plead guilty to, that killed about a hundred people in 2018 were a testament to the current state of maintenance that goes on. Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html)\n\nTesla is building a future where micro grids and macro grids would trade electricity. Imagine your neighborhood with solar on each roof and battery storage in each house. You\u2019ll be trading amongst yourself (neighborhood). And your neighborhood will be trading electricity with the macro grid. This is only possible with a cutting-edge AI powered software. Tesla is building it. Welcome to the glimpse of the future. This is how it will be everywhere. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) **Develop Grid Level Battery Storage**  **\u2013** In the future the majority of the energy will be obtained from Sun (think of this like indirect fusion source. Sun is a giant fusion reactor in the sky and you\u2019ll be tapping into a microscopic percentage of energy that Sun is sending towards Earth. This microscopic percentage is enough to run the entire civilization which you think utilizes gigantic amount of energy. Everything is relative. So what you\u2019re really consuming globally is laughable at the relative scale of energy Sun is sending towards your planet. \n\nSince Sun doesn\u2019t shine at night, and sometimes it\u2019s cloudy, you gotta build battery farms to store energy for night. Nothing too complicated conceptually. Tesla is building products known as Megapacks that on the face of it beat Peaker Plants that are powered by fossils in terms of cost, space required, and efficiency. The energy industry is all about cost, so Tesla has won. This revolution has just begun. Testament to Tesla\u2019s supreme product is Australia which decided to double Tesla\u2019s battery farm in terms of capacity because it saved them so many millions. The technology has been proven and Tesla is now getting contracts bigger than the previous ones every year. For instance PG&amp;E is currently building the largest battery farm in the US using Tesla\u2019s Megapacks. This part of their business is going to be equal to auto business within this decade. Future is now, old man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) **Develop consumer/business level battery storage \u2013** You need to have localized power generation and storage as well as grid level. This is the future. For instance, when all 2 billion of the vehicles (as of today) go electric in 30 years, the global electricity requirement is going to double. DOUBLE. So you gotta have localized storage and production. When you\u2019ll buy a new house, a significant part of the cost will be the local storage battery plant. You wouldn\u2019t buy a house that doesn\u2019t have its own plant. Tesla is building something known as Tesla Powerwalls. Again, the leading product in its segment, to address this market that has barely begun to develop. This is the future. \n\n4) **Develop solar panels and solar roofs \u2013** Cost of manufacturing solar panels at this point is the cost of doing dry walls. It\u2019s really cheap and Tesla will ride down the cost curve and be able to compete with Chinese subsidy-fuelled solar panel cost decline. This is because Tesla will be building the solar panels locally in different continents and that would trump over the logistics cost addition of importing from China. So it\u2019s up to you whether you wanna import from China or get the entire package from Tesla. Barely any difference in cost would exist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe solar roofs do not have competition. This market does not exist. This is a very difficult product to manufacture but every rich person would get it on their roof and eventually everyone. Initially the spurt growth would come from the large builders who\u2019d be ordering en masse for large-scale projects as well as rich people. Tesla has come out with one design, soon there will be 4 and that\u2019s that. Tesla will dominate this market which they\u2019re building from scratch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Develop company OS for running the entire company from factory to sales. (They don't use Salesforce, etc.)** **-** So you thought Tesla was using Salesforce? ;) Did you think Tesla was able to achieve the profitability and the margins and the customer satisfaction that they did with the help of Salesforce? ;) For anybody aware of the B2B software, you know how big of a deal this is. Using an industry software that\u2019s the standard prevents you from iterating quickly over your business processes. You become a slave to the features that exist in these Salesforce like software. Tesla studied all of this in 2012, and gave a public remark that you can still find, that the industry standard software would not be sufficient. They have finally realized their goal of Tesla Company OS. They run everything from factories to sales on this software. They run literally everything that Tesla does on this. This is something that other companies cannot even conceptualize to make because it\u2019s laughable generally to even think something like \u201cwe\u2019re gonna make our own business software\u201d. Imagine GM thinking this. On top of this, this Tesla Company OS engineering team is badass and they quickly iterate and add new feature and process whenever required. THIS IS THE REASON TESLA ACHIEVED PROFITIBILITY AND HIGHEST MARGINS. THIS. NOTHING ELSE. THIS SOFTWARE. (But don\u2019t tell anybody about this, okay? ;) )   \n   \n \n\n**6)** **Selling Insurance Products \u2013** Oh no, Warren. He once famously said when asked about Tesla insurance \u201can auto company is about as likely to succeeed in insurance business as an insurance company is likely to succeed in auto business\u201d. Little did he understand insurance of automobiles of the future. Tesla has all the data with regards to your cars. More data than any other insurance company can ever have. Tesla has 360\\* camera data, vehicle sensor logs, etc. All of this is proprietary. You can maybe gain access to GPS and front-cam via dash camera if you\u2019re a 3rd party insurance company, but you cannot compete with Tesla on the magnitude and diversity of data that Tesla has. Getting into insurance is a difficult process, but Tesla will prevail and eventually offer it everywhere. They\u2019re currently offering it in California only. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7)** **Develop RNA microfactories for vaccines \u2013** As per Elon, he doesn\u2019t expect this to be a big product from a finance stand-point but they\u2019re developing these machines to build cutting-edge vaccines. You can solve diseases like it\u2019s a software problem and who knows how much Tesla will decide to get into this market. They\u2019ve currently partnered with CureVac in Germany. Remember Bill Gates saying that Elon doesn\u2019t know anything about vaccines? Well, he\u2019s an idiot. Because Tesla is partnered with CureVac \u2013 a company BILL GATES IS INVESTED IN TO BUILD VACCINES. IT IS ELON WHO IS MAKING THE MACHINES THAT BUILDS VACCINES FOR BILL GATES. Idiot, consumed by jealousy. Next.   \n   \n \n\n**8)** **Materials engineering for alloys used for making their vehicles \u2013** Oh no\u2026Oh no. The material engineering is one of the most difficult things to do on this planet. There simply aren\u2019t people smart enough to even understand basics of it. Testament to this? THE TEAM THAT DOES MATERIALS ENGINEERING FOR SPACEX is the same team that does it for Tesla. Why? Nobody else knows how to do it. Please contact Tesla if you know how to do it. These alloys add to the advantage of safety and weight of their vehicles. Furthermore, the armor glass which will be built of Cybertruck is not something you can just buy off the self. This is the latest thing they\u2019re building. Don\u2019t tell anybody that Tesla uses its own alloys. This is a secret between you and I. ;) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**9)** **Develop next-gen capital machinery for their next-gen factories \u2013** Why do you think Tesla acquired the Grohmann Automation? They keep making these acquisitions but nobody wants to pay attention. The vehicles that are coming off the lines require machinery that doesn\u2019t exist - for manufacturing. Tesla does this in-house. An exception to this is the giant casting machines that are being purchased from Italy. On the whole, Tesla is bringing the dawn of automotive manufacturing revolution finally in 2021. The sheer re-imagining of car manufacturing is a little scary for the rest of the industry so they want to ignore this. Model Y that will be built in 2021 in Germany will be structurally different from the one in USA and China. This is because of the giant casting machines. Anyway, so the bottom line is Tesla is reimagining how manufacturing is done and this sounds simple but is a monumental thing that nobody else wants to embark on. Those companies like VW do something known as catalog engineering. This is when you buy a catalogue magazine and order the machines with pretty pictures. Then you are slave to the machines that you\u2019ve purchased for manufacturing cars. Elon has repeatedly said since 2 years, that Tesla\u2019s long term advantage is not software (it is not the #1 according to him) but rather manufacturing. How can this be? Isn\u2019t Tesla a noob? Well, people are in for a surprise. Tesla is going to out-manufacture the rest of the industry. You cannot beat this advantage. Other companies literally won\u2019t have the machines that Tsla is using to build their vehicles. How do you compete?   \n   \n \n\n**10)**  **Develop FSD Compuer Chip (their own silicon like Apple's M1) \u2013** So we\u2019re talking about industry leading inference chip that is based on an important concept of redundancy. There are two redundant CPUs in there because of which you\u2019re fine if one fails. You can run FSD software locally and very safely. This is cryptographically signed, so you cannot just reverse-engineer it and put it in your copy-cat car. No chip competes with Tesla\u2019s in terms of the wattage consumed and in terms of compute ability. FSD requires a great inference computer and while this capacity hasn\u2019t been yet full utilized as the chip is too strong and software still nascent, it will be soon. Nvidia has promised to come out with \u201cbetter chip\u201d next to next year but alas, by the end of 2021, Tesla would be coming out with the next gen FSD Inference Computer Chip. This will already beat anything that is in development right now. They win again on the in-car computer. Now you would like to think only in terms of compute advantage, but think deeply about wattage problem. The more the chip consumes the less the car has range. Tesla\u2019s range doesn\u2019t just come from the best-in-industry motors but from a lot of places. FSD computer is one great contributor to the high overall range. Other companies will be using third party stuff that will be generalized and power hungry. Ouch. They lose again. On fundamentals, let\u2019s not even talk about compute\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**11)**  **Develop Super-Computer with proprietary silicon for neural network training like Google's TPU** **- \"Tesla Dojo\"** **-** So this is something the industry hadn\u2019t even conceptualized because they were debating whether Lidar is good or bad. Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer that will be on the exaFlop level. This is not something that anybody can just venture into. Tesla is building their own silicon for this and this computer will be live next year (towards end). In order to achieve FSD you need to turn road driving into a game. You gotta make everything from collection of data to processing and training neural networks to updating cars automatic. This is not currently possible. But Tesla will make it possible with this computer. THIS IS A GOD DAMN SUPER COMPUTER LITERALLY SUPER COMPUTER that is BETTER THAN WHAT IS OUT THERE. The current TOP SUPER COMPUTER is ABOUT HALF THAT OF 1 exaFLOP. Good luck competing with this. Also, Google and AWS have been put on watch because Elon publically said that this computer is going to be offered as AWS-like service as well. Please continute debating Lidar while Elon takes over the world via this Skynet Cyberdyne System.   \n   \n \n\n**12)**  **Mine lithium \u2013** Hold your horses, it\u2019s getting a little crazy. Tesla just purchased 10,000 acres in Nevada to mine lithium using Table Salt. TABLE SALT. So well, they\u2019ve already come up with a revolutionary way to mine lithium and they will be more efficient therefore save more on cost. So they\u2019ll have this interesting advantage. Obviously, eventually, they\u2019ll move into more aspects of mining and and processing and keep on increasing their cost advantage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**13)**  **Manufacture cells, modules, batteries \u2013** Please refer to the Battery Day Presentation, they will dominate. They\u2019re going to be structurally putting the batteries in the structure of the vehicles itself. What this means is that there won\u2019t be battery boxes inside your car, but rather that battery cells will be integrated as part of the car structure. This is the transition that occurred in planes. The fuel is now part of the wings. This was earlier not the case. The dry electrode technology that Tesla is going to be using in their cells is going to get rid of the ovens that are required. This in and of itself is going to enable them to have terawatt level manufacturing since you need such a small space and your process speed is increased by many multiples. There is no way to explain cells without going technical so just know this that Tesla\u2019s cells are going to be the industry leading. They won\u2019t be able to produce them enough for a very long time so initially these will be put into their higher-end vehicles.\n\n**The rest of the points are self-explanatory.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Invest in GM, Ford, VW, etc. Short Tesla.**",

        "selftext": "For those of you haven\u2019t checked out C3.ai yet you really need to do yourself a favour and take a peak.\n\nI think it\u2019s quite easy to write this one off without much though because it\u2019s up like 150% in two days, but you\u2019d be making a mistake.\n\nI feel strongly that all the other major IPOs way over priced themselves and then still over performed, whereas $AI was priced a bit more appropriately and then over performed.\n\nFirst off, their Harvard educated CEO is a big deal and has successfully raised a unicorn in the past. Competent leadership is the first thing you should look for when assessing a risky stock, and these guys check that box.\n\nThe quick and dirty explanation of why you should be interested in $AI is that in addition to their ongoing software contracts (Shell, Caterpillar, US Airforce etc) **C3 is partnering with Adobe and Microsoft to create a CRM that is driven by AI.**\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, a CRM is any piece of software that a company uses to manage and track clients, customers, sales, communications, emails, web posts, etc etc all in one spot.\n\nWhenever you talk to a customer service rep and they are taking all your info and typing away, that person is working on a CRM.\n\nI work with CRMs in my marketing business, and the fact that I am skilled in CRMs is the primary reason I am worth hiring for most of my clients. As a digital marketing contractor, my CRM skills are more important than my contributions on social media and web dev.\n\nI am speaking from personal experience when I telling you, CRMs are a big deal. They are the back bone of e-commerce and digital workspaces.\n\nThe only major player that is soaking up CRM market share right now is Salesforce, which is currently worth a $200B.\n\nMicrosoft threw $50m into the IPO for $AI because they are in it for the long haul with these guys, and the investment was an attractive alternative other than a full takeover. You need to take note when Microsoft does things like this.\n\nWith Microsoft and Adobe in the mix, you have everything you could possibly need to make a comprehensive and user friendly CRM that is powered by AI. More importantly, those two companies have their claws in every single private and public organization in the world.\n\nConverting people to this new CRM they are making will be easy for them.\n\nAnd if you want to completely ignore the AI CRM component of this company, you can also consider that C3.ai is also comparable to Palantir and Snowflake. Those stocks are worth $50B and $100B respectively.\n\nWith C3.ai trading at $12B, this one is a no brainer.\n\nIn today\u2019s IPO mania, I see no reason this company doesn\u2019t carry a $20B market cap very soon.\n\nIn the long run, I see this company as a potential very very smart investment.\n\nDo not be discouraged by the insane growth it has already seen.\n\nPS: I am in for shares at $119.50. It\u2019s also worth noting I got into Palantir at $10 for 80% of my account back when everyone on reddit told me that was a stupid investment. I am just as confident about $AI today as I was $PLTR a few months ago.",

        "selftext": "**SALESFORCE CRUSHES EARNINGS AND ACQUIRES SLACK, NIKOLA STOCK CONTINUES TO TUMBLE AS WE FINALLY GET THE FIRST VACCINE APPROVAL IN THE UK, LET\u2019S DISCUSS THIS AND MORE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET**\n\nHey everyone! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.\n\nOver 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)\n\nThe biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)\n\nHere are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.\n\nWhile [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.\n\nThis news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.\n\nWell yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.\n\nOn the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.\n\nThe company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.\n\nSlack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.\n\nWe also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.\n\nWhile on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.\n\nBut we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.\n\nThe biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don\u2019t disappoint.\n\nI greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**Snowflake flops on earnings, while CrowdStrike and Okta spike, Will Chinese companies get delisted from the US? Let\u2019s talk about what happened yesterday in the stock market** \n\nHey everyone! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw both the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/sKKNVjr) and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/PzxfrWt) up about 0,2% with the SP closing at a new record high while the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/f909849) trailed and finished just below the previous close, down only 0,05%. We did see a spike in the [VIX](https://ibb.co/QMqhtMv) of almost 2% as this was quite a volatile day with the market dropping at the open before regaining traction in the middle of the trading day. We saw a relatively even market yesterday as 56% of companies were advancing on below average volume as most of the companies continue to trade well above the moving averages. The leading [sectors](https://ibb.co/d0740g8) yesterday were Energy and Financials with Materials and Real Estate lagging the market as [Small and Large Cap value plays](https://ibb.co/hLDgLmm) kept the market positive with companies like Boeing being up [more than 5%](https://ibb.co/b3jRN2s) for the day after good news on multiple fronts like Ryanair [probably](https://ibb.co/8xpKXxQ) acquiring new planes and the [first flights made](https://ibb.co/qmJNkPc) with the new 737 by American. \n\n[STOCK MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/BPVFx2d)\n\nHere is a complete [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TKsdbDn) from yesterday as we saw an even market as I said earlier, with Salesforce being the only big looser in big caps as the stock continued to dive after the Slack news. I think this was a great opportunity to buy the stock in a dip as I doubled my portfolio value on the company from 1,5% to 3% of my portfolio while also getting in [more](https://ibb.co/Pr47Th5) on Boeing, Apple, Netflix and a couple of other companies.\n\nWe also got the AAII investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/KxkbTbb) yesterday as the percentage of bulls has increased constantly in the last month. This is usually a very bad sign for the stock market as corrections, consolidations or even crashes occur when people tend be over-bullish. I don\u2019t think this will be the case at least for a couple of weeks, though I think we are poised for a small market correction in the near future before moving on even higher.\n\nHere is the most interesting [economic data](https://ibb.co/PD2XBsn) that will be released today as we get new jobless claims as well as services PMI and ISM. I expect the jobless claims to continue to get worse sadly for the next couple of weeks at least until the vaccine starts to get distributed with ADP November jobs [numbers](https://ibb.co/S6V64xJ) coming in yesterday shy of forecasts and at the lowest level since July, this is not great news for the jobless claims that will pop up early today. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/wQ3mK2b) \n\nGreat news came in this morning as the US is [expected](https://ibb.co/vYp0LDT) to have capability to immunize at least 100 million people by the end of February, that is great news, as specialist believe a herd immunity can be reached if there are about 60-80% of people either immunized or have already developed natural antibodies.\n\nWe also have a couple of interesting earnings [scheduled](https://ibb.co/6nJjrRY) for Today, as I expect Kroger to beat the estimates, though I didn\u2019t get any action on this, I did get some [action](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) on [Marvell](https://ibb.co/34x6mpN) as I bought the stock about a week ago. While I expected Dollar General to do alright and I think we might see some disappointment in [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/BPsz5Mj) just like I thought we would see bad reaction to great earnings with Zoom.\n\n\\[Later Edit:\n\n\\-Dollar General [reported](https://ibb.co/gJPRpXM) a beat on top &amp; bottom line but did not offer guidance and the shares of the company have pulled back in pre-market trading 1,6%\n\n\\-Kroger [beats EPS](https://ibb.co/bgsMckw) by 0,05$ but misses on revenue by $310M, shares down 4% pre-market\\] \n\nAlongside Marvell which I expect to beat the estimates of 25cents per share and also beat on revenue, I also [bought](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) Okta which released earnings yesterday and [crushed](https://ibb.co/VmvBzYV) expectations as recurring [subscription revenue](https://ibb.co/nftnckz) grew by more than 40% year over year as well as big increases in operating margins, billings and customers. This led the stock to [spike 8%](https://ibb.co/xzyy0qr) after hours as I will make a good profit on the investment and may even consider holding this position for the long term in the company.\n\nAlso, one other staple company from my [portfolio](https://ibb.co/pKbNy8M), CrowdStrike released earnings yesterday and delivered great [results](https://ibb.co/dgyfn8g) as the annual recurring [revenue](https://ibb.co/N6vhWfW) has grown more than 80% year over year while adding over 11hundred new subscriptions this quarter while also improving [gross margins](https://ibb.co/THfGJ2c) by 2%. The company also gave guidance for next quarter way over analyst expectations as that made the [stock soar 13%](https://ibb.co/ZGxbsRx)\n\nThe only big disappointment from earnings released yesterday was [SNOWFLAKE](https://ibb.co/6BhYKHC) as they have suffered the same way as Palantir in the first earnings report as analysts were expecting even bigger numbers after the huge rally the stock has had since the IPO. One Morgan Stanley analyst said that they needed to deliver around a 140% growth of revenue to make a good impact on the stock as the company\u2019s revenue only grew up 102%. If it continues to drop it might find the way to a good entry point, but for the moment I believe this price is to high for the company.\n\nWe also got news yesterday as the House [passed](https://ibb.co/w0Ly1MP) the billt hat allows Chinese companies to be delisted if they do not comply with new auditing rules, as this measure is expected to by signed fast by Trump.\n\nI think this is good news for investors in the long-run as I don\u2019t believe big companies like Alibaba will suffer from this, with BABA being audited by established PWC Hong Kong auditors, though this might be a bigger problem for smaller companies that are not able to follow the rules. I still believe Alibaba is a great company to buy at this price point as the company has [dropped](https://ibb.co/W283kbG) due to bad news developments in the last 2 months, but I think has a lot of room to go higher, even testing the previous highs of 319$ and surpassing them, especially with this holiday season having great sales numbers.\n\nThis news combined with the recent [upgrade](https://ibb.co/c2mwgPc) at Goldman was music to the ears of Tesla investors as the stock rose almost 3% after hours and erased the daily losses.\n\nOther news came as the House is expected to vote on the [MORE ACT](https://ibb.co/RgjnPgY), though this will be surely blocked in the Senate, this is still good news for the cannabis sector as states will likely legalize this way before we can a national bill.\n\nWhile Palantir dropped big yesterday after Morgan Stanley [warned](https://ibb.co/m4NsSWr) for a negative-risk reward in the stock as the stock has dropped more than 20% in the last 5 trading days, I sold out of my position on Palantir for a 40% profit recently but I may get back in if the price starts to make more sense.\n\nSo, with the latest developments, I believe investors should not forget about the FAANG stocks that have brought us back from the depths of the March lows. [FACEBOOK](https://ibb.co/gFd1S5R) still gives small business that will be back when the economy returns the best bang for the buck in advertising, especially with the great platform that Instagram has become.\n\nWhile [APPLE](https://ibb.co/j4YW4Qy) seems to be doing very well with the iPhone 12 sales and the new 5G cycle while also growing the services business very fast, that will bring them more and more steady cash flows for the company.\n\nDespite missing the latest sub numbers, [NETFLIX](https://ibb.co/LJ8fr37), is still producing a lot of great content, has the most subs and the most content available for streaming and I believe they will remain the best in business alongside with Disney+\n\nWhat can you say about [AMAZON](https://ibb.co/nrD5qnY) as they are a death star for every sector they get in\u2026 E-commerce is here to stay, and Amazon still has huge room for growth especially in Europe and Asia. \n\nWhile [GOOGLE](https://ibb.co/tz2htpn) was the laggard for most of the year, with travel &amp; entertainment returning to advertising, this will be very good for the company, as travel is the biggest advertiser usually.\n\nThis companies will remain great owns for the long run, even if they underperform now, which I don\u2019t expect, in the long-run this will remain some of the biggest winners in this new economy.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget December is usually a great month for stocks as people tend to not take profits on capital gains at the end of the year, so it is likely that people will keep the winners while also receiving a boost from the stock market Santa Claus effect.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "Hello All -   \n\n\nHoping to run something by the folks here for feedback. Salesforce is acquiring slack for a deal partially funded through stock ( $26.79 a share and .0776 shares of Salesforce). Currently WORK is priced at $42.90 and CRM at $221 - So it seems as if WORK stocks are pricing salesforce at around $207 when the deal closes (another way to say this would be that if the deal were to close today the price of WORK would be $43.90)  \n\n\nI'm trying to understand what the pros and cons are of the following two strategies:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Buy WORK Mar 2021 35.00 call @ $8.00:**  \n**a. Bull case 1** \\- **CRM @ 240**. That should mean that WORK should trade at $45.4 and this call should be worth $10.4 which would be a 30% gain  \n**b. Bull case 2 - CRM @ 250** . That should mean that WORK should trade at $46.2 and this call should be worth $11.2 which would be a 40% gain  \n**c. Bear case 1** is CRM @ 200 and work will be priced at $42.31 and the options would be worth 7.31 which would be an 8% loss  \nd**. Bear case 2** \\- Deal falls through. WORK prices craters. Options expire worthless\n2. **CRM Mar 2021 200.000 call @ $31.70:**  \n**a. Bull case 1** \\- **CRM @ 240**. This call should be worth $40 and I'd see a gain of 26% (Similar to bull case 1 with WORK call option)  \n**b. Bull case 2** \\- **CRM @ 250**. This call should be worth $50 and I'd see a gain of 57.7% (significantly lower than with to bull case w with WORK call option)  \n**c. Bear case** \\- **CRM @ 200.**  The options would be expire worthless resulting in a 100% loss\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm leaning towards option 1 i.e. buying WORK Mar 2021 calls because of the lower downside risk and am willing to accept a relatively limited upside. I am also long on CRM stock and would be happy to own at today's prices. Additionally I am assuming that the chances of the deal falling through are negligible.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* Please feel free to poke holes in my logic :). What am I missing or not thinking about?\n* Typically how long do these deals take to close? Looked up tableau aquisition and that completed in 2 months\n* How many options contracts of WORK would give me the same exposure as 1 contract of CRM? This should be easy math but I'm a little lost\n* Considering combining call options purchase with a put sale to improve returns but haven't spent the time to think through that yet - Any thoughts on this would be appreciated\n\nThanks for your feedback",

        "selftext": "From what little background I was able to gather from a HBR case study of [C3.AI](https://C3.AI),\n\n1. Siebel has a very successful track record of Oracle and Siebel Systems. Both of them have been leader of relational database systems and CRM, respectively.\n2. The initial idea of C3 started of as a tool to track corporates carbon footprint, which made quite a few conglomorates interested initially. But with no government carbon tax, there was no incentive for anyone to get this tool.\n3. During that time, Siebel has a terrible foot injury, and when he eventually recovers, he sees shit flying around C3.\n4. He pivots the enterprise in the IoT sector, since he knows that utility companies are still interested in his ideas and he is known to look in the right direction at the time of crisis. He gets that reputation from the industry elites.\n5. Pivoting to IoT, gets him further access to funds which he uses to deploy more IoT devices to create smart grids. These devices are able to work together and predict failures andpain points successfullly.\n6. With this success, he announces the name change to [c3.ai](https://c3.ai) and goes on to get government/military contracts.\n\nWith all that said, talking about the product which [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) offers:\n\n1. Its not a single product. It is similar to App store of ML apps. They are providing an ecosystem to leverage machine learning in a number of different sectors.\n2. They have customers limited to one per sector, because those customers are actually PoC for this model. And it shows that it is working.\n\nI would be happy to be proven wrong in my understanding of why this firm isn't an absolute buy. I'm not someone who dabbles in stock market, but this company has piqued my interest. And the last time that happened, was with CrowdStrike Security, which I still avidly follow.",

Zoom customers can then find and use these apps to enhance their Zoom experience.\n\nFrom the Zoom press release:\n\n&gt;\u201cZapps\\* help surface all the applications you need to be productive &amp; enable the free flow of information between teams before, during or after the meeting\u201d  \n*\\*Thankfully, after this press release, Zoom made the wise decision to change the name from Zapps to simply Zoom Apps.*\n\nMany big companies have already launched apps on the Zoom marketplace:\n\n* Slack have launched a Zoom integration that allows you to launch a Zoom meeting directly from a Slack channel.\n* Hubspot have launched an app that allows you to automatically track Zoom meeting information in your Hubspot CRM such as number of attendees and attendee names.\n\nWhile the idea of an enterprise company like Zoom launching an app store is definitely noteworthy**,** it\u2019s actually nothing new. Enterprise app stores have been around for quite a while In fact, Salesforce\u2019s App Exchange app store actually predates the Apple App Store by a year or two.\n\nWhen executed correctly, this enterprise app store strategy (often called a \u2018platform\u2019 strategy) can create tremendous business value.\n\nIn this post, I'll explain the benefits of this platform strategy and list some exciting public companies using it to their advantage.\n\n### The enterprise platform strategy\n\nBefore digging into the enterprise platform strategy, it\u2019s important to note that there are many different types of software platforms. Two of the most common types of software platforms are technology platforms and computing platforms.\n\n* Technology platform like AWS and Twilio allow developers to easily integrate with these platforms to perform a particular function. EG hosting a website on AWS.\n* Computing platform like Google Android and Apple iOS allow developers to build and sell apps/tools through the computing platform\u2019s app store. EG Candy Crush.\n\nThis post is focused on companies who employ a particular type of platform strategy; ***the enterprise platform strategy***. This strategy is in some ways a combination of a technology platform and a computing platform.\n\nThe enterprise platform strategy is when an enterprise/B2B software company provides 3rd party developers with tools to build apps and integrations which can then be used in conjunction with the platform company\u2019s products. These apps and integrations are then sold through the platform company\u2019s app store. This is very similar to the iOS app stores where a 3rd part developer might build a new mobile gaming app which users can purchase and use on their iPhone.\n\nA good example is Salesforce\u2019s AppExchange app store. There are thousands of apps and integrations that Salesforce customers can buy on AppExchange to be used in conjunction with Salesforce products. For example:\n\n* The Hellosign Salesforce app allows customers to create, send and sign contracts all without having to leave the Salesforce CRM product.\n* The Simple Survey Salesforce app allows you to create surveys to send to your customers all without having to leave Salesforce.\n* The Translate.com Salesforce app makes it easy to translate customer requests from various languages into your company\u2019s preferred language.\n\n### Benefits of the enterprise platform strategy\n\nLaunching an enterprise app store is essentially a strategy of moving from a narrow software solution to a broader (and more valuable) platform.\n\nWhen executed properly, a platform strategy can create the following big benefits for enterprise companies:\n\n* **More revenue.** The first benefit is pretty straightforward. Much in the same way that Apple takes a % cut of all revenue from apps sold on its app store, the enterprise can take a cut of all app sales on their platform.\n* **New customers and new markets.** A platform strategy provides opportunities for new customer acquisition in 2 ways:  \n\n   * First, many of the apps/integrations that launch on an enterprise platform are big businesses in their own right. Big businesses with lots of customers. When they launch an integration on the platform, it is likely that a certain % of their customers will see big value in the integration and become customers of the platform company.\n   * Secondly, many of the apps/integrations will fulfil the tail-end of \u201cmust-have\u201d customer requirements that aren\u2019t a core focus for the platform company. To use the previous Translate.com Salesforce app example, there may have been quite a few customers for whom the ability to translate tickets is a must-have requirement before using any CRM. It may have been years before Salesforce had the capacity to build internal translations functionality. But by launching a platform, they have allowed other companies to build apps which solve for these tail-end must-have requirements, thus converting more potential customers who otherwise would have used a different CRM tool.\n* **Platform companies can focus more on core competencies.** One of the biggest questions any enterprise company faces is where to put resources? For many companies, there is huge pressure from big customers to solve a myriad of tail-end must-have requirements. But platform companies don\u2019t have this problem. They can focus their efforts on their core strategy, building software that creates the most value for their full customer ecosystem.\n* **Massive customer value creation.** Similar to the above point, a successfully executed platform strategy creates an almost exponential amount of value for customers. As the platform grows with more and more apps being added the amount of value and functionality available to customers grows with it. The platform company could never build the same amount of software on their own.\n* **Stronger customer moat.** When customers buy and use apps through an enterprise app store, the platform company owns the relationship between the customer and the app. As customers adopt more and more apps, they become more heavily integrated with the platform company\u2019s products. This increase product stickiness and makes it far more difficult for customers to switch to a competitor.\n\n### What to look for in an enterprise platform company\n\nNot all enterprise platforms are created equal. In fact, in an API-first world where most products can integrate with others, it is almost a default strategy for a SaaS company once they get to a particular size.\n\nWhen analysing an enterprise platform company as a potential investment, here are some things to look out for:\n\n* **Excellent developer tools.** An enterprise platform strategy is almost entirely dependant on the quality of apps built on the platform. If customers don\u2019t use the apps, the platform is redundant. One of the most important things that a platform company can do to ensure that lots of high quality apps are built is to provide 3rd party developers with the right tools to build high-quality apps. Look for things like comprehensive documentation, visual app builders, easy to use APIs and a forum/community where 3rd party developers can collaborate and get help.  \n\n   * For an example of a high quality developer ecosystem, look at Intercom.\n* **Apps not integrations.** Many of the tools listed on an enterprise app store will be integrations between the enterprise\u2019s products and another big company\u2019s products. These integration typically allow you to send data back and forth between each tool. For example, the Intercom Salesforce app allows you to send customer data between both systems. While these integrations do provide a lot of value, a strong enterprise platform will also have lots of independent applications exclusively built for that platform. Independent applications mean that the platform ecosystem is big enough and healthy enough to sustain individual businesses being built on top of it.  \n\n   * The Zendesk and Shopify platforms are great examples of platforms with lots of independent apps.\n* **Reviews &amp; Feedback.** To understand if an enterprise platform strategy is successful, you need to understand if customers are actively using (and getting value from) the apps on the enterprise app store. One simple way to do this is to just go to the app store and look around. If there are lots of apps with customer-provided reviews and feedback, then you are likely looking at an active, robust platform ecosystem.\n\n### Enterprise platform companies\n\nBelow are some companies that are, in my opinion, executing the enterprise platform strategy very well and are therefore potential investment opportunities.\n\nWhile a well-executed platform strategy doesn\u2019t automatically make a company a good investment (it\u2019s still important to analyse these companies in their entirety) , it definitely makes the company more attractive.\n\n*(Please note, that this is not investment advice and just some companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio)*\n\n#### Zendesk ($ZEN)\n\nFrom an enterprise platform perspective, Zendesk is ticking all the right boxes. It has excellent developer tools, lots and lots of independent apps and a customer base that are heavily using the app platform (A large number of apps have over 500 reviews, which is very good for a business app in an enterprise app store).\n\nOne of the most interesting things about Zendesk\u2019s app marketplace is how useful it has been for Zendesk in acquiring new customers and moving into new markets. It has also been really helpful for Zendesk customers who had to rapidly adapt to changes this year which occurred due to the Covid pandemic. From the Zendesk Q3 shareholder letter:\n\n&gt;*\u201cIn 2020, Cabify was faced with quickly moving its Excellence Support team of more than 200 agents to remote work, requiring new methods for tracking timesheets and productivity to sustain its KPIs. Support managers leveraged integrations from the Zendesk Marketplace to help bridge this transition.\u201d*\n\n#### Salesforce ($CRM)\n\nYou can\u2019t talk about enterprise platforms without talking about Salesforce\u2019s AppExchange. AppExchange (which has over 3000 individual apps) has driven a huge amount of business and shareholder value for Salesforce. 3 things stand out in particular about Salesforce\u2019s platform play:\n\n1. **The size of the companies built on the platform.** As discussed earlier, a strong enterprise platform will have lots of apps built exclusively for that platform (not just partner integrations). Salesforce has these apps in spades. The size of the businesses that have been built just on the Salesforce Platform is staggering. FinancialForce is an ERP software provider built on top of AppExchange which has raised over $186 million in funding. Billion dollar businesses are being built on top of Salesforce!\n2. **Acquisition Opportunities.** Many of the companies that Salesforce has acquired over the years originally had apps available on AppExchange. This is a really intelligent strategy by Salesforce. Salesforce can look at the most popular AppExchange apps and acquire the ones with the most potential.\n3. **What happens to Slack?** Salesforce recently announced that it will be acquiring Slack. It will be interesting to see how this is managed from a platform perspective. Slack also has a pretty robust enterprise app store. It will be interesting to see if this is folded into the AppExchange environment or if they are kept separate. My bet is on separate but this presents an interesting challenge to the \u2018authority\u2019 of the Salesforce platform.\n\n#### Shopify ($Shop)\n\nShopify is a particularly interesting company to think about from a platform perspective since it essentially has 2 platforms. It is a platform for merchants to sell products to consumers. But it is also a platform where app developers can build and sell different applications to those merchants.\n\nThe Shopify app store is incredibly extensive with everything from fraud protection apps to search engine optimisation apps. The ecosystem is very active with lots of individual, standalone applications and many apps having over 3000 reviews.\n\n#### Zoom ($ZM)\n\nI can\u2019t open this post by talking about Zoom without mentioning it as a potential investment target. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a little early to say whether or not this strategy has been successful for Zoom. However, if successful it is a huge opportunity for the company to move from being a video conferencing solution to a broader, more valuable platform.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you found this post valuable pease let me know below. Would be happy to post more.\n\nI struggled a bit to identify a lot of software companies that have executed this strategy well. If you have any suggestions on companies that I should have included please let me know :) Would also be really interesting to hear of any companies who haven't used this strategy yet but who could be very successful if they did.

        "selftext": "So, the way I have been buying stock is I have a list of securities I wanna buy. And whenever I have $500 saved on average, I spend that on a particular stock. For example, I could spend $500 and buy 10 shares of KO at $52 or whatever it is now.\n\nNow, it would depend on the stock as well. If I wanted to buy something big ticket like Salesforce, I would prolly spend around $1000-$1500 and pickup 4-6 shares rather than only 2 at the current rate of $240 or whatever (this is just to give an example into my process of thinking)\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that I don't want to have too big a chunk of my portfolio into a particular stock. However, as my portfolio grows, I could buy shares of the same stock later on. I just don't want to put 1/3 or 1/2 my money egg in one basket.\n\nIs this reasonable? How do you do it?",

        "selftext": "Hey guys! So I'm currently working on an investing simulation on Investopedia and need help with short-term trading and day trading. Would also love advice for long-term investing for my own personal real portfolio. \n\nSo to start with my personal real portfolio, started it early this year and currently at +85.66% with about 20K invested. Portfolio currently consists of Apple, Amazon, Costco, Disney, Netflix, Nvidia, Starbucks, Square, and Twilio. Might look to invest some more, would it be recommended to buy some more shares of the same stock? \n\nFor the Investopedia simulator I only have 1-2 months left of the semester. Given an $100K budget I spent about 15K each on Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Starbucks and CRM. Now I'm looking to do some short term and day trading. Just purchased 5K into FedEx and Paypal today, so I have a decent amount around 15K left for daytrading. The problem is I have no knowledge on how to do it, how to look at what stocks might be good, when to sell based on profit/loss, etc. Any advice/resources would be greatly appreciated!",

        "selftext": "**Tesla and NIO shares are jumping after good news, while NIKOLA tumbles after GM goes for a much smaller agreement, the stock market loses ground as investors take profits, let\u2019s talk about this and much more about the stock market**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.\n\nAlmost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)\n\nEnergy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.\n\nHere are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company\u2019s future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)\n\nGreat news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it\u2019s GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.\n\nAlso, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it\u2019s shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.\n\nAlso relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.\n\nWhile the hydrogen power Nikola seen it\u2019s share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock\u2026 So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.\n\nGood news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.\n\nOther great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe\u2019s, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.\n\nWhile on the vaccine front, Moderna\u2019s candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it\u2019s head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they\u2019re first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.\n\nThe only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.\n\nMeanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn\u2019t gone to far to the left.\n\nSo I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion and other thoughts on the stock market!\n\nHave a great and see you next time!",

The subscription model continues to expand, as the company's sales and margins increase significantly and are more predictable than with one-off payments. The business models of many companies will have to adapt, especially due to the corona crisis. The subscription model will therefore continue to spread beyond the tech companies.  This is exactly where Zuora comes in, a SaaS platform to maintain and manage subscription services. \n\nIn my opinion, such a tool is particularly helpful for small and medium-sized companies in order to manage invoices, check payments and analyze sales. And by specializing in the subscription model, you can set yourself apart from the well-known ones like SAP and Salesforce. The founder and CEO of Zuora was previously Chief Strategy Officer at Salesforce, so he definitely knows his stuff. You also have well-known customers (e.g. Zoom, Dazn, Daimler, Siemens, Microsoft, Nvidia, GoPro etc.), in whose success you also participate, and you also work with consulting firms such as Accenture, Deloitte and PwC.  \n\nThe growth was a bit disappointing lately, so the price crashed a bit, but recently it has recovered somewhat and is in a clear uptrend. The price (currently $ 11.70) is still far from the all-time high of $ 37.80 shortly after the IPO 2018 and the KUV is 5 compared to other SaaS companies such as B. ServiceNow or Zendesk cheap, so I see upside potential. In September they shot up to $ 17.80 within days of the numbers, which should be the target again in the medium term. With the hype that such disruptive companies are experiencing this year, at least I wouldn't be surprised.

To me, ADBE represents the best of the \u201creopening trade\u201d without the shit fundamentals and the \u201cgrowth trade\u201d without the pre-earnings run up or IV spike. \n\n\nAdobe is the holy grail of creatives on marketing teams everywhere. I expect this avalanche of ad money to trickle down to ADBE subscriptions. \n\nThe stock is down today because they just completed an acquisition.

        "selftext": "New trader here, so just looking for some opinions before the market closes today. Anyone have any guesses on how much Salesforce will buy Slack for? I have a 40 call for 1/15. It\u2019s also a really small account so this contract is worth like 40% of my total balance lol. Leaning towards selling it before market closes today just to play it safe, but not sure. What do y\u2019all think?",

I'd love to get some tips from you guys.\n\nSo far I've invested about $1000 between VTI, CRM, DAL, GTBIF, CRON, APHA, and CRLBF. I can afford to hold onto these long term. Also I'm considering selling the delta and the cannabis stocks and instead investing in a travel etf and a cannabis etf. Does that seem like a wise idea? Maybe the travel etf can have positions in Disney and several airlines. Also I'd like to pick up another share of VTI because I only have one, but I'm not sure if it's a good time. \n\nWhat percentage of my overall wealth should be in the stock market at my age?",
