The Company has designed an end-to-end, flexible technology platform that delivers world-class performance and a low total cost of ownership to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and end customers. Proterra has three complementary businesses:\n\n* **Proterra Powered**: Delivering industry-leading battery systems and electrification solutions to commercial vehicle manufacturers;\n* **Proterra Transit:** Leading North America as the market\u2019s #1 electric transit bus OEM; and\n* **Proterra Energy:** Offering end-to-end turnkey charging and energy management solutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s industry-leading battery systems have been proven in more than 16 million service miles driven by its fleet of transit vehicles and validated through partnerships with world-class commercial vehicle OEMs, such as Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC), Thomas Built Buses, Van Hool, Bustech, and Optimal-EV. To date, Proterra has produced and delivered more than 300 megawatt-hours of battery systems, more than 550 heavy-duty electric transit buses and installed 54 megawatts of charging systems.\n\nProterra operates manufacturing facilities in California and South Carolina, as well as a state-of-the-art R&amp;D lab in Silicon Valley. The Company recently announced the opening of a new battery production line co-located in its electric transit bus manufacturing facility in Los Angeles County. This battery production line was established within a year and demonstrates Proterra\u2019s ability to bring its scalable and capital-efficient battery manufacturing process directly to commercial vehicle OEMs alongside their existing manufacturing.\" Pulled from [investors portal on Proterra's website](https://www.proterra.com/company/investors/).\n\n**Investors:**\n\nFranklin Templeton, Broadscale, 40 North, G2VP, Chamath Palihapitiya, and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC\n\n**Funds and Accounts Managed By:**\n\nBlackRock, Neuberger Berman Funds and affiliates of ArcLight.\n\nLeadership\n\n* Jack Allan, CEO, from Navistar and Valspar\n* Amy Ard, CFO, from AMG, PCC, and PWC\n* Dustin Grace, CTO, from Tesla and Honda\n* John Ensign, COO, from Tesla and Honeywell\n* JoAnn Covington, CLO, from EA and Rocket Fuel\n* Gareth Joyce, President, from Delta and Mercedes-Benz\n* Rick Huibregtse, Sr. VP Engineering, from Remy and Delphi\n* John Walsh, Sr. VP of Sales, from Rev and Davey Coach\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n* Jack Allen, Chairman from Navistar and Valspar\n* Ryan Popple, Co-Founder and Executive Director from Tesla and KPCB\n* Jake Erhard, Direct Nominee from ArcLight and Schroders\n* Jennifer Granholm, Director **Secretary of the DoE** and CNN (former Board Director)\n* Constance Skidmore, Director from PWC\n* Mike Smith, Director from Constellation\n* Brook Porter, Director from G2VP and KPCB\n* Jeannine Sargent, Director from Flex and Aerlikon\n\nI can't highlight Jennifer Granholm enough, she is the Secretary of the Department of Energy with a green Biden administration in a company that has 50% of the US Market already.

When people realize what is actually happening here and what this is about to become, I think the hype and excitement has the potential to drive these prices much higher. I see a TSLA situation brewing. No not because it's just another EV company, because it's an established, well-connected, constantly growing *commercial* EV company.\n\n**How to Play?**\n\nShares and a couple Aug and Dec calls.

        "selftext": "Posting here to offer a little perspective on what some apes saw as a quick hype play.\n\nIt was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries.

Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\".

Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) see fintel or other source for institutional ownership.

Buckle in because we\u2019re about to talk about a ...dog toy company.\n\n$CHEWY.... Ahem I mean $BARK...yeah $BARK. At first glance you might say...why? I\u2019m going to tell you why, calm down. First I\u2019m going to tell you a little bit about what this company does. This is a subscription service that will send you a new box of dog toys and treats every month. There are a couple different types of boxes/subscription services available. So, naturally,\u00a0 I'm going to exhaust myself listing them all out below.\n\n* **The original Barkbox**: This box contains different toys/treats with new ones sent each month. This would be their most pupular (heh heh) product. The subscription service offered for this product benefits those who choose longer subscriptions. Here are some prices:  \n\n   * 12 months for $23 a month ($276 a year)\n   * 6 months for $26 month ($312 a year)\n   * 1 month for $35 ($420 a year bruh)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tvfdwd0x0t871.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4141266049855a235de8cb30fc6bff70fa58c4a\n\n* **The Superchewer Box**: This box is the same idea of different toys/treats delivered monthly. The difference is that this box contains more durable toys for larger breeds or more active dogs. The prices of this product below:  \n\n   * 12 months: $30/box\n   * 6 month: $35/box\n   * 1 month: $45/box\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02jmkley0t871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65cb2aaba7124bb8a580976bd75b3f9fbcdf8bf0\n\n* **Bark Brite** \\- I dont feel like explaining this shit here\u2019s a pictographic From their website:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4q1td3301t871.png?width=2287&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73f35ab2c21063683b8a0080c00dd3a8f3572268\n\n* As you can see this box is geared towards dogs with dental problems. It\u2019s a niche market, and as an owner of a pug with literally no teeth I could tell you this market is quite open at this point in time.\n* This is priced at $30 a month on their website\n* **Bark Eats** \\- as the name implies (if you can read) this is a dog food subscription. This is a service that is personalized to your specific dogs and their diet needs.\u00a0\n* Prices for this (based on a 40 pound dog) run from $30-$60 a month. They can potentially run more depending on diet needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2bqcho11t871.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=383e9156e1389355c05705b3bf62c9e958e0486f\n\n&gt;There are a couple other cool things that chewy does. They collect information &gt;from their customer contacts about their dog breeds, ages, weight, etc (doggy &gt;demographics) in order to analyze what toys/treats/dumb shit etc work best for &gt;each type of doggo. They also have \"omni channel distribution\" which essentially &gt;just means they sell this shit on the internet, retail stores, that weird store &gt;from legend of Zelda with the onion things that shoot bubbles at you, etc. I &gt;believe that personalization as well as having multiple channels of distribution &gt;can really make bark an attractive company.\n\nAlright so now that we've gotten that out of the way, let\u2019s talk about why I think this matters. Afterwards I might even throw some numbers and charts your way. (Numbers are kind of like letters except they represent \u201camounts\u201d of something)\n\nPet ownership is a huge industry. In 2019 the global petcare industry grew to $120 billion, and spending in the US alone rose up to 50 billion dollars. In 2020 the global market has risen to 207.90 billion and 70.66 billion in the US alone. This shows a CAGR (Camping Around Gay Rabbits) rate of 5.6%. With the petcare industry growing at this rate, why wouldn\u2019t there be a need to rope people into a monthly subscription of chew toys and snacks for their 3 year old lhasa opso that only barks at black people?'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2uzsry41t871.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c93e2cf4fa4e1b6f76d04e257040c288ab98cca3\n\n**SPAC Merger**\n\nWe gotta talk about this boring shit really quick because its actually important, and the reason why we\u2019re able to talk about this stock today.\n\nOn 17 December 2020, BARK signed a definitive agreement to merge with Northern Star Acquisition Corp. (STIC), a SPAC led by Joanna Coles formerly editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan Magazine. (her head shot photo is the most intense thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed) She is also a board member in reddit meme favorite Snap (SNAP) and admittedly boring Sonos (SONO). Post merger the company began trading under $bark.\u00a0\n\nFrom Seeking Alpha\u2019s article: Barkbox: Barking up the right tree : \u201cThis merger gave $Bark $454 million of gross cash proceeds, which includes $354 million from STIC\u2019s cash held in trust and a $200 million PIPE deal led by Fidelity, Senator Investment Group, the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds, and affiliates of the Santo Domingo Group. \u201c\n\nEssentially what we are looking at here is an influx of cash to the company to expand their presence and build more business.\n\n**Company Highlights**\n\nSo, what this company does really well is their marketing and distribution. This helped them reach 1.1 million active monthly subscriptions and a super high monthly retention rate of 94.4%. They also have a huge social media presence, with 8.5 million followers.\n\nFor matter of comparison, and because I want to point out what this random fucking dog toy company is doing better than it\u2019s competitors.\n\n*Chewy has 695k followers*\n\n*Petco has 650k followers*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v1b4xt61t871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d86ca267e2aaf0c0c881c69bb31d9f6e5e251ec7\n\nBark has made some ridiculous strides over the past few years. In 2014 the company went from 80,000 subscribers to a barking 663k subscribers in 2020. Now just over the past year subscriber count has risen 58%, or from 663k subscribers to over 1M subscribers. This accelerated growth is attributed to an extreme bump in pet ownership due to covid.\n\nA recent management presentation available on chewy\u2019s website show an expectation of growth from $224M in revenue for FY2020 to $706M in revenue in 2023.\u00a0\n\n**Wait, more financials.** \n\nSo I must mention that this company is not currently turning a profit. Bark is currently focused on throwing a ton of money back into their marketing as well as r&amp;d. This is also due to the high cost related to barks current focus on third party retailers (this helps get their name out there more, but is costly). So basically this company is throwing a bunch of money into roping Becky\u2019s across the world\u00a0 into coughing up their daddy\u2019s credit card info and getting locked into a 12 month subscription of...dog toys.\n\n**A profit and loss chart from seeking alpha below:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmeteit81t871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24e1debe335145d59b106840b7642ff039e1ce5e\n\nAs we can see here, for the next few years this company expects to throw a fuckton of money into their marketing. The goal behind this is to grow the business exponentially. For 2024 and beyond, operating margins are expected to decrease. Gross profit per customer has gone up annually, while their customer acquisition costs have decreased.\n\n&gt;Simply put, this happens when a company\u2019s expenses exceed its profits. The &gt;solution? There\u2019s a few viable ones, but for BarkBox. The answer was to go &gt;public.\n\nLet's take a look at some pictures of lines\n\nWhen Bark first went public in December of 2020, the stock opened at $12.40. Over the next few days it saw a 50% rise to $19.54. Since then it has experienced a subsequent drop of around 50% again, where it is currently trading in the $10-$11 range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9eglacfb1t871.png?width=1341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebcdb22333db7e2d700ea5c65d69761ab11b5e96\n\nSo, what does this mean going forward? I don't fucking know I'm not a wizard. I did once go on the Harry Potter ride at universal studios though. So, for myself I see a good opportunity for entry at this price. Let's take a look at a similar company.\n\nChewy is another dog toy related company that just began turning a profit in the fourth quarter of 2020. They became a public company on June 14 of 2019. Also note chewy does not offer a subscription services at this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q15j9rhc1t871.png?width=1369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb87e9e2c76f017ea984aeaa4813820898d4b8f1\n\nAs we can see, this stock has essentially gone nuts over the past year. Previous to reporting a profitable quarter in march of 2020, the stock typically traded within the $20-$30 range. From the results of the company's positive 4th quarter of 2020 earnings report the stock then saw a 356% run up to a share price of $118.69.\n\n**So yea, chewy, great. Good for you. Nobody's going to argue that your stock is beast.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o738b5hd1t871.png?width=1358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=145e8778d14e69e1b42ad75a8130b3e5e3e8eb6d\n\nWhy am I using this comparison? I just want to point out how big of a **bone** the market has for a pet company (especially one beginning to turn a profit). Can bark follow in these footsteps? *It absolutely can.* It will require the company to continue sinking its teeth into new markets (which is exactly what they are doing). Personally, I remain bullish on this company. Do I expect a 355% run up this year? Well id really fucking like it if it did, but I'm OK with seeing this stock inch up to the $20-$30 range (as seen with chewy while they remained an unprofitable company).\n\nWhat do I think is going to drive this stock price up right now?\n\nOver the past month this company has received several buy ratings. On June 28, a Citigroup analyst hit the company with a buy rating. On June 10 and 14 both Jefferies and Canaccord Genuity hit this shit with a buy rating as well. So now the company is 3 for 3 on buy ratings. Pretty cool if you ask me. It can be the start of a bullish upward trend for this stock over the next few weeks/months.\n\nAs a result we've seen the stock seemingly bounce off of support in the $10 range over the past few days. While Thursday we did see a red day for the company, the stock still sit's at higher than seen earlier this month.\n\nAnyway, that's all I got. I like this stock and I feel its value in my plums. This is not financial advice, just a brief analysis on some things I like about this company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Company with great management backing them goes public, sees an initial rise in stock price followed by a subsequent fall to support where we stand today. Comparable companies show that this could be a profitable company and a worthy investment.**\n\nPositions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/suu9e3fy1t871.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f05d32c7b156cbe8ef03e27df726205741454892\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ix3ksnvj1t871.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3970f5cd87980e3fa676b6c3c6162d9b4327c348",

        "selftext": " \n\nIn response to DD posted earlier today by [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/), I saw an opportunity to steal the show for myself. (Kidding, [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) did fantastic work and you can find their post on $AMD financials rightttttttttt: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe88ub/amd_su_bae_witness_me/h45ifrd/?context=3).\n\n$AMD is easily my fav stock and I'm perpetually bullish on it, however there's a lot of catalysts that will have effects on $AMD both negative and positive at all stages. I'm not passing this on as financial advice, just my opinions:\n\n**Chip Shortage**\n\nThis one is the most significant situation in regards to semiconductors and the wider tech industry. In many cases it helps the bullish argument since $AMD (and[ also $NVDA](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/earnings) but fuckem) continues to exceed earnings estimates despite the rough environment. The[ expansion of $TSMC into America](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/), in my opinion, is going to launch $AMD into the fuckin' stratosphere over the next couple of years. Though still based in Taiwan, TSMC is one of the biggest players in global semiconductor production. As of March, $AMD was [\u201cTSMC\u2019s number one customer in regard to purchasing 7nm wafers\u201d](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html). \n\nAdditionally, let\u2019s talk about the economic giant we call China. I\u2019m an International Relations student so this is right up my ~~asshole~~ alley. While current President Biden has mentioned reversing some of the hardline policies of his predecessor President Trump, however there has been little evidence of progress towards that goal. Two weeks ago, the Biden Administration [blocked an attempt by a Chinese firm to purchase Korean chip manufacturer *Magnachip*](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/biden-semiconductors-south-korea-china-trade-war/). A small company, sure, but we can extrapolate this stance to assume that TSMC could be off limits to Chinese acquisition in the future if the US and Taiwan can come to a formal agreement. Who knows how long this US-China measuring contest will go on, but the evidence suggests to me that it would not drastically affect the prices of semiconductor companies. \n\nBeing the massive pussy that I am though, I'm concerned about how an impending crash will impact overall liquidity and the supply and demand of semiconductor chips,[ which computing technology consumes about 1/3 of](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/how-and-when-the-chip-shortage-will-end-in-4-charts). But obviously if we all lose our homes, we would have bigger fish to fry than worrying about $AMD share price. \n\n**Innovation**\n\nI'm an avid PC gamer. I literally have nothing going on other than my Steam account and my Fidelity account. This is (not) a cry for help. IMO, $NVDA has the best net technology for GPUs. However $AMD offers more consumer-friendly products. I believe that $AMD cards offer the best value per dollar paid. (Unless you're one of those idiots paying 5 grand for a graphics card. I mean c\u2019mon, you can watch Pornhub Premium without an RTX 3080.) This catalyst is just going to be driven by overall consumer sentiment. If people begin realizing that their value is better spent on $AMD graphics cards, that[ market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/754557/worldwide-gpu-shipments-market-share-by-vendor/) is gonna be gobbled the fuck up. Oh and processors? Yeah, $INTC is a piece of shit that I'm not concerned with. No source, just facts. Kidding, here\u2019s some cool charts [comparing processor performance](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-intel-cpus):\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nI won\u2019t lie, the new i9 5.1 GHz is an absolute beast, but the difference is almost negligible compared to the Ryzens, which are priced lower. \n\n**$NVDA Stock Split 20 June 2021**\n\nFuckin' $NVDA... always raining on the $AMD parade. I'm not angry, just disappointed. This stock split is actually pretty insignificant. Does this change any of the fundamentals between the two? Fuck no. Am I looking forward to it? Eh. Is there a point to me including this section? Kinda! As [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) said to me, $AMD is a bit of a \u201clate-bloomer\u201d compared to $NVDA which can be seen as the current titan of the GPU space. I expect the price of $NVDA post-split (1:4) to be somewhere between $150 and $250 just based on previous prices and my exceptional arithmetic skills. While this is still above $AMD stock price, I think it will be easier to perform comparative technical analysis between the two companies when the prices are closer. Compare that with the fundamentals I wrote about earlier and you have got one bullish ass stock.\n\n**Price Outlook**\n\nIf I was Michael Burry and had enough coke and psilocybin I would tell you guys the price target a year from now. But I'm a broke college student with no coke and only a little shrooms, so it's whatever.\n\n\\- Short term I'm playing AMD calls pretty close to the chest. Currently holding 7/9 $95c and 8/20 $100c. I roll up or down depending on how the week has gone. $AMD has been trading sideways since the run-up last June with a high of $99.23 and a solid floor around $72-$73. For a quick swing of shares I try to enter anywhere under $80 and exit above\u2026 let\u2019s call it $86.50. As of now, I\u2019m looking out for an announcement stating the date of the Q2 earnings call (I\u2019m guessing August) and I\u2019m looking for $AMD to continue its run and retest $95 before a post-earnings dip. \n\nI\u2019ve charted pivot points for our current trading range as follows: \n\n$85.57\n\n$86.10\n\nPsychological resistance at whole values between $87 and $93.\n\n$93.55\n\n$95\n\nATH of 99.23\n\n \ud83d\udcf7 \n\n\\- Mid-term? I don't fucking know, get back to me if the market crashes. If not, 6-12months out, $100-$120 with a floor around $85-$90 just based on how we've been growing and the fact that resistance-&gt;support. As mentioned I\u2019m expecting a bit of a pullback soon since tech has been absolutely soaring the last two weeks, but seeing $85-$90 turn into support is not unreasonable in the near future. Honestly I\u2019m much more uncertain about mid-term compared to short or long time frames.\n\n\\- Long term: $NVDA levels. I believe with all my heart that $AMD is the better company and should be valued as such. They are a company that continues to exceed expectations and make great connections in the computing industry. For shares I would just buy and hold until I retire. (Mod who reviewed my post in its baby stages told me that \u201cbuy and hold\u201d was a questionable term to use. I\u2019ve heard the term \u201cinvesting\u201d passed around other subreddits but hell if I know what that means.) \n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nMe and my good pal Tendo heavily believe in this company, as I\u2019m sure many others do. No price target if I\u2019m going to take a 1+ yr position. Under $80 if I\u2019m going for a swing trade that will last one month or less. \n\nSo yeah, that's about it. Great DD[ u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/). $AMD to the moon, not a financial advisor, blah-blah-blah. Who wants to see me lose half my portfolio this week? (Again.)",

        "selftext": "Ok, look. I know. I was as excited as everyone else about a shitty telecom stock with fucking Shenandoah in the title that is paying out a fucking $18.75 PER SHARE dividend. \n\nThen I did the math. \u201cOh look, I can buy 100 shares for $55. Then I can buy a $55 put for $300. I\u2019ll get the $18.75/ share dividend ($1875), exercise the put contract and stick that theta cuck that sold me this contract with 100 shares and make him eat the loss. Easiest $1575 I\u2019ve ever made. \n\nHell, why am I only doing one of these? Let\u2019s LEVER TF UP, it\u2019s only a $1k buying power hit for each one! I\u2019ve found the fucking money printer bitches!!!!!!\n\nWrong. \n\nThe issue with the special dividend is that not only is the share price going to be adjusted down by the amount of the dividend, your put contract strike price will be adjusted down as well. By the amount of the dividend. So that 55 strike put you bought is now a $36.25 strike. \n\nIt\u2019s (probably) not going to vaporize your account the way that a bunch of short box spreads can (praise be to 1ronyman, patron saint of free money), but it\u2019s not going to be the massive winner you think. \n\n[fidelity article on special dividend adjustments](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/contract-adjustments)",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, since I have come on Reddit late January I have been asked this many times, almost daily. I have told people eventually when I have more time I will write a post on it. There was no debate this is probably the most asked question that I have\u2026.Well why do you day trade? Well 50 cents isn\u2019t good enough for me? You trade for 5 to 10 cents? That makes no sense.\n\n**I was going to write this post it was just when, not if. Please remember I am not a journalist, I am not compensated to write these, so when I spend hours writing a post and pour insight from a real trader that is on the battlefield everyday since 1995 it does mean much more then an author or even most money managers. I am on the war path watching the movement all day. Now, if I ever publish a book in my mid 50s this will probably go into it, because this isn\u2019t even full details but will at least get the message across and ideas of what Long, Swing, Day Trade. The first few paragraphs were what forced me to trade sooner, and how I started you can skip that if you want.**\n\nI am going to go back to how I started in 1995 and It matters because it is why, I started as a swing trader that held positions from 1-6 months or even a year\u2026 It slowly evolved and I pretty much try to liquidate my account to have other opportunities the next trading day.\n\nI am not exactly sure if I started in 1994 or 1995, it was probably the end of 1994. I was 14 or 15, I was always crazy about cars, and could not wait to buy a used car, even if it was a beat up Oldsmobile. My Uncle lived in Long Island in a very fancy estate and did not work at all. He was in his late 30\u2019s and always spent time with my brother and I. I remember saying Uncle Andrew, you do so well, when I am 16 or 17 if I can save up to buy a car that would be a dream. He told me he would give me something even more valuable then money to buy the car. Naturally, I was piqued, I knew nothing about the stock market but here I am with $2,000 and my Uncle tells me there are ways I can definitely by the time I am 17, not only have a car but not some cheap Oldsmobile. He put me in touch with a broker he knew from JB Oxford. He told me to read the Wall Street Journal everyday and would quiz me on articles. I opened an account with JB with the $2,000 and at that time trades were $50, they did allow the first 5 trades free because of his relationship with my uncle. I started to read and my uncle told me his preference for long term, and his strategy. My first investments were things he and I both agreed upon. Coke KO, Disney DIS, Philip Morris MO, American Power APC which got bought by Cisco eventually. So I put $500 in each of these 4 and let them grow. I would watch everyday in the journal and find the tickers, AOL didn\u2019t get big until 1996. It was his guidance that caused me to hold them long. Eventually after close to a year the account was almost doubled at near $4,000.\n\nNow by the time I was 16, AOL was booming and I got internet access right away. My uncle was old school and read the paper everyday. Eventually I could get quotes immediately online, and get information much quicker. I started to realize that if I time these things and could get quotes throughout the day I could make that money faster and even more. I was going off of end of day quotes. And I would call Anthony my broker from JB Oxford the next day and place a limit order\u2026.once a year. As I called him more and more because I was getting mid day quotes, he took to a liking of me. He invited me to the city and to meet with other brokers. I started to see the platforms, the super computers, I met market makers, important people. Some of which invited me daily. I started to write important stuff, keep a journal on AOL. By the time, I was 17 I was a swing trader, I could name the Dow 30, and pretty much the entire SP500. I could tell you roughly the closing prices on them all. (I cant even do that now). I was labeled the chosen one\u2026\u201dUltimate\u201d by market makers\u2026. In 1997/1998 JB was about to be bought out eventually I believe it happened in 2000, but I say that because I opened an Etrade account, in case, as Anthony warned me. Etrade was charging $29.95 per trade and could be done online. **ONLINE TRADES?? AND JUST $30!!!** Yea you cant imagine how funny that sounds now. The purpose of this paragraph is that when online trading came and just at $30 per trade. I moved from most of my positions being held for 1-3 months to 1 month. Remember I started at like 6 months to a year, to trading and hanging out with brokers and holding 1-3 months to just 1 month. With the evolution of information and discounted trading I traded more and more. I don\u2019t know exactly the year, but I called TD Ameritrade which started to grow at the time. Etrade came down to $19.95 per trade. Ameritrade told me if I could do at least 30 trades a month they will discount me to $14.95\u2026\u2026Boom, JB was bought out\u2026I now had an account with etrade and ameritrade. I was enticed to trade more actively with discounted trades. Eventually I called etrade and told them I would like to close the account my $14.95 per trade at Ameritrade was awesome. Etrade fought for more hard. They said if I made 150 trades a quarter they would retro back to the trades in the quarter and make it $9.95 per trade. Ameritrade said If I could do 150 trades they would match the $9.95 per trade and give me 10 free trades! It was a crazy back and forth the whole time I didn\u2019t close either account and I was forced to make crazy trades for these discounts. I was forced to be a day trader, but I started to get a great skill set. At 1 point etrade almost demanded I close the Ameritrade and said they were creating a new division called Platinum/Power Etrade and if I keep my 150 trades a quarter they are paying for DSL (High Speed Internet) WOW! You are all so spoiled, you have no idea how bad 56K dial up is. And around the year 2001/2002 when I had DSL (which is now extinct) It was like 300MB download so 6x 56K phone dial up, but no one had it. No one, if you had DSL it had to be like some big bank or someone really important. It was like $400 a month remember this was 2001/2002. So I was pretty much forced to be day trading but I developed a good skill set. They both told me trading less I would lose the discounts\u2026..Etrade said I would pay a discounted rate of $200 per month for DSL if I didn\u2019t make enough trades.\n\nBy around 2005/2006 I am not sure how, but other brokers started to catch wind of me being an active day trader. Still don\u2019t know how but at that time there wasn\u2019t nearly as many traders, trades. Fidelity called me and didn\u2019t want to take no for an answer. They offered me $7 per trade if I could make 100 trades a quarter. So here I was with 3 different accounts (Opened for commission discounts, freebies), because commissions could eat into cost. So I had the 3 accounts Etrade, Ameritrade, Fidelity.\n\nAround this time, I was about 25 and decided to open an IRA with Chase, because I had no 401K of course. So that is how I have the Chase account. I started IRA\u2019s at 25.\n\nThe above paragraphs are to describe the evolution and I guess forced hand at being a day trader in order to receive discounts. I kid you not that there were probably quarters where I did 1,000 trades. They all worked by quarters, not months. Eventually I got a cable modem, and trading was discounted and I was not required to trade as much.\n\n**Now this is for more, because I have so many years experience. This may not work for you, or your comfort level. I compiled watch lists of over 800 tickers, I have studied their patterns, read their finances. I say this because it may be easy for me to take a stock and trade it for 10, 50 or 75 cents.**\n\nThere is always a trade for me, if I want it. I have lists which I said you should make in my posts about daily routine. So that I don\u2019t have to search for symbols. I simply click a situation and I have the symbols right there and I can trade. Defensive, Power Plays (High Pe, NO PE, Hyper Growth), Dividends, Finance, Insurance, Dow, Top SP, you get the picture. Why this is important is I don\u2019t have to scour and search everywhere for a play or news. I can click a list and see anything abnormal so there is always a trade for me, if I want it.\n\n**Some bloody days, it is better to sit on the sidelines and do nothing. On a typical day I may do 2-4 rounds (BUY/SELL) On a bad day I do 0 of course**\n\n**I do not set stop losses. My stocks have fundamentals, if you trade garbage you get garbage and you may lose. I keep NIO, LMND, SNOW on lists so I can laugh.**\n\n**I haven\u2019t shorted since 2014 (TSLA), I haven\u2019t bought options since 2017 (Puts on TSLA). I learned the had way shorting you cant go against a cult stock or freight train. Options I learned it\u2019s a gamble you win or go home. Though I was very successful earlier, but I lost 50k on the short and 25K on TSLA puts. We must learn from our mistakes.**\n\nNow a couple of reasons why day trading is better\n\nYou keep cash ready for an opportunity the next day. Yesterdays crazy drop, and rally. Unfortunately, my portfolio was about 66% stocks, and 33% LL which I don\u2019t like to do so I have opportunity. I generally like to have at least 50-66% of cash ready. Unfortunately, I do not take losses, and my day trades turn into swing trades. Generally they never last more then 5 to 10 business days. My longest recently was 7-8 on Allstate which I sold at 106\u2026. Now it is 112 on a defensive market.\n\nThose 25-50 cents add up quickly. I made an example in 1 of my posts usig RKT. I started trading RKT about 19-20. The market hates RKT and even after awesome earnings it comes down. Also, now everything is commission free!!! I literally have gotten about $20 on RKT, that is how much I have scooped with that 25 to as much as a dollar. **There are plenty of very successful day traders that pick 5 to 10 stocks and trade them for a living!** As a kid, I saw market makers that would focus on 2-3 all day the same ones for a month.\n\nOn VRM I probably made about the same with 50 cents to 2 dollars. Knowing and studying the patterns is critical if you want to be a day trader. Before VRM took off. I carefully studied the pattern from 33-38 over a 60 day period and once it blasted thru 38 I did not trade it until this past Thursday. Yes, of course stocks can blow by comfortable trading levels and we must pivot and do something else\\*\\*. HELLO 800 TICKERS!\\*\\*\n\nIf you do not plan on viewing stocks daily, or weekly I actually recommend Index funds like the RUSSELL 2000, the SP500, the Nasdaq 100\u2026.. Do not buy mutual funds (heavy fees) and I do not recommend ETF\u2019s way riskier and higher fees than index funds. Look at the superstar Cathie that\u2019s now down over 20%. I look at her portfolio and laugh. So no ETFS! Do not be a stock picker if you don\u2019t plan to reevaluate at least every quarter on an earnings report. Things can change on a dime. Did you see VRM!!!!\n\n**Yes there are Apples, Netflix, Amazon, Invisalign (All which I did own), but remember there are close to 10,000 stocks that trade so what is the probability you own the next best thing since sliced bread?**\n\n**Trading a lot is about probability, risk on the upside, the downside. Market sentiment, as we see interest rates etc. You must monitor or I suggest the index funds.**\n\n**If you plan to be a great trader it takes a ton of patience, reading, experience and seeing the market. Do not believe you can quit your job and be a day trader for life unless you are willing to do that? Did you read my daily routine? I follow that to this day!! Will you? If you do not or 1 day decide to wake up late you can see red crayons for a while. The other day a reddit user whom I like and he messages me daily went on the hype train with RKT, though it was against my advice. He had a chance to get out and be slightly profitable the next morning. Instead he partied and drank the night before and now RKT is 24\u2026\u2026\u2026.Do you know what a mistake that was?

I am saying this because to be successful this is not a game, it may seem like it until red crayons and you need the money.**\n\n**Lastly, do not believe I will continue to do this with no compensation forever. Do not think you all can sleep wake up, get great plays, make money and the next day just rinse and repeat. I will stay on Reddit and will not close the forum/group. My posts will remain as great insights from a trader. I do not know what I plan to do yet. My 60 day experiment will end March 31st. What I can say, is that I will absolutely not spend 2-3 hours a day on reddit with no compensation. I am happy if everyone around me learns and makes money. But I also want to land that 500K job, yup it\u2019s a long shot but I was giving the experiment 60 days. And yes, Wall Street Journal did reach out to me\u2026..but once I said I wanted 500k\u2026 everyone got quiet. Listen, I have to make more than Im making now. I have to be able to retire from my W2, maybe stop doing computers for this to be worthwhile.**\n\n**So 3 hours later, yup took me 3 hours to write this, I hope it helps.

        "selftext": " My life story that no one asked for (you can skip this part): \n\nWhat's up r/SPACs, I spend the last 3 month thinking about IonQ as the first thing in the morning and last thing in the night. I always wanted to invest in a quantum computing company, but the public market didn't provide me with any opportunity that seemed worth it. Then IonQ came along. Initially I was a bit sceptical because I never heard of them before, but I was intrigued nevertheless. The more I got into the stock, the more I wanted to find out. This DD is the result.     \nYou might have noticed my username, therefore caution is advised. I'm pretty much hit or miss with my trades, which brought my account from 8K to 1.3M, back down to 10K back up to 130K. As you might have guessed, I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise. Do your own DD. I religiously tried to source everything I write here, therefore you can take your own trip down into the rabbit hole. Some things I write are speculation and I hope this is clear from the context. I'm not an expert in quantum physics, nor a computer scientist (even though I studied it for half a year). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n LIFE STORY OVER, LETS GET TO IT \n\n The only thing which is key to understand quantum computing in my DD is seen in this picture: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(1\\)](https://preview.redd.it/46wo0wvm77971.png?width=1273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c11dfb115cbc995886a312f2454b5727c14e2db)\n\nThis is how you can envision a quantum circuit. What matters here and what is the number one thing quantum computing is trying to achieve, is getting a program through the circuit. The problem with QC is that those \u201cqubits\u201d (which comes from bits), have errors when doing computation on them. Therefore if you give them 5 things to do (5 gates), they might end up somewhere you didn't intend them to end up at. With every step they make, the error gets bigger. Getting this faultiness out of them is the end goal of quantum computing. Unfortunately, this is really hard.   \n\nNow let's look closer at what a quantum computing circuit consists off: We have qubit number, 1 gate fidelity, 2 gate fidelity and connectivity. We have the number of qubits on the left. You can perform gates on those qubits. Those usually involve 1 or 2 qubits. If you want to know how \u201cprecise\u201d a operation on 1 qubit is, you check the single gate fidelity. If you want to know how precise a operation on 2 qubits is, you check 2 gate fidelity (they move together due to entanglement). The higher the fidelity, the more operations you can do on a qubit until the result becomes too faulty. What isn't visible in the picture is connectivity between qubits. If you have all to all connectivity, you can perform 2 qubit gates with no additional steps. If you don't have all to all connectivity, you need to \u201cmove\u201d the  information of the qubits in order for them to be next to each other, which requires additional gates.     \n    \nQuantum Volume: I will talk about quantum volume in the DD a lot, therefore a short explanation of this benchmark is necessary. For some time, the number one thing a quantum computing company touted as a success was the number of qubits. The number of qubits alone doesn't really matter for a quantum algorithm, since they are faulty. This brings us back to the quantum circuit picture. What quantum volume tells you is, how many 2 qubit gate operations you can make until its becomes too noisy. For example, you have 8 qubits that you randomly perform 2 qubit gates on. If you can do this 4 times in a circuit, you have a circuit depth of 4. Each depth means that you randomly paired up the qubits and made a 2 qubit gate. 8 times and you have 8 depth and so on (2).   In order to not let depth or qubit number become dominant, the smaller of those two is counted. E.g. if you have 10 qubits and a depth of 8, you pretend that you only have 8 qubits and vice versa. (3) If you get an 8 for example, the quantum volume is 2\\^8= 256. If you get a 12 the quantum volume is 2\\^12 = 4069 This number you put after the \u201c\\^ \u201c is what IonQ calls \u201calgorithmic qubit\u201d. You get the number by taking the log2(quantum volume) (4). In our example this would be an 8 for 2\\^8 and a 12 for 2\\^12. The number in quantum volume that IonQ will reach in the future becomes too big, therefore they made this adjustment.   \n    \n    \n(1) https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5160469/Quantum-Computation-Primer-Part-2 \n\n(2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD-JCi0lcLo \n\n(3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\\_volume \n\n(4) https://www.zdnet.com/article/ionq-introduces-algorithmic-qubits-to-counter-quantum-volume-in-quantum-computing/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1) IonQ is 5 years ahead of the competition, in a race that will take 10 years**. \n\nThe Quantum Volume benchmark is the industry standard and was developed by IBM. IonQ is the leader: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(1\\)](https://preview.redd.it/zb1d3fgo87971.png?width=1511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54616ec9550c90ac3ff1bd92a7eec747a22c3572)\n\nIonQ issued a press release claiming a quantum volume above 4 million. As of right now, they didn't publish those results in a scientific paper, which earned them some criticism. The reasons for not publishing those results in a scientific paper are twofold. For once, they are waiting for the merger to get closer. Once they publish those results, they should see a good amount of press coverage. The second reason why they don't rush to publish the results is that they want to get their quantum computer to a point where it can reliably hit this benchmark. It is one thing to fine tune your quantum computer to get a benchmark and another thing to have this benchmark be met reliably.     \nWhat IonQ did already publish was a paper that used the new quantum computer. The numbers in that paper make it clear that IonQ can hit the benchmark, so there is nothing to worry here.   \nTo claim leadership based on this benchmark is done  by Honeywell right now: \u201cThrough performance upgrades, System Model H1 achieved a quantum volume of 512, the highest measured on a commercial quantum computer to date.\u201d -Honeywell (3) Once IonQ's quantum computer is measured, the word \u201cmeasured\u201d goes away. Once it is reliable, the word \u201c commercial quantum computer\u201d goes away.     \n    \n  \n\nHere is how the next 5 years will most likely look like: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33da3ijz87971.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8568b8ac9c78cd5719586c0cad91700169df56c8\n\nIn this graph I'm not using quantum volume, I use algorithmic qubits. If I would use quantum volume, IonQ would be of the charts. They express the same thing, just in smaller numbers.   \nI use IBM's roadmap to get an implied roadmap for Google. IBM and Google use the same architecture and are at a similar level right now, so I think this is fair.  Honeywell already published their roadmap using quantum volume. Those not included, didn't publish a roadmap yet that is applicable within the next 5 years. Quantum Volume gives you a good idea of how well one can perform error correction (How small the overhead will be). Unfortunately, it is hard to make a performance roadmap right now, once you include error correction. I will talk about the other player in the markets in a latter paragraph.     \nWhat is important to note is that, without error correction, the other players can't catch up to IonQ, even if they push their physical limit. I think it is no coincidence that IonQ hit this specific mark. They just wanted to make sure that they remain number one and are able to focus on the other parts of the puzzle. \n\nWhat this graph shows is that due to the limit in gate fidelities, even with an increase in qubits, there is a limit to the QV one can achieve without error correction. IonQ just happens to hit the limit of superconducting qubits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(1\\)](https://preview.redd.it/bk9oz91d97971.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5204a5ca389ce0162df010ed7341785b0f9ee9e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is no coincidence that IonQ is in the lead right now, since they used to be in the lead, when their 4th generation QC was introduced ,2 years ago.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source \\(7\\) min 10:38](https://preview.redd.it/wiw912mk97971.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf328daf959702a91bb78b759595a7816173ac2b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(1) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521114527/d138876d425.htm \n\n(2) https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11482 \n\n(3) https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/news/2021/03/honeywell-sets-new-record-for-quantum-computing-performance  \n\n(4) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521114527/d138876d425.htm  \n\n(5) https://www.hpcwire.com/2020/04/07/honeywells-big-bet-on-trapped-ion-quantum-computing/  \n\n(6) https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2020/01/quantum-volume-32/ (7) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Lg1nSd6Y \n\n**2)** **IonQ is the only quantum startup backed by the who is who in tech.**   \nIn this part, there are four things I want to stress.   \n\n\\-One thing is that IonQ has a unheard of backing from tech companies. We all know the headlines \u201cX company backed by Y goes public\u201d. That will be a long list for IonQ.  \n\n \\-The second thing is that this is not normal for quantum computing companies. The IonQ investors didn't diversify into many companies. They all went for IonQ.  \n\n\\-The third thing is that those tech investors are capable of running the business numbers that I will later lay out. I don't have the precise numbers, but they do. I assume they did the same thing that I did and came to a similar conclusion.   \n\n\\-The last thing is that some people claim that the former \u201cstealth company\u201d PsiQuantum has some tricks up their sleeves. Yet the investor base does not drastically indicate this, even though they should have non public informations. I think in the case of Rigetti, the lack of industry support can be seen as foreshadowing for what happened to them. I only use company investors and founders, since they have the technical expertise. I think Wall Street money isn't really expressing much.   \nThose are the company investors: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source \\(1\\) \\(2\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1radnmwga7971.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2d20e282455b4f5d145997a9d5e2aaa0cf76694)\n\n Those are the \"founder of company\" investors: There are 2 ideas for the 65$ provision. Either this is based on expectations for hype. The other is the expectation of a bidding war. The bidding war thesis builds on the fact that there are no founder shares, the possible buyers already have a postion and have them on their cloud plus the buyers can't buy right now because they would have to file with the SEC, which would indicate that they are accumlating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source \\(1\\) \\(2\\)](https://preview.redd.it/s2307etja7971.png?width=986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8e10c93ed848f53b848e2d6e6067c2a31423ee0)\n\nHere is PsiQuantum:   \n\nThey moved into Silicon Valley to get better access to funding (3).\n\nHere is the story about Microsoft's quantum paper getting retracted from Nature for having \"unnecessarily corrected\" some of the data, making it part of the 79 papers in the history of Nature that got retracted (4). \n\nMicrosoft is also diversifying their effort pretty heavily (5). \n\nThem having the Founders Fund as an investor is pretty noteworthy nevertheless.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(6\\)](https://preview.redd.it/34k7cg1nc7971.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d594ffcaae0c456420bbb950874384232e9e12f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Rigetti: They suffered a massive down round in their latest funding round (7) and had an exodus of employees (8). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(9\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2usbmirqc7971.png?width=981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=623a28df1f6949950d2c1110444a25a327b97db3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(1) https://ionq.com/company\n\n(2) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521098621/d70340ds4.htm\n\n(3) https://www.ft.com/content/a5af3039-abbf-4b25-92e2-c40e5957c8cd\n\n(4) https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56328980\n\n(5) https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/quantum-computing/network/#customers\n\n(6) https://psiquantum.com/\n\n(7) https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/rigetti-computing-took-a-71-million-down-round-because-quantum-computing-is-hard/\n\n(8) https://www.wsj.com/articles/quantum-computing-remains-a-challenge-for-tech-firms-11578345473\n\n(9) https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/65891-35#signals\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **IonQ got three dollar in government money for every dollar spend in private money****.**   \n\nUp until now, IonQ received more then 160 million dollar from government funds, while receiving \\~80 million from private investors. This made it possible that they created 5 generations of Ion-Trap quantum computers while only spending 50 million dollars, leaving 30 million on the balance sheet. (1) And those are just the research grants. Now throw in the unpaid work of PhD students, the facilities provided by the universities, the wages paid for the professors, the research done at other universities and we are getting a good bang for our bug. (2)   \nSome claim that China might have an advantage, since they are investing heavily into quantum computing,but the existing funding is likely to increase. China spends about $2.5 billion on quantum research annually, more than 10 times what the U.S. Spends (3). President Biden said in his first press conference that the USA will increase spending in future technology's from 0.7% of GDP closer to 2% of GDP and explicitly mentioned quantum computing (4).     \nIonQ will have great access to this additional funding, since they are the only entity that got 2 seats on the New National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee (NQIAC) (5).     \nAdditionally, the ex-CEO lead multiple quantum initiatives in Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) before coming to IonQ. (6) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: \\(7\\)](https://preview.redd.it/6g6hwvlmg7971.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c34639967cfa7b540c90e11a9f08e47571174c69)\n\nA nice thing about IonQ is that they are extremely transparent about their progress, instead of choosing the stealth way.     \nIonQ is the number one quantum company to publish articles in the journal *Nature.* Up until now, they published 8 Nature articles and 3 Nature Communications articles. They have a total of 19 journal articles. (8) Besides being prestiges, those articles lead to additional government funding. (9) \n\nTo get some comparison:   \nHoneywell got 1 Nature article and a total of 4 journal articles. (10)                                                                IBM has 1 Science*,* 1 Nature Communications and a total of 3 journal articles. (11)   \nAlpine Quantum Technologies has 1 journal article. (12) \n\nKeep in mind that most big tech companies hire university teams to push their quantum effort. The only company that kinda build their own effort that I know off are Honeywell and IBM. They most likely recruited out of universities as well, but they don't seem to haven taken a whole team. Google hired John Martinis and his team at the University of California Santa Barbara for example. (13) We have a saying in Germany which goes like: \u201cThey only cook with water as well.\u201d This basically means they can't use magic to be better then someone else.   \n \n\nTo conclude this part, IonQ is expected to receive a bigger share of a growing pod of funding while simultaneously being the most achieving quantum research group there is. This research can pay stockholder handsomely.     \n\n\n(1) https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2021/05/28/ionqs-virtual-financial-analyst-day\u2014an-inside-look-part-one/ \n\n(2) https://ionq.com/news/october-29-2020-ionq-unveils-new-quantum-data-center \n\n(3) https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-quantum-computing-threat-to-american-security-11573411715 \n\n(4) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oYjSwJSomc .Min 45:47 \n\n(5) https://www.energy.gov/articles/white-house-office-science-and-technology-policy-and-us-department-energy-announces (6) http://trajectorymagazine.com/quantum-leaps/   \n\n(7) Koller.

Either because they invented the stuff or massively contributed to the development. If you take a look at the employees at IonQ you see some who are directly hired and some who serve as advisors. The reason that a lot of them serve as advisors is their involvement with the universities. They are part of the IonQ effort nevertheless.   \nI started mapping the people to the roadmap:     \nYou can divide the path to a complete QC in 3 parts: Architecture, Error-Correction, Scaling. The first part is the basic architecture.

On the university side, Duke and Maryland are at the centre. They are putting in a big effort to juice up their quantum effort with talent and funding. Some way or the other, they will contribute to the IonQ mission, since IonQ is at the forefront of quantum computing.    \n    \n     \n (1) https://www.nist.gov/nist-and-nobel/dave-wineland/nobel-moments-dave-wineland  \n\n(2) https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/chris-monroe-profile#.Xz4HSjv3RS0.twitter  \n\n(3) https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/12/scientists-are-close-building-quantum-computer-can-beat-conventional-one  \n\n(4) https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/26/916744/quantum-computer-race-ibm-google/  \n\n(5) https://scholars.duke.edu/person/robert.calderbank  \n\n(6) https://www.nature.com/articles/npjqi201634  \n\n(7) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umesh\\_Vazirani  \n\n(8)  https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/news/2020/10/get-to-know-honeywell-s-latest-quantum-computer-system-model-h1  \n\n(9) https://www.jstor.org/stable/26046953 \n\n(10) https://www.nanalyze.com/2021/03/ionq-quantum-computing-stock/  \n\n(11) https://www.f6s.com/jungsangkim  \n\n(12) https://blog.executivebiz.com/2020/06/quantum-computer-maker-ionq-raises-additional-funds-adds-four-members-to-advisory-board/  \n\n(13) https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/3940 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **5) The TAM of quantum computing is estimated at 65 Billion by 2030 and the gross profit margins of 90% are only rivalled by Software**   \n\n\nConcerning the TAM:   There are two main areas of uses for quantum computers. One is simulating nature, the other is running algorithms.   In nature, many processes are depended on quantum physics. Quantum physics is really hard to simulate on a normal computer. Faced with this problem, the initial idea behind quantum computers was to simulate quantum physics (1).   It is pretty uncontroversial that quantum computers will create value here. Therefore the expected TAM coming for this is predictable, especially since modern supercomputers are already used for that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Stolen from Kenneth Brown's twitter account, who took it from the Department of Energy ASCR programs especially INCITE. ](https://preview.redd.it/yu8s49chj7971.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0e47a5ad642cbade00e85db2b2f33db20d2b3fe)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other area is doing complicated math.

How useful quantum computing is in those areas is still being researched, but early results are promising.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Boston Consulting Group YouTube Q2B](https://preview.redd.it/45j0z5qlj7971.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c4f2108c9f5c8a8331a2ab37c2322d7803b5fd2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n What is noteworthy in this regard is that we starting to see a slow down in Moore's Law. Therefore the reduction of costs for computation is slowly starting to decrease less, while the need for computational power is steadily increasing. Therefore the chip industry will start to see problems when it comes to meeting the ever increasing demand (2).   \n\n\nBy 2023, 20% of organizations intend to budget for quantum-computing projects, compared to less than 1% in 2018 (3).     \n\n\nConcerning the sales strategy, IonQ is the only company that is available on all 3 major cloud providers. Once QC are sufficiently strong to be commercially interesting, the customers will come based on a cost/benefit calculation. Therefore what matters most here is creating the access.    \n    \n    \n*Concerning the gross profit margins:* \n\nLet's talk about how quantum computers create value for shareholders. There are certain problems where normal computer needs exponentially more resources to solve a problem as the problem increases. Quantum computers don't. Mentally you can picture it like this: If faced by a applicable problem, you need to double the computing power every time the problem gets harder, while you only need one more qubit with a quantum computer. This can make quantum computing extremely profitable.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38068uyxj7971.png?width=1914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81ed98718227fe645b982e6df24afef4308f26ca\n\n Each additional n in this scenario, would double the cost in supercomputer time!

The market has a high cost of entry, a high level of specialised knowledge and a very long time from research to having a prototype to eventually having a working quantum computer. Therefore the market in and off itself looks like it will only be ruled by a few players.   \n\nMore specifics: Those are my  bear case bullet points concerning the specific companies and not the technology they are employing.   \n\nHoneywell: Honeywell initially tried to sell a subscription service for their Ion Trap Quantum Computer. They promised the subscribers access to increasingly strong QC (1). Since IonQ made a massive leap, those subscribers have no reason to stay subscribed. Therefore the funding dried out and Honeywell is selling part of their Quantum Business to cut losses. No one gives away their golden goose. They are not even planning on catching up to where IonQ is now in the next 5 years. \n\nRigetti: Rigetti had a massive valuation cut in their last round (2). They also had a mass exodus of employees (3). They do the same thing that IBM does, but perform worse.   \n\nPsiQuantum: Not much information available to the public, due to their history of being \u201cstealth\u201d. Based on their investor base, what they say in private isn't mindblowing. Microsoft is among the worst to get as an investor in this space to get credibility. Again the Founder Fund is really what keeps them on the map, appart from their claims concerning the future.\n\nGoogle: Googles lead Software went to IonQ, while their Lead Hardware went to another company as well (4). I don't think this is a huge indicator, but it's not great either. Both of them didn't see a future in the Google quantum effort.   \n\nIBM: I have nothing \u201cbad\u201d to say about IBM. Their business strategy seems to be working, but they are giving a good chunk of QC time away for free (5). It is no surprise that they have a huge developer base. Once the QC become commercially interesting, the customers will come to the person supplying the best QC.    \n\n(1) https://www.zdnet.com/article/honeywell-introduces-quantum-computing-as-a-service-with-subscription-offering/ \n\n(2) https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/rigetti-computing-took-a-71-million-down-round-because-quantum-computing-is-hard/  \n\n(3) https://www.wsj.com/articles/quantum-computing-remains-a-challenge-for-tech-firms-11578345473 \n\n(4) https://www.wired.com/story/googles-head-quantum-computing-hardware-resigns/ \n\n(5) https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/quantum-computing-at-ibm/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7) Ion Traps have a cost advantage against other types of quantum computers.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/im04sahov7971.png?width=1466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d5adecb79dc5b94fcce8fe585ba4c6c0a676ac8\n\nI will go a bit into detail for Superconducting Qubits and Photonic Qubits. I group the rest. \n\nThe main case against superconducting qubits is the cost to keep them at a temperature close to the absolute minimum (-270 celsius or 0 kelvins). The fridge itself costs about 300.000 thousand dollar for the systems used to day, which doesn't include the electricity costs of running them (1).  The other factor is that everything that goes on in the fridge needs to be able to work at those temperatures, which is no easy task. Additionally they have a naturally higher error rate, which creates an bigger overhead. Therefore they need more physical qubits to build a error corrected qubit (2).   \n\n\nPhotonic qubits are also sometimes mentioned. The biggest problem for them is the extremely high overhead. They claim that they will use about 10.000 physical qubit to build a error corrected qubit (3). Additionaly they need some refrigiation aswell, but it's not extremly cold. \n\nAnother factor which is important here, is that IonQ's chips aren't \u201cquantum\u201d in a sense. The only thing quantum about them are the Ions (4). The rest of the chip uses technology that is already being produced, therefore if you compare the cost of a single qubit, IonQ won't be that expensive, while IonQ's physical qubits can do a magnitude more of work.   \n\n\nFor both competing systems, if you look at the performance to costs metric (not per phsical qubit, but cost for performance) IonQ will most likely beat them! Comparing them directly right now is pretty hard, because IonQ is to far ahead. Right now, IonQ pays about 2 million in parts and capitalized labour to build a system, not including a sales mark-up and service fees (5). That's hard to beat. Rough estimates put a price tag to IBM's system at \\~15 million, while those are significantly less useful (6).   \n  \n\nConcerning the other technologies:   \n\n\nTheir are about 7 different methods as of right now, but some are still at the early ages.   My main reason why I\u00b4m not concerned for now goes back to costs. Let's assume the other technologies get their first prototype in 10 years. At that point, if we compare the costs of qubits, the early scalers will already see a massive increase in cost savings. It is probably wise to stay informed about new developments, but I didn't stumbled into something that made me seriously worry yet. IonQ expects the per qubit cost to decrease by 90% over the next 5 years (7). Therefore as time goes on, new competing technologies will have a increasingly hard time to keep up. Time is on IonQ's side.     \n\n\nThe main question that arises here is: Why isn't everyone doing Trapped Ions then? The main idea is that Google and IBM went with superconducting qubits, because the manufacturing process is close to conventional chips. Ion Traps just wasn't their circle of expertise. Another question is, why didn't they buy IonQ? I think they tried, but IonQ said no. The founders where initially hesitant to even take private money.   \n    \n    \n(1) https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:199846-2018:TEXT:EN:HTML \n\n(2) Quantum Computing: Progress and Prospects (2019)   \n\n(3) https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4612 \n\n(4) https://www.hpcwire.com/2019/06/05/quantum-upstart-ionq-sets-sights-on-challenging-ibm-rigetti-others/ \n\n(5) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521114527/d138876d425.htm \n\n(6) https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/ibm-q-50-qubit-quantum-computer/ \n\n(7) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521114527/d138876d425.htm \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **8) Smart money is taking notice of IonQ**   \n\n\nI intensively check for the awareness curve when it comes to IonQ. Therefore I compiled a list of FinTwit accounts who are recognising IonQ. The most important part here is that they aren't SPAC investors, but regular investors. I intentinally excluded SPAC investors, to get a sense of how normal investor look at IonQ. One part of them is \u201cSmart Money\u201d, e.g. Wall Street. They need to use burner accounts in order to get compliance of their back. The other part are FinTwit accounts with a following above 5K, e.g. \u201cInfluencers\u201d. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI included cramer here to show that he is \"aware\" of QC. I think he will say something like \"I was always interested in quantum computing\", when I invites a member of IonQ on his show.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zujg2mfxv7971.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59eb21352fb8e1ea7e5c5873a1a70c4d24760914\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **9) IonQ is cheap compared to similar tech companys** \n\nThis part is dedicated to the valuation of IonQ. First of all, in 2018 their was this thing called \u201cQuantum Winter\u201d. For some time, the whole industry struggled to get funding. This suppressed valuations. Without quantum winter, I think we would already see IonQ at atleast double the price, which is nice.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wu1ws1t1w7971.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07e036f926eb04704099ac35f9887cfd840606cd\n\nThe question is as to who you compare IonQ's valuation to.   You can either do it by checking for unprofitable hyper growth stocks or you can try and use forward multiples. The big thing about IonQ is that there doesn't exist a public company yet to compare them directly to. Therefore we will have to see how the public prices them.     \nIf you compare IonQ to other hyper growth stocks, we should see a valuation somewhere between 5-10B. I think this is justified by the story. Right now the EV is at 1.4B. There is no other company that can carry the title \u201cleader in quantum computing\u201d for the next 5 years. The story is there. What I really like about IonQ is that there is also a very good businesses case to make. Some of the meme stocks definitely have a great story. Unfortunately some of them lack the margins, the competitive position and a few other variables that turn a great story into a great business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to value IonQ on forward multiples, the closest thing we have are Nvidia and AMD. The problem I have with this notion is a quote from the nobel prize winner William Phillips: \u201cA quantum computer differs more from a classical computer than a classical computer differs from an abacus\u201d.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8ut2ig4w7971.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=139681528809538488567dccdc97ddd13ae32ea1\n\nAdditionally Nvidia and AMD are in a different product cycle right now, therefore even assuming that those are comparable, still makes it hard to compare them. If you want to do it nevertheless here is the slide:   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9air9lk7w7971.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf288f11ca3471ce32ed338191f827afe7e6b3ca\n\nTwo things concerning the slide: For one, after using the multiples and discounting them, IonQ is trading at a \\~40% discount . Second, just having time passing should generate a return of 20% a year. Therefore, you get paid for waiting until IonQ develops balance sheet momentum. I will talk more about the ability of IonQ to hit milestones in \u201cPredictions\u201d part.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/upmmi82cw7971.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a5eccb4150f30c3f11ad96b3f9a42e5fab46e8\n\n Two things concerning the slide: For one, after using the multiples and discounting them, IonQ is trading at a \\~40% discount .

I will talk more about the ability of IonQ to hit milestones in \u201cPredictions\u201d part.   \n    \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10) IonQ will only have a float of \\~ 250 million after the merger.**   \n\n\nThe PIPE and insiders are all locked out (1). Therefore if the merger creates enough hype in the beginning, this thing will trade like a 250 million market cap company. Why does this matter?   \nThere is a fun trick one can use to price stocks in the short term. We all know the \u201cmarginal buyer and marginal seller\u201d story, but this is kinda hard to quantify. What is really easy to quantify is to ask: \u201cHow much money will people put into this stock\u201d. In our case, I ask: \u201cHow much money will people put into the stock in the first month\u201d We have a float right now of 250 million at 10 per stock. If people collectively decide to put 1B into the stock, we get a stock price of 40. At 2B, we get a price of 80 and so on. Therefore if IonQ gets the meme/hype status that I assume it will get, it can be very profitable to get in early.     \n\n\n(1) https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1824920/000119312521193217/d70340ds4a.htm \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**11) IonQ is a high performance team**   \n\n\nI wanted to include this paragraph because I was checking if I can find any bad blood ex-employees. Anything that indicates that they have internal problems. Therefore I collected what I could find on the internet. What I found was that the  people who work at IonQ seem to have a great collegial connection. Mentally I always kinda connected IonQ to Quantumscape, therefore I wanted to find out if there is anything that indicates that the leadership runs a one man show, is not engaged with the team or anything like this. (Basically to make sure that there is no ammo for a short report)   \nMy two main points I found:  \n\nLeaders in IonQ having a their own secret language going. (Or whatever that is) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/do4vu6agw7971.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae083f7e136a47c8b01a755feb7120e5ef08d77f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ba1ynkkhw7971.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dec696482c89ae173fa00109cc82749faf660990\n\nI'm pretty sure that the hiring of Dave Bacon went like this: Kenneth if there is own person in the world you want to work with, who would that be?   Kenneth Brown, Jungsang Kim and Monroe are the authors of the initial white paper that got IonQ started \n\nEmployees getting matching vanity plates with one of their bosses:   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf4wnqimw7971.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d82dccb0071cf8be639745a43e30c3326a0a5a06\n\nAnother intern talking about the good time at IonQ:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46uq2s0ow7971.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7685b63214ac862784eda9289e68887baa7afc5\n\n I could show some other chatter with people who are not working for IonQ but are working on Ion-Traps, but I want to keep it short.   \n\n  \nI checked glass door as well (1). They have a total of 5 reviews, in a company with about \\~70 employees. Two are positive and 3 are negative. They are all from this year, even though IonQ existed for \\~5 years now. The most common complaint is that they are overworked, followed by underpaid, followed by bad management.  \n\nI think overworked should get better, since they are hiring. At the same time, the past year was probably extremely hard, since they wanted to hit their QV target. Underpaid should get fixed by the capital raise plus they can easily pay people in equity now, which was mentioned by the CEO. Concerning the management, I can see Chapman (CEO) being very ambitious when it comes to timelines. He is a software guy and not a hardware guy, so it is hard for him to judge how long stuff takes. Keep in mind that the founders are the science guys and the \u201cmanagement\u201d is external. I have this idea that Chapman came into the company and saw that it was too easy for IonQ. I think that made him push harder. It's like a soccer team winning all the championships without hard practice.     \n\n\nThe only person that where I once found a non glassdoor complaint was the contractor who put together the slides for a investor presentation. He said he didn't get paid. IonQ immediately messaged him to figure it out. I think this was more or less one of those problems that just occur. IonQ didn't have a CFO nor the classical company structure at that time and I can see that just being victim of the special organisational structure that IonQ used to have.   \n    \nAnother thing I wanted to check was to find out why people left IonQ. My main idea is that they simply didn't have anything new to contribute. The science part is mostly done for IonQ. Pure scientists are not needed anymore. I think about John Preskill (big deal in the QC world) for example, who used to be an advisor. He now works for Amazon, who is still doing the \u201cfundamental work\u201d Another one is the ex-president of Bell Labs, who served on the board. IonQ needs engineers now. Ex CEO founded his own company. (He wasn't part of the original team, IonQ just needed a \u201cmanager\u201d). I couldn't find any movement of ex key employees that I considered suspicious. \n\nOne journalist wrote: \u201cIonQ does the right things at the right time\u201d(2) This also includes getting the right people onboard.      \nAt some point, the fact that IonQ behaves like a high performance team is no surprise. I think this is a necessary condition to constantly hit those results. Therefore this is no coincidence. It's fun to watch nevertheless.      \n  \n\n(1) https://www.glassdoor.de/Overview/Working-at-IonQ-EI\\_IE2421266.11,15.htm?countryRedirect=true \n\n(2)  https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2021/03/23/ionq-takes-quantum-computing-public-with-a-2-billion-deal/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **12) The bull case is easy to understand and to follow.**   \n\n  \nSome tech companies that are going public right now or that have been public for a while have tech that is not easy to put in a nutshell. Therefore following their progress can be extremely difficult for someone who is not in the industry. In the case of IonQ, even a normal person can follow! There is 1 gate fidelity, 2 gate fidelity and qubit count. You put them together by checking for connectivity, which gives you the performance. You do the same thing once we are in the phase of error-correction. There is one technical breakthrough on the horizon, which can also be quantified by checking 2 gate fidelity (photonic network). At last, you need to check if the clock speed is fast enough so that the qubits stay in superposition long enough. (This is more or less a yes or no question). Once you have an intuitive understanding what those things are, you are good to go! Just check where they are at and you know the progress.   \nKnowing those few things will allow you to do a rudimentary \u201cBayesian updating\u201d (ascribing a new probability to outcomes based on the result of past outcomes) when it comes to checking the progress of IonQ and the rest of the industry.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **13) The IonQ meme has not been meme'd**   \n\n\nFor those of you who didn't here about quantum computing before: This one of the most hyped technologies on the horizon. It stands next  to fusion energy, strong AI, full self driving, blockchain, you name it. Their is also a good chunk of commentary on the hype itself. In order to get an idea where it stands, I used Google trends as a proxy for the hype.   \n\n\nWhat I try to capitalize on with my call options is the disconnect between the quantum computing hype and the knowledge about IonQ. Once those two things converge, we should see the price action.   \n\n\nLet's try to gauge the hype! \n\nFirst I compare quantum computer to solid state battery.\n\nSecond I compare Quantumscape to solid state battery. \n\nThird I compare IonQ to quantum computer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSolid state battery to quantum computer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fr15a49tw7971.png?width=1452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95b926cc9d31f2b8f826beef5c7e7412a00d8f5e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuantumscape to solid state battery. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jvnytfuw7971.png?width=1430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c0b1c38b0f1cfa120389520444203e72a4640b0\n\nIonQ to quantum computer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0u0hkpfvw7971.png?width=1445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a2d2ab73eb97d9b70fc1f36296ad7cac0c8641\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hype:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plcp37y2x7971.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbcccd0929df12a75b19c6f20d0293e66cb7bceb\n\nFurther evidence of the disconnect between the quantum computing hype and IonQ can be seen if you google something like: \u201cWhat companies are doing quantum computing stuff\u201d. Some of those companies mentioned in those articles don't even have a serious quantum effort, while IonQ is unmentioned. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**14) IonQ's predictions are reliable as long as they are useful** \n\nIn this section, I will look at two sources of predictions. One is based on press releases, one is based on a video. \n\nFirst press releases: They don't make many prediction here, but the few they made are:   \n(July 2017) IonQ plans to bring general-purpose quantum computers to market by late 2018. (1) \n\n(July 2017) Within a year, IonQ expects to have quantum computing systems available for commercial use via the cloud with about 30 reliable, scalable qubits to start, Dr. Moehring said. (2)   \n  \n\n\u2192 IonQ breaks records for quantum computing performance. (December 2018)                                  (They don't have an announcement when it went on the cloud)   \n  \n\n(June 2019) IonQ plans to double its qubit count roughly every year. (3)   \u2192\n\n(To be seen) They will demonstrate their optical network this year(4):   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe original roadmap. A victim of the great benchmarking shift. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bj6dnp5ex7971.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87312bcbb90cdf0bd75e4a7b70fb3d5e16f02159\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see in the above picture, the roadmap used to consist of physical qubit number and single gate fidelity. The number of gates referred to single qubit gates. The \u201cobjective\u201d used to be Quantum Supremacy. \n\nThen the benchmarking shift happened. Quantum Volume was introduced. Therefore, now what mattered was the interplay between 2 qubit gate fidelity, number of qubits and connectivity. In order for IonQ to go with the time, they needed to present their success based on slightly different metrics. They didn't need a huge amount of qubits anymore, and the single qubit gate fidelity doesn't matter at all for quantum volume. Therefore they pushed quality over quantity, to show their competitiveness. The new objective for them is quantum advantage, which means that you rather use a quantum computer for certain tasks. Quantum Supremacy is nice for academic purposes, while Quantum Advantage makes you money. This is what ultimately allowed them to make the claim today to have the best quantum computer. They need funding after-all, so they need to go with the time.     \n\n\nIf we then my ask, well what would they have done differently if quantum volume never came along? They would have focused on ion shuttling and the optical network, in order to get more qubits connected. They will demonstrate the optical network in a industrial setting this year. I have no information when it comes to Ion Shuttling.   \n\n\nIn the end, they will need the full kid anyway. What changed was the order in which they achieve the different kinds of objectives.   \n\n\n(1) https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ionq-raises-20m-series-b-round-led-by-nea-gv-to-advance-quantum-computing-for-commercial-applications-300494456.html \n\n(2) https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-trapped-ions-could-lead-to-better-quantum-performance-1501074264?tesla=y \n\n(3) https://www.hpcwire.com/2019/06/05/quantum-upstart-ionq-sets-sights-on-challenging-ibm-rigetti-others/ \n\n(4) https://www.zdnet.com/article/ionq-ceo-peter-chapman-on-quantum-computing-adoption-innovation-and-whats-next/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**15) This is not just a liquidity event for investors, since IonQ is in need of the IPO money and the investors have a strategic interest** \n\n  \nTo be clear, I can see some of the investors taking profit. The ownership on IonQ is split between tech companies and Wall Street. Wall Street might be looking to take profits, but the strategic investors like Google, Amazon, Samsung etc. have a strategic interest in staying involved. IonQ is their ticket to Ion-Tap quantum computers. For those tech companies that have their own quantum program, IonQ is the way to diversify. I think it is unlikely that they will be quick to take a profit as long as the story doesn't change or the price becomes unreasonable. Tech companies can not afford to be not invested.   \n\n\nNow let's look at the need for money for IonQ.   \nYou can split this up into 4 areas where they need to have a big war chest.   \n\n\n1) They are hiring right now. Since IonQ is starting to scale, they need employees with a vast amount of experience and a specialised skill set. Those people aren't cheap and need job security. If you are a 50 year old engineer, you don't want to work for a startup that promisses you pay by giving out stock option. You need job security. IonQ can guarantee that by having the war chest ready. This is especially important if you look at other places like Google, who are also hiring. The cash increase levels the playing field.   \n\n\n2) Brute forcing results. There are two ways of getting stuff done. One is to think it through and find the best solution for a problem using brain power. The other way is simply trying it out until you find the right way. The trial and error method is costly. Not having enough resources to use this method puts you at a disadvantage. At the same time, telling a potential employee that he can \u201clet loose\u201d is a dream for those people.   \n\n3) Suppliers need security. Once IonQ starts mass production, they will outsource the chips. The suppliers building those need to be sure that IonQ has the cash to pay them. This way the suppliers can comfortably free resources for this task.   \n\n\n4) IonQ will most likely consolidate the industry. As you might imagine, IonQ is not the only company involved. At the same time, being in the lead gives them two advantages. People have an incentive to join them, since other quantum computing companies might not survive. The other advantage is that they stand ready to buy their patents or the whole company, once they give up. In order to flexible here, they need cash.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finnaly:**\n\n**Bear Case of the internet**   \n    \nIn this part, I will start with the strongest bear case I have read so far. The next part will be a more more of a collection of criticism that I came along.   \nThis bear case was brought forth by Fernando Brandao on twitter. He is the Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology and the Head of Quantum Algorithms at Amazon Web Services. Smart guy but also part of the competition. \n\n I will just copy the thread here: Since those are well ordered, I will go over my counter argument step by step   \n(0) IonQ latest announcement with their roadmap is out: https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ionq-plans-to-launch-a-rack-mounted-quantum-computer-for-data-centers-in-2023/. Also check Peter Chapman talk on Q2B 2020 for similar content. The thread below hopefully will foster more discussion by the community. Disclaimer: all I write reflects only my personal opinion 1/20     \n\n\nIonQ claims to have today 22 qubits, all-to-all coupling, and 2-qubit error rates of 0.4% (achieving quantum volume of 4 millions). It\u2019s a big improvement over their latest published result of 11 qubits with 2.5% error rate (https://nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13534-2). 2/20   \n\n\n*My part: The qubit 2-qubit error rates they are claiming is 0.1% and they say they will achieve 0.04% in the future. 0.04% would add 3 zeros to the quantum volume claim. I think he messed up the zeros after the comma as well. It's 0.1% now resulting in a quantum volume above 4 million. I think this was an honest mistake in the heat of the moment.* (1)   \n\n\nIn their previous PR on October 2020, Chapman also said: \"In a single generation of hardware, we went from 11 to 32 qubits, and more importantly, improved the fidelity required to use all 32 qubits,\". I look forward seeing data on the experiments, which is not available yet. 3/20     \n\n\n*My part: They will publish the data, but they say it's more important right now to make the QC constantly hit those numbers. (Remember me talking about Honeywell in the beginning).* *They already published a paper that indicates that they can hit those numbers.(2)*   \n\n\nHere's a plot of their roadmap. \u201cAlgorithmic qubits\u201d in their plot means log\\_2(q. vol). By 2028, depth 1014 circuits on 1014 qubits. That would be amazing progress, but does it get us to useful applications of quantum computing? 4/20     \nChapman says: \u201cAs soon as you hit about 40 algorithmic qubits (...), you\u2019ll start to see quantum advantage probably in machine learning\u201d. Unlikely! QML is far into the future if ever. Also one can still easily simulate circuits on 40 qubits classically. 5/20     \nChapman also says: \u201cAnd then, I think it\u2019s pretty well accepted that at 72 qubits is roughly when you start to do quantum advantage fairly broadly\u201d. Not true! There are a few known applications for qubit counts close to 72, but one needs circuits of depth &gt;&gt;100k for that. 6/20     \nWith 72 \u201calgorithm qubits\u201d we can only run circuits of depth 72. You might hope for early advantage with variational/hybrid methods, but that\u2019s just a hope from today's facts. Depth 72 seems pretty small even assuming variational methods will eventually work. 7/20     \nHe continues: \u201cSo that would be in 2025. When you start to get into 2027, you\u2019re now getting into hundreds of qubits if not early 1000s of qubits in \\[2028\\]. And now you\u2019re starting to get into full-scale fault tolerance\u201d. 8/20     \nDepth-1000 circuits on 1000 qubits would be awesome progress, but far from what we believe is required for applications and what full-scale fault-tolerance would give. Ultimately we want a good number of qubits that we can run very, very!, long circuits on. 9/20     \n\n\n*My part: All those points refer to the question: \u201cWhen do quantum computers become useful?\u201d. Initially I assumed that someone can just tell me a number of qubits that they need to run an algorithm and I know. Unfortunately, this is not the case.(3)* \n\n*There are 2 ways of determining when QC will create value when it comes to algorithms. One is theoretical, one is practical. Theoretically you can \u201cmath out\u201d at what point a quantum computer can do useful things. Just check the equation and you know how many qubits you need for an idealised problem. People who are bearish can quote those numbers and say: QC will take forever and is useless for most problems.* *One guy in this camp is him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEgBdWQdvfk. (min 43:22)* *He says: Don't believe anyone who claims that quantum computers can solve the travelling salesman problem\u201d*   *Theoretical this is most likely true, IF you choose to talk about the hardest possible instance.*   \n\n*Practically, the world doesn't create the hardest instances of problems. At the same time, we use \u201capproximations\u201d for those problems today, that aren't \u201cclear cut\u201d in their mathematics.*   *People who actually work with those real life instances will tell you that real life instances are solvable by Quantum computers and we can get an advantage of using them.*   *This guy is one of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmtVNuAQMM0 (min 11:30)* *My argument is basically his argument. He is a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley working with Umesh Vazirani (who is an advisor for IonQ). He completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT under the guidance of Scott Aaronson (Who is a authority in the field).*     \n\n\nIonQ plans to get 64 \u201calg. qubits\u201d using 16 physical qubits to encode 1 logical qubit. I assume they plan to use Bacon-Shor codes, building on the beautiful recent paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11482). But details of their scheme for FT computation are not available yet. 10/20     \nsays: \u201cother technologies, because of their poor gate fidelity and qubit connectivity, might need 1,000, 10,000 or even 1,000,000 qubits to create a single error-corrected qubit.\u201d 11/20     \n100-1,000 overhead is the estimated number required to get very small error rates (&lt; 10\\^-10), capable of running useful algorithms. 12/20     \n\n\n*My part: All of this concerns error correction. \u201c100-1,000 overhead is the estimated number required to get very small error rates\u201d IF you have a very low (if not the minimum) of physical errors. IonQ doesn't calculate their overhead using the minimal physical error rate, so if they compare themselves to others, why should they assume the minimum for others and not themselves?*     \n\n\nIons are not different! If their physical 2-qubit error rate is &gt;0.1%, they will also require similar overheads. Right now, with IonQ current 2-qubit error rates of &gt;1.5%, error correction is not possible even with unbounded overhead. 13/20     \n\n\n*My part: 1.4% is the biggest gate they have (the worst gate so to speak) and they are predicting their overhead based on the 99.6% average 2 gate fidelity. Fernando later says that he was quoting the numbers from their older system (Gen 4)?. Ok. We need to keep in mind that IonQ has some of the best experts on error correction in their company. I think they know when error correction is possible and when it is not possible.*   \n    \nIonQ has long argued that scaling its technology doesn\u2019t necessitate any technological breakthroughs\u201d. To scale &gt;30 qubits, IonQ plans to use optical interconnects between different ions traps. That is an old idea, but has shown to be very challenging to get it right. 14/20     \nSeems IonQ is giving itself 5 years to figure it out. Experts have been trying to do it for at least 10 years. While I hope IonQ will pull it off in the fullness of time, functional optical interconnects are a major tech breakthrough required for ions scalability. 15/20     \n \n\n*My part: It has been demonstrated in the lab already and IonQ will demonstrate it this year in a industrial setting.(4)*   \n\n\nIt would be great if IonQ was upfront about it and reported on their progress towards optical interconnects. If anyone can do it, I believe it's them! 16/20   \n\n*My part: Yes, they will do it this year.(4)*   \n\n\nI have deep respect for IonQ scientists and I think they have the right to be excited about their approach as much as anyone else. It\u2019s still early days for everyone and all different platforms have to circumvent major technical challenges for scalability. 17/20     \n\n\n*My Part: Those technical challenges are not similarly hard. There is a difference between a white paper and the best performing prototype*.   \n\n\nBut I question if the over-the-top, never-ending, PR campaign of the company in recent years is the right approach to give value to its customers and help the world realize the dream of scalable quantum computers. 18/20     \n\n\n*My part: What PR campaign? Never heard about them before the IPO. They didn't publicly claim quantum supremacy even though they say they did it before Google. (5) (I know that this a a touchy subject, but Google didn't care that it was disputable when they came out with it). It's not in their press releases either. Their last QC did beat all the others QC on the benchmarks, when it came out.(6) I think it's fine to put that on the website. First quantum simulation of a water molecule?(7) They did that. Nature articles? (8)*     \n\n\nTo all our community (and unrelated to my comments on IonQ): we should be very grateful of all the investment our field is getting. But we have the responsibility of keeping hype down. 19/20     \nThe focus must be on tech and science development, not on vanity and greed. We owe it to the future generations of quantum scientists, investors and end-users. 20/20     \n\n\n*My part: (Unrelated to what he said in the last part) Monroe doesn't have any stock and pays himself close to nothing. (9) He himself was initially hesitant to take investor money, because he didn't want to be an \u201cindustry sell out\u201d (I here this term a lot on Quantum Twitter). I think allocating money to IonQ is probably not the worse use for money in general. I'm well aware that this will eventually lead to other groups receiving less money, since IonQ is setting the bar pretty high, but that's not IonQ's fault.* *I think Kenneth Brown doesn't even get a salary. Jungsang Kim and Peter Chapman are the only once that have classical stock. (9)They didn't yet publish what the stock based compensation looks like.*     \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n**Now I will focus on the three biggest criticisms brought forth**: Number one is their quantum volume claim, number two is the roadmap, number three is the clock speed.   \n    \nQuantum Volume Claim: \u201cthe statement fails basic sanity checking\u201d an editor wrote on Wikipedia, referring to the QV claim by IonQ (13). I think this just shows how far IonQ got in a short amount of time and how unlikely it is that people will catch up to them soon. The other paper they published indicates that they can hit the QV    \n\n\nRoadmap: I'm not sure why people complain about the roadmap, since Google and PsiQuantum have basically the same roadmap. I'm not saying they can do it, I'm just saying they are claiming it.   \u201cGood guy Google, presenting a timeline that is realistic and devoid of hyperboles, crazy made-up numbers, and extrapolated plots. \u201c (14)  Dude, it's the same roadmap. Google is even more optimistic than IonQ. Concerning the plausibility of the roadmap of IonQ. Their are 2 things that need to happen and IonQ is done. One is miniaturisation, the other is the optical network. They already have the right amount of numbers of qubits that allow for error correction on the chip. The miniaturisation will decrease the physical error further, since the laser doesn't need to travel that far anymore. They need an increase of 0.06% of 2 gate fidelity. Keep in mind that they went from 97.5% to 99.9% in \\~ 2 years while increasing the number of qubits(15). Now they want to get to 99.96 with the same number of qubits.  Additionally, the miniaturisation has already been demonstrated. This is not that hard.  The other thing is the optical network. They will demonstrate it this year in a industrial setting (16). This has also been show in the lab already.   Once they got those 2 things done, they will start mass production and are done. Mass producing those things is not that hard, since nothing about them is \u201cquantum\u201d.    \n\n\nClock speed: Clock speed refers to how fast you can do gates. Their are two things to consider here: One is the \u201cgeneral speed\u201d. I don't really care how fast the QC is, as long as it can perform. QC are already really fast. The second, more interesting point is that you need to perform the Gate fast enough, so that the qubits stay in superposition. This could be a problem, but up until it wasn't the limiting factor. I have heard no one make an argument that this will limit the capabilities in the future.      \n    \n\n\n(1) https://ionq.com/algorithmic-qubit-calculator/  and https://ionq.com/news/october-01-2020-most-powerful-quantum-computer \n\n(2) https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11482 \n\n(3) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmtVNuAQMM0 (4) https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10841 and https://www.zdnet.com/article/ionq-ceo-peter-chapman-on-quantum-computing-adoption-innovation-and-whats-next/ \n\n(5) https://www.afr.com/technology/why-google-wasn-t-really-the-first-to-achieve-quantum-supremacy-20190927-p52vg6 \n\n(6) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Lg1nSd6Y min 10:50 \n\n(7) https://ionq.com/news/february-26-2019 \n\n(8) https://ionq.com/resources/publications \n\n(9) https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824920/000119312521098621/d70340ds4.htm \n\n(10) https://jqi.umd.edu/news/quantum-bit/2013/11/25/coherence-time-survival-quantum-state \n\n(11) https://www.nature.com/articles/npjqi201634 \n\n(12) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a00GwjvFhw&amp;t=420s (min 3:53) \n\n(13) https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum\\_volume&amp;action=history \n\n(14) https://twitter.com/anuragsaharoy/status/1394745248799023105 \n\n(15) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13534-2 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you want to discuss anything I wrote, go for it!** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I'm long 6200 commons, 1360 of the 20c 10/15 and 400 of the 15c 10/15.",

        "selftext": "So I've been watching a bunch of youtube videos about options and see this LEAPS strategy that looks interesting.

I'm currently looking at dec 17 2021.  So with a call option, I guess it makes sense to find a price lower than 53.32.   \n\n\nSo if I have strike prices between 25-50, i find the corresponding Ask price and multiply by 100 and thats what I'd pay for the option?   \n\n\nso a $25 SP has an ask at 28.80  and 50SP has ask of 6.90.   \n\n\nSo I pay between $2880 and $690 and get 100 shares of Arkf?  \n\n\nBut then what? Do I just wait till Dec 17, and hope it doesnt drop below $25. Or am I hoping it exceeds $25-$50?   \n\n\nWhen that date comes and I'm still holding,  that just means I purchase the stocks at the $25-$50 price I correct?   \n\n\nDoes this mean I can't sell until Dec 17th? if say the stock goes to $80?   \n\n\nI'm just confused when and how I gain my profits. Or what would create a loss.   \n\n\nI'm using the chart on Fidelity but I'm not sure what open INT or imp vol is yet, but I'm still learning.",

        "selftext": "In February 2021 I tried to get my Roth IRA and IRA transferred over from New York life to Vanguard. Sometime in March, I had called vanguard and asked for an update. The guy told me that \u201cno news is good news.\u201d So, I waited. In May, I reached out to NYL and asked what was going on on their side. They looked into and said that Vanguard filled out the paperwork incorrectly. I reached back out to Vanguard and they supposedly corrected the issues and we were on our way to getting the accounts transferred. So, I waited. Well, I just checked and see that the Roth has been transferred to vanguard as of June but the IRA is still with NYL and they said that they have no transfer request paperwork from Vanguard for it. I spent 2.5 hours yesterday on hold with Vanguard trying to talk to someone. Finally, I am able to talk to someone (in the wrong department) who told me that they were super busy since they were closed on Monday for the holiday and to call back on Friday because wait times shouldn\u2019t be as bad then. I tried calling the number he gave me, this morning but again was on hold for 20 minutes and had to hang up. \nMy question is: do I continue to put up with this BS from Vanguard and get the IRA transferred over? Should I move the IRA to Fidelity and leave the Roth with Vanguard? Should I move everything to Vanguard? \nI am super annoyed about the situation because it shouldn\u2019t take 5 months to do this.

        "selftext": "#what?\n\nAcorns is an app that's most-popular among young people. In a lot of ways it's \"baby's first investing app\"\n\nThe median age of an Acorns user is 35 as a result. This means that they're attracting the youngest of investors. \n\n- Why does this matter? Because they're building an ecosystem from a young age. How many of you use Fidelity or Schwab because \"well it's what I have\" and it's worked just fine for you?\n\nBut what good is all that if they're losing their subscribers? Thankfully, Acorns has a 98% retention rate.\n\nhttps://www.forex.com/en/market-analysis/latest-research/everything-you-need-to-know-about-acorns/\n\n- This tells us that those who start with Acorns tend to keep with it. \n\nAnd did I say lose subscribers? How about increasing subscribers by almost **50%** in a year.\n\n&gt;As of March 2021, Acorns had more than 6.8 million users, up from 4.6 million in the previous year. 1 million of those accounts held IRAs through the platform.\n\nThe 1 million IRAs is also significant. Acorns is developing a full gamut of financial services: banking, retirement, and direct deposit. They're evolving from the juvenile app that they began as.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/090516/how-acorns-works-and-makes-money.asp\n\n&gt;Acorns only realized $71 million in 2020 revenue but projects $126 million this year and $309 million in 2023, The Wall Street Journal reports.  \n\nHigh degrees of growth and low overhead. Are these projections unreasonable? Based on a 50% user-growth rate I have to say no. \n\nAnother thing is to provide context: $71 million isn't a huge number at all. But it's for a product-less (physically) sector. \n\n- Context: Stripe will be going public near $100 Billion. Their revenue in 2020 was 20x Acorn's. Putting a similar valuation:revenue comp, acorns would be worth ~5 Billion. And that would increase to ~8 Billion based on 2021's numbers and growth, should Acorns be able to achieve their goals.\n\n#buy-in\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/acorns/ - a 31,000 member subreddit dedicated to this specific app. Not sure any other financial app can boast a similar level of excitement.\n\n- Comparison: Fidelity 16,000 members / Schwab 7,000 members / SoFi 7,000 members\n\n#expansion\n\nAs I've mentioned - they're developing new financial tools to offer their customers. Including a debit card. But they're lookign beyond the traditional scope of financial services:\n\n&gt;In October 2020, Acorns announced that it was partnering with online job market ZipRecruiter. The partnership will allow Acorns' users to browse and apply for jobs within its app.\n\nIn looking to create a massive ecosystem of tens of millions of users, Acorns is trying to become a one-stop-shop for all things related to money.\n\n#stability\n\nWall Street loves one thing more than anything. And that's money. Okay... but second on that list is stability. A constant, growing subscriber-base with money coming in each and every month positions Acorns in a very good spot in regards to how investors will view it.\n\n-------------\n\nWill be going public at a valuation of $2.2 Billion. A little pricey but you have to understand that a little over $600 million will be cash from the merger along with PIPE. \n\nAnd again... is the valuation too high? -\n\n&gt;When NBCUniversal made its $105 million investment in acorns in 2019, the valuation was at $860 million.\n\nBased on subscriber growth and an increase in financial services being offered by Acorns, I think this is very in-line with that valuation. And it shows the growth potential, as well.\n\n#name recognition\n\nI know some of you have told me Acorns is pretty new to you but with 5 million+ downloads on the Play Store and 750,000 reviews on the App Store (couldn't find a downloads #) it's one of the more well-known apps which gives it a great footing and with high ratings on both stores along with the high-level of retention. It doesn't seem like they're doing anything wrong.\n\n\nFinally - here's Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson as a spokesman for Acorns. And who doesn't love what the Rock is cooking?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhSPWMpFMh8",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 9, 2021**\n\nThe stock market pulled a remarkable turnaround today, shaking off yesterday\u2019s declines with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rocketing to another record intraday high, led by the financial and energy sectors, which had been lagging as of late and continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. It seems that after a brief flare-up of concerns regarding the coronavirus delta variant and a potential acceleration of the timeline to taper quantitative easing in the US, fears have greatly tempered. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 1.27% while the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.6% and is very slightly below it\u2019s all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, led the day, rising more than 2%.\n\nIn recent weeks, market participants are increasingly trying to gauge if the surge we are seeing in the more contagious coronavirus delta variant will weigh on global growth rates. Yesterday, it seems concerns came to a head after the Japanese government made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. The state of emergency will begin on Monday and run through Aug. 22, while the games are scheduled from July 23 to Aug. 8. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections, according to the CDC. According to reports, as of yesterday, only 16.8% of the Japanese population was vaccinated against the virus. \n\nIn other news, in another move that raised concerns about the global growth rate, China\u2019s central bank signalled it will be cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China\u2019s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy\u2019s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.\n\nKen Cheung, Chief Asian Foreign Exchange Strategist at Mizuho, said \u201cThe PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the Chinese economy. Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over China\u2019s growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming Q2 GDP figures in the coming week\u201d. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.\n\nWhile these global concerns did jitter the market yesterday, the impressive recovery in US equities underscores the remarkable strength of its economy, as the country continues reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, with 48% of the population fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In my opinion, while the delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, and the market may react negatively to headlines about it, the foundations of the recovery in the US (i.e nation-wide reopening measures, a rapidly improving labor market, record earnings from companies, and a high level of savings among Americans) are very strong and will continue to underpin a bull market here. \n\n**Highlights** \n\n* The recent sell-off in crude oil recovered, with the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settling higher by 2.2% to $74.56 per barrel at the time of writing.\n* Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, reached a new all-time high today. \n* President Biden is expected to sign an executive agreement ordering the Federal Trade Commission to limit or ban noncompete agreements, unnecessary occupational licenses, and revise guidance for sharing wage information between the HR department and workers and other employers. \n* Tesla (TSLA), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said Friday they would work together on a new initiative to create the nation's most sustainable residential community. The companies said the provisionally named SunHouse at Easton Park in Austin, Texas, would be the first Tesla Solar neighborhood.\n* On Monday, a trial will kick off in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware between Elon Musk and shareholders. The plaintiffs alleged that Musk used his control at Tesla to force the company to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in order to protect his investment in the company from bankruptcy and want Musk to pay that money back to Tesla. IMO seems a little weird to me to sue about this given that SolarCity has proven to be a good acquisition for Tesla.\n* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly in early talks with the NFL to buy the rights to stream Sunday Night games for their streaming service. A while ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought the right to stream Thursday NFL games for Prime Video. \n* Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow, opened in theaters last night and is expected to be the biggest opening since 2019, with the film projected to bring around $80 million domestically. This is huge and a sign that Americans' appetite to go to movie-theaters is very real. Personally, I\u2019m going to go watch in the theaters this weekend. \n* Foxconn, a well known supplier for Apple, is discussing plans with Fisker (FSR) to open a factory to build EV\u2019s in Wisconsin. In a statement, the company said, \u201cFoxconn has engaged the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to discuss the company's plans for electric vehicle manufacturing. Foxconn is optimistic about our partnership with WEDC and looks forward to ongoing discussions\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Aptiv (APTV) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $170 to $182 at Buy.

        "selftext": "It was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE for a long time.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for investors with a longer view who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes\\_value\\_creation\\_trajectory\\_is\\_very\\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/)\n\n(3) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(4) [https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(5) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9)  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10)  Global Capital link removed due to forbidden word in the url. \n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n\n(13)  [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(14) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(15) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(16) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)",

        "selftext": "# DEAR APES,\n\nAnother weekly update on AMD.\n\nSince my last post, we broke $90 and came up to $95... now we hit Wave 4, as we get ready **RISE**!\n\nIf you know anything about Elliot Wave (I suggest you research it)... Wave 4 is here.\n\nBasically, we will consolidate for a couple of days before the **sky-rocketing WAVE 5** towards $97.97.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**On the Technical Analysis:** \"I heart stock charts\" on youtube does a great job following AMD.\n\nHe anticipated yesterday's drop (Wave 4, with a 4% drop) and even today's continuation to $89.49. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf6LNcUP-L0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf6LNcUP-L0)\n\nBut this drop is expected, as part of a Wave 4... and Before WAVE 5.\n\nThe target remains $97.97.... and even aiming to break the $100 mark (a new all-time high).\n\n[Wave 4 to drop to $89.49 before bouncing back...](https://preview.redd.it/93pnyw1010a71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b4036d9f97d3b8ef5c01759ca50d69cff0913ff)\n\n**On the FUNDAMENTALS:**\n\nObviously, the Elliot WAVE pushes upwards as a result of fundamentals... (that **fuel** the rise).\n\nThere's interesting news since my last post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #1- Intel announced a DELAY on its 7nm manufacturing plan.\n\nThis is great news for AMD: [https://www.protocol.com/intel-7nm-chip-delay](https://www.protocol.com/intel-7nm-chip-delay)\n\n[INTEL announced a NEW delay on its 7nm process](https://preview.redd.it/p77kemk630a71.jpg?width=1159&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccb08ed1567ee4f1b6d9b9c77c315da5d9b3c3b4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #2- AMD consumer sales remain STRONG (Amazon)\n\nHere's today's sales chart, directly from AMAZON... where AMD dominates the TOP 10.\n\n[AMD has 8 positions from the Top 10 sales](https://preview.redd.it/6g6uuy1w30a71.jpg?width=1882&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b36234479fc5dafef09b0d277d4712c11d4b0aa2)\n\nInteresting to note the amount of reviews AMD products receive in contrast to the 2 Intel chips.\n\nI've highlighted in the color boxes the AMD chip review numbers vs Intel.\n\nIn short, Intel has a total 3,222 combined reviews on their #7 and #8 spots.\n\nWhile AMD has 101,795 reviews. Consumers are **VERY HAPPY** with AMD products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #3- AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution to GROW (July 16th).\n\nAs reported by Coreteks yesterday, more games will receive AMD FX Super Resolution next week.\n\nIn addition, the Radeon 6600XT is planned for launch next month (August).\n\nAs per his estimates, FSR will let you hit **60 FPS** at **4K** with **Ultra Quality** on the 6600XT.\n\n[Coreteks' report](https://preview.redd.it/q2w48evd50a71.jpg?width=1897&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e91039f1f2749acc5ca92c1e639a61a54821110)\n\n**Coretek's awesome video**: : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msNiyDsDVsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msNiyDsDVsA)\n\nThis is awesome news for AMD's entry GPU... which will be **SOLD-OUT immediately** on launch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #4 - AMD grows on SuperComputer Ranking (NEW June list)\n\nAs reported recently, Intel has been dropping in the SuperComputer (Datacenter) market.\n\n[INTEL falls in Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/twtkltha60a71.jpg?width=1670&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abc32d39542548206263b8f3d879b76db04521be)\n\nArticle: [https://www.networkworld.com/article/3623750/intel-stumbles-in-supercomputer-rankings-delays-next-gen-cpu.html](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3623750/intel-stumbles-in-supercomputer-rankings-delays-next-gen-cpu.html)\n\nIn addition, there's a **really good video** from ServeTheHome ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd1H-I-i-68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd1H-I-i-68)), where he analyzed the latest SuperComputers list.\n\n[AMD Walloped Intel on June's 2021 Top 500 SuperComputer List](https://preview.redd.it/c6mmrga570a71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ff78b30908f538b62063825d9bc9847f89f9d36)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# #5 - Valuation versus NVIDIA: AMD is still CHEAP\n\nToday, AMD's real competitor is NVIDIA.\n\nFrom a market capitalization perspective, NVIDIA trades at roughly $500 billion.\n\nWhile AMD is trading at $108 billion... a fifth of NVIDIA's size.\n\nThis is ridiculously cheap, at AMD's P/E ratio is much lower and the future outlook is great.\n\nWhile NVIDIA's acquisition of ARM is still being questioned by huge players (Google, etc.)... AMD received **green lights from EVERYONE** to acquire XILINX.\n\nThis acquisition will be great for AMD, as the automotive sector goes through a revolution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# To summarize:\n\n**#1- INTEL continues to have delays on 7nm**\n\n**#2- AMD continues to dominate the Consumer CPU market**\n\n**#3- AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution increasing ADOPTION by developers. GPU launch soon!**\n\n**#4- AMD continues to GROW in Datacenter... kicking INTEL's rear.**\n\n**#5 - AMD still CHEAP versus NVIDIA**\n\n# WE ONLY NEED TO RIDE OUT WAVE 4 and pack our bananas...\n\n# WAVE 5... HERE WE COME!!!\n\nUp-vote, comment, challenge or ask questions. **Rewards are welcome!**",

        "selftext": "Anyone else having issues with RH app not letting you leave? I have made three attempts at transferring my stocks into Fidelity since the boycott, however each time has been unsuccessful. Most recently, the transaction was canceled due to restrictions placed by RH.\n\nA little background about myself, I just started dabbling into stocks about a year ago. I am not a pro and have only made a couple trades. I have no addition money in my RH bank, I don't owe RH anything, and I haven't even sold through RH. It is unclear what the restriction could be, but it worries me because I do have stock in AMC?\n\nAnyways I emailed RH in the beginning of the year and never recieved a response. Their website has no number to call, and I just sent them a second email with my concerns. I am not confident that RH will even respond back to me, and if they don't then this situation is slowly inching towards illegal territory, in my opinion.\n\nHas anyone experienced this before, and can offer any advice?\n\nThank you.",

        "selftext": "I keep hearing about how Robinhood is not really commission-free since order fills are poor due to their use of PFOF. Just watched a couple YouTube videos on PFOF and the argument against it makes sense. But are there any examples or evidence (YouTube videos/articles/etc.) of PFOF working against the retail trader?\nI would think it would be easy to demonstrate but I\u2019m not finding anything. If a market order was submitted at the exact same time on RH vs a broker like fidelity, wouldn\u2019t fidelity always provide the better price since it doesn\u2019t use PFOF?\nAlso, it seems that the majority of brokers accept PFOF, so why is this always an argument against robinhood?",

Since the position was opened as a spread but then I rolled only the short strike, it treated it as selling a naked call (even though I'm not even trading at an options level 5 at Fidelity which allows for naked options on indices). The day trade call is a stupid high amount that I can't meet so now it's going to trigger a day trade violation on my account and restrict my intraday buying power for 90 days.

The deal is expected to deliver up to $691 million in gross proceeds to the combined company, including as much as 276 million of cash held in [Concord Acquisition Corp](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=640562596)'s trust account.\n\nWhen the combination is completed, existing Circle shareholders will maintain about 86% ownership of the new public entity, the companies said.\n\nCircle's co-founder, Jeremy Allaire, is set to remain chief executive of the company, while Bob Diamond, chairman of Concord Acquisition and CEO of Atlas Merchant Capital will join the board.\n\nConcord Acquisition raised $276 million in its initial public offering last December and listed on NYSE.",

For it to make sense to me, the company must provide me with a large near-term upside and continued long-term growth. Basically, I am looking for penny stocks that should not be. Newlox Gold fits my requirements, I am not a financial advisor, I am a mom and a professional firefighter, do your own DD. I believe that* *if you find the technology, the money will follow and that high quality research builds conviction*\\*. *I write DDs on all of my long holds, they can be found on the subreddit named after me. I hold a million shares of Newlox Gold which I have no plans to sell within the next five years.*\n\nThis DD was created by Penny Queen with help from the PennyQueen Discord DD team.\n\n**TL:DR** I believe Newlox will be worth $10.12 to $15.80 in five years, much more if their OAR technology can be licensed. They pull out the 60% of gold that artisanal miners leave behind and remove contaminants at the same time. Their costs are low, they are well funded, agile and there is no shortage of supply for them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2moa46hfyt971.jpg?width=474&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83af3b8d3dba0d83f17b8c7663658d7aa00070b9\n\nFor purposes of this article all pricing will be in **USD**. Gold is currently trading at $1,810(07.06.2021) per ounce and one troy ounce of gold is 31.1 grams.\n\n# Company Overview -\n\nNewlox Gold is an environmental remediation company that recovers gold from inefficient artisanal mining tailings. They currently have a market cap of 25.19 million US and a share price of $0.331USD . They have two operating projects in Costa Rica and have recently announced a third and fourth project that will be located in Brazil. They produce precious metal concentrates through the flotation and gravity processes using a customized intensive carbon in leach (CIL) system designed in partnership with the Company\u2019s advisors at the Norman B Keevil Institute of Mining Engineering at the University of British Columbia.\n\nNewlox Gold is different from other gold miners in that their process provides environmental remediation by removing toxic mercury from the tailings and that they do not carry the expensive burden of gold discovery.\n\nMost gold exploration companies spend many years and millions of dollars attempting to locate gold rich ground. Newlox goes to proven gold reserves and processes the remaining soil. Artisanal mining practices are at best 40% efficient in removing gold. The Newlox process is over 90% efficient in recovering gold. Costa Rica is said to have a 200 year backlog of tailings in need of remediation.\n\n**Project 1: Oro Roca**, **Costa Rica**: This facility is currently producing gold and at full scale, by the end of summer, will process 80 tons a day of tailings with 9 grams of gold per ton. Their 90% recovery rate equals 648 grams per day or 21 ounces of gold, roughly 6500 ounces per year at a cost of $600 per ounce. At a gold price of 1810/oz this one project equals a gross margin of **7.86 million**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7uzuhzziyt971.jpg?width=1213&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88837f807a9d8e7815ce9e4f86c9a88be33a49ff\n\n**Project 2: Boston facility, Costa Rica**: This project is currently operated with a partner mining model, where local miners are given a 50/50 split on net profits. This allows miners to remove the soil and bring it directly to Newlox for processing. The local miners are able to avoid the labor-intensive gold recovery process and increase their mining capacity. Since traditional artisan mining can only recover up to 40% of the gold, the miners are effectively receiving the net profit of 45% of the total gold without the labor of the recovery process. Newlox prevents the soil from ever being contaminated with mercury.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that these are fully permitted projects in Costa Rica, a politically stable democratic country, with grid supplied energy that is 96% renewable. The project sites have roads maintained by the municipalities and storage for additional feedstocks to hedge against unfavorable weather.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k03luo1lyt971.jpg?width=1050&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db654b917a71e4203998e7caaac8cc457a2f7dfb\n\nThe Costa Rican government has approached Newlox with interest, which is an important distinction. Newlox provides free contaminant remediation, therefore governments will seek to partner with Newlox which will result in a streamlined permitting process (other governments have already approached them). Newlox\u2019s presence is a boon for the environment, the local economies and for the miners as well. Newlox\u2019s process leaves the environment cleaner and the processed tailings can be used for roadways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9mk5d1myt971.jpg?width=1216&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09506d9facce162cd5f338e84de1b71658ac97f6\n\nThis project has a larger scope and higher gold content than Oro Roca. They will process 150 tons a day at about 15 grams per ton. Their 90% capture rate gives them 2025 grams a day, or roughly 65 ounces. This plant will generate over 20,000 ounces of gold annually and after a 50:50 profit split should bring in **18 million** dollars a year (I expect that there are additional costs to be added here for the processing and taxes).\n\nNewlox has just announced two new facilities in Brazil establishing them as an international gold producer. We do not have exact specifications on the new mine, but it is planned for a greater tonnage than the others. Brazil has over 250,000 artisanal miners just in the province of Amazonia.\n\nThe company has clearly laid out plans to open two facilities a year over the next five years putting their annual gold production at 145,000 ounces. At today\u2019s gold price **this equals over 262 million dollars in annual revenue**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/et045uhoyt971.jpg?width=1888&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b7f11f9535c25b91cc2cd2826b9130b3a50586b\n\nThe Capex for their processing plants is only 2 million and they have proven to be an agile company that is making Earth and community conscious decisions. They are currently well funded through 2021. I would not be surprised to see them exceed their current goal of 10 facilities in five years.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\nRevenue being reported at the end of July - I believe they will cross the magic profitability line\n\nUS OTC ticker to gain DTC compliance\n\nFull scale operations coming to both Costa Rican facilities\n\nAddition of two Brazillian facilities\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n\u00b7 Gold producer with projects reaching 900% annual return on capital expense.\n\n\u00b7 Huge self-funded 5-year growth plan\n\n\u00b7 Currently incorrectly classified as a gold exploration company \u2013 this is a massively underpriced gold producer.\n\n\u00b7 Creating more clean and efficient technologies for potential licensing\n\n\u00b7 Plan for annual dividends\n\n\u00b7 **PennyQueen** **5 year price range $10.12 to $15.80 USD**\n\n(roughly 67-101x the price when this was released to the PennyQueen Discord 06.17.2021)\n\nInvesting thesisNewlox is currently being viewed as a junior miner and as such has a PE of 3. After production numbers begin to come in (July 2021) they should be recognized as a producer and should have a PE of 20-30, depending on gold prices.5-year Share Price Projections\n\nTheir five-year plan puts them at 262 million dollars in revenue in today\u2019s dollars. Since it is unknown whether they will be purchasing their feedstock ($600 cost per ounce) or utilizing the 50:50 profit split of the partner mining model, I will use the more conservative numbers. 262m in revenue equates to roughly 131m dollars profit. There are many tax breaks and credits available for environmental remediation and complicated tax treaties in place, so I will be assuming the standard BC and Canadian 27% corporate taxes. This brings us to 95.6m net profit. These numbers do not include potential licensing of their unique environmentally friendly aqua regia process or the value of silver which will also be reclaimed from their operations.\n\nWith 189,004,078 shares fully diluted this gives us a diluted EPS of 50.6 cents. A PE range of 20-30, gives us a price range of $10.12-$15.18 (This is 30-45 times what it is currently trading at). This is my price target range.\n\nAccording to Morningstar, the typical Canadian-listed gold company trades at a 28.8x price-earnings multiple. Using these same numbers we get a share price of **$14.57.** ***This means that an annual dividend yield of 2.28% would repay today\u2019s price entire share price*** ***every year******.*** Newlox plans to pay dividends, but the timeframe and amount have not been disclosed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/la8c4b5qyt971.jpg?width=775&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eb07a8dc3e81a056892057dbf4fb391c13c426c\n\n# [Newlox Research &amp; Development Tech](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f319f4859ab8a5393735b49/t/5fa2ef1da2e3ca40dddd52f4/1604513574695/Newlox+R%26D+Presentation+%28Fall+2020%29.pdf)\n\n\\- [Newlox R&amp;D](https://www.newlox.tech/) is their wholly owned subsidiary which is working with the University of British Columbia in Canada and Chiba University in Japan to create their DMSO technology, an organic aqua regia (OAR) gold leaching technique for potential licensing to the global 180 billion dollar global mining industry.\n\nOAR uses an organic reagent which is non-toxic and allows for a water-free, and effluent-free leaching process for recovering gold and other precious metals. A recent testing at the University of Chiba achieved **100% gold recovery** in 4 hours at 80 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe opportunity this technology could provide is massive, but also speculative and difficult to quantify. They are currently pursuing joint ventures, partnerships and licensing agreements that would ramp up their expansion around the world and could earn them healthy royalties adding an almost unlimited royalty stream.\n\n# \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n11rwnvuyt971.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49d2ec54091e637fd456a27f263081428d55b87e\n\n# ESG highlights\n\n* Provides free environmental remediation\n* Mercury negative process.\n* Improving economic and health conditions for artisanal miners.\n* Creating new clean technologies to be made available for free to the mining industry.\n* Their wholly owned R&amp;D subsidiary is creating technologies which will target the e-waste recycling market.\n\n# Industry Facts\n\nGold is a 180 billion dollar annual industry.\n\nSmall scale and artisanal mining practices account for 20% of that production, 36 billion dollars.\n\nAccording to the [US Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-gold.pdf), there are around 53,000 tons of [global gold reserves](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/largest-gold-reserves/), with an estimated 3,200 tons mined worldwide in 2020 \u2013 a roughly 5% annual decline in output caused by the disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nCanadian miners listed on the TSX and TSX Venture account for 25% of global production.\n\n# Total Addressable Market\n\nThe TAM for Newlox Gold is 36 billion dollars. Clearly, I do not think that Newlox will grow so large that it would capture this entire industry, but it is important to note both the room for expansion and the diminished risk of competition in this space.\n\n# Competitors \u2013\n\n[BacTech](https://www.bactechgreen.com/) \\- USOTC:BCCEF - Bactech utilizes a bacterial process called bioleaching to free precious metals from tailings and ore. Their process also provides ecological benefit, by removing arsenic and has been 99.4-100% effective at removing gold in lab tests. They are planning a 50 ton per day facility in Ecuador, expected to begin in Q1 of 2022. They are projecting 26,000 ounces annually from this facility. The downside to their project is that it requires a robust facility with a capex of 10m, roughly 4x that of the Boston project per ounce. They claim that their system is modular and some of their costs are unknown. This company is my favorite competitor but it has not been proven at scale. I do believe that they will be successful, but due to the size of the total addressable market I believe there is room for several similar companies. BacTech has a market cap of 7.8m, a share price of $.0559 cents, 158 million shares fully diluted and a **PE ratio of 13.98.**\n\n[Dynacor](https://dynacor.com/presentation/) \\- USOTC:DNGDF - Dynacor expects to process 375 tons per day in 2021. Dynacor sells some \u201cCertified Clean Gold\u201d at a premium for its ESG sourcing. Their plant has a 16m capex to process 300 tons per day, essentially 4 times Newlox\u2019s cost. They have a market cap of 80m, 39m shares at price of $2.05 and a forward annual dividend rate of 3.18%. They have a **PE ratio of 20.55**. Dynacor in my view proves that Newlox should have a PE ratio of at least 20 and that they can pay dividends.\n\n[Enviroleach ](https://www.enviroleach.com/investors)\\- USOTC: EVLLF - Enviroleach, soon to be renamed EnviroMetal, removes gold from tailings, electronic waste (E-waste) and catalytic converters. *Because their in situ mining is still in testing uses fracking based technology and recycling is their focus, I do not consider them a true competitor.* Due to their diverse applications, they have a 360b total addressable market . They are currently operating a 2,400 ton per year facility in Vancouver BC and planning four 6000 ton per year facilities in North America. Their facilities have a capex of 10m, with a 24m revenue potential at each facility. Enviroleach has a market cap of 33.8m, 93.6m outstanding shares and a stock price of 36 cents.\n\n# Risks\n\n**Gold Prices -** The price of gold will remain a large financial factor for Newlox Gold. Gold is currently priced at $1792 but has reached as high as $2,032.16 USD per troy ounce(08.07.2020).\n\n**Covid** \u2013 In June of 2020, operations at Plant 1 were shut down due to a nearby outbreak of Covid. Production resumed on November 13th of that same year.\n\nWhen operations first shut down, Costa Rica (where Plant 1 is located) was seeing about 11 new cases per million people per day. When operations resumed (on November 13th), there were 182 new cases per day. Since then, daily new cases per capita peaked at about 484 new cases per million (on May 15th of this year), and have since declined to fewer than 300. There's no indication that operations have shutdown since resuming last November. The reason for this is that Company management disassembled, moved, then re-assembled Plant 1 to a location adjacent to the Boston Project. Given that production remained steady throughout the second wave that started in April, it's not unreasonable to assume that they will continue through any Delta-induced third wave that may arise.\n\n# Benefits\n\nNewlox Research and Development Corporation Organic Aqua Regia licensing, creating water-free non-toxic methods with 90% gold recovery. This process prevents the need for water or management of effluent in mining. **This revolutionary technology could be licensed globally to major and small-scale mining operations and potentially generate more revenue for the company than their entire gold reclamation program.**\n\nOn-site assays - Newlox has their own onsite lab to check new feedstock samples to ensure high enough gold content. Most companies need to send out their samples and wait about two weeks for results.\n\nSocial aspects - Newlox has proven their commitment to bettering the lives of their partner miners and the global environment.\n\nPotential to sell gold at higher prices as \u201cCertified Clean Gold\u201d.\n\nExecutive Team -Newlox Gold\n\nNewlox has an extremely competent management team and I cannot overstate how much of an advantage they have with the addition of Dr. Marcello Viega to the R&amp;D company, I consider him the Chief Alchemist.\n\nLink **-** [Complete Newlox Executive Team](https://newloxgold.com/about/#managementComplete%20Newlox%20Executive%20Team)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4azptlf0zt971.jpg?width=1825&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dac8d9925230c3c96f3e9f10548faf870432a34a\n\n**Executive Team - Newlox R&amp;D**\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn7bv5s1zt971.jpg?width=1816&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d75c2f291b61ff31cb825593d7867e0ee00c2dd\n\n**Current Financials**\n\nThis is a speculative play and the current financial status is not relevant to my price predictions but I will include them as no DD is complete without this information. You can expect current financials to be out in July.\n\nInside ownership is at 23.54%, I see this as a good sign that they believe in the company.\n\nPercent held by institutions is at 0%, this is typically not a great indicator but it is high up on the Penny Queen checklist. To me, the goal is to find an undervalued company before the so-called \u2018smart money\u2019 does. I prefer institutional ownership to start after my purchase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yox6bx65zt971.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2ff31b4e256b238e316e368042c927317ab0925\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q34tnv65zt971.jpg?width=1456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f4122849582b7d15ddb47a539403013871bdeb5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4btrwv65zt971.jpg?width=1464&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8329f3936802da2508f0199f835362b8da282356\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtjce075zt971.jpg?width=1474&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f31c5e960aad656988cf15d3290056f643a258c\n\n**Warning to traders:** This is still not financial advice. Newlox Gold currently has a float of only 102 million shares. This is in stock terms, a very small float, increased interest in a company of this size can send the stock price high very quickly. Almost every time a stock hits an all time high the price retraces lower. I caution you to mind your entry price and not to pay more than you believe it is worth. The saying goes that if you like a stock at $1, you should like it more at 50 cents, but many traders are unhappy when they buy in at a price higher than the stock settles at. If you buy this to hold it, then hold it, but realize that other people will attempt to take profit. Never invest money that you need to survive, there is risk and opportunity in every company.\n\n**Buying the stock in the US** is slightly more complicated. There is a US OTC ticker NWLXF, but the company did not apply for this, it was done by a market maker. They are currently going through the process of DTC clearance which should be done by the end of the month.\n\nIn the meantime if you use Fidelity, TD or Schwab you can buy under the NWLXF ticker.\n\nYou can also use the LUX/CN ticker on TD Ameritrade's Think or Swim Platform or calling with the foreign trade desk.\n\nYou can also use the LUX:CA symbol on Fidelity\u2019s system if you enable international trades. If you choose to purchase this, I recommend just calling the international trade desk and having them place the trade for you, these trades fill much faster in my experience.\n\n**Links :**\n\n[Newlox Establishes Brazilian ESG Gold Initiative - Mining Stock Education](https://www.miningstockeducation.com/2021/06/newlox-establishes-brazilian-esg-gold-initiative/)\n\n[Newlox Research &amp; Development Corp.](https://www.newlox.tech/)\n\n[Marcello+Veiga+Resume+(2021).pdf (squarespace.com)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f319f4859ab8a5393735b49/t/603498e4154cce3e97200569/1614059749591/Marcello+Veiga+Resume+%282021%29.pdf)\n\n[Home - Artisanal Gold Council](https://www.artisanalgold.org/)\n\n[Regulatory Filing March 2021](https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&amp;docClass=5&amp;issuerNo=00032095&amp;issuerType=03&amp;projectNo=03181424&amp;docId=4899562)\n\n[Costa Rica Payments for Environmental Cleanup](https://www.cbd.int/financial/pes/costarica-pestechnical.pdf)\n\nThis is a a [Complete listing of the Penny Queen Traded Stocks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/123kzHvnIwYdS_0Nu1DfD4TxYmRleZpJTbHmzD18qw6g/edit?ts=60cb76ac#gid=0) with the dates they were added and all currents gains.\n\nIf you think I missed something or misrepresent anything please send me a message here or on Discord",

        "selftext": "I've just recently opened up a Roth and deposited my stimulus checks so I have approximately $2,500 in the Roth. I also have invested approximately 60% in the fidelity 500 ETF index, 20% in mid-cap and 20% in small cap value. They're all index funds from Fidelity with a Fidelity Roth. My question is is it better to have this throughout retirement and even in retirement just keep it going or just have a single fund ticker symbol  SCHD dividend ETF and just build the dividends up to retirement and then hold inside of retirement and just live off of the dividends. I kind of felt this was the better way to go simply because if I can get $30k to $40k of dividend payout a year in addition to my other retirement from Nationwide through the state and my PERF pension and then not to mention social security if I still get it, I can at least pass on the principal of the Roth to my kids.\n\n Both investment strategies sound very valuable but I would just feel bad selling shares of my previous portfolio strategy as opposed to just living off of the dividends with the $SCHD strategy and then giving the principal of God willing $700,000 plus in the Roth to the kids. \n\n\nAlso I was thinking about the benefits of just staying in the S&amp;p 500 or just staying in the SCHD index simply because I also have a nationwide and a PERF account that are taxable and I'll probably transition those into Target date funds closer to retirement and live off of that and the pension till max social security kicks in. Does this look like a sound way to do it. I know I need a financial advisor but I'm not spending money when I'm just now starting to grow it. I'm more or less I'm looking to see what my peers are doing in my situation. By the way, baby mama is useless and I'm single and I date and play around but I'm not counting on a spouse since I've been burned so bad I lost faith in marriage. So all this I plan to do on my own.",

        "selftext": "In February 2021 I tried to get my Roth IRA and IRA transferred over from New York life to Vanguard. Sometime in March, I had called vanguard and asked for an update. The guy told me that \u201cno news is good news.\u201d So, I waited. In May, I reached out to NYL and asked what was going on on their side. They looked into and said that Vanguard filled out the paperwork incorrectly. I reached back out to Vanguard and they supposedly corrected the issues and we were on our way to getting the accounts transferred. So, I waited. Well, I just checked and see that the Roth has been transferred to vanguard as of June but the IRA is still with NYL and they said that they have no transfer request paperwork from Vanguard for it. I spent 2.5 hours yesterday on hold with Vanguard trying to talk to someone. Finally, I am able to talk to someone (in the wrong department) who told me that they were super busy since they were closed on Monday for the holiday and to call back on Friday because wait times shouldn\u2019t be as bad then. I tried calling the number he gave me, this morning but again was on hold for 20 minutes and had to hang up. \nMy question is: do I continue to put up with this BS from Vanguard and get the IRA transferred over? Should I move the IRA to Fidelity and leave the Roth with Vanguard? Should I move everything to Vanguard? \nI am super annoyed about the situation because it shouldn\u2019t take 5 months to do this.

        "selftext": "&gt; Note that I have published this article elsewhere on the internet and am happy to confirm with mods if needed. My single link post was previously removed\n\nSummary\n-------\n\n-   In 2018, the U.S. Army announced its intention to build next generation training &amp; simulation capabilities via the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS).\n-   In November 2018, Microsoft was awarded a two year prototyping contract worth $480 million for augmented reality headsets to be used as part of IVAS.\n-   On March 31, 2021, the Army awarded Microsoft a 10 year contract worth up to $21B to productionalize IVAS.\n-   Since the same time as the IVAS announcement, VirTra management has been signaling that it too is working toward a large military contract win, in its case, involving VirTra's patented recoil kits and possibly Threat-Fire devices.\n-   While no contract has been publicly announced, my research leads me to believe VirTra will be supplying its industry leading recoil kits to the Army with a minimum expectation of $20M in revenue through FY23 and potential recurring and growing demand over the subsequent 8 years of the IVAS contract.\n\nCompany Description\n-------------------\n\nVirTra's Mission is to save lives by developing, manufacturing and supporting the most powerful and immersive training simulators, scenarios and accessories such as their patented recoil kits and Threat-Fire devices. Their largest business has historically been simulator sales to Law Enforcement, but since late 2018 with the Army's announcement of building next generation simulation and training capabilities via the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), VirTra has been attempting to expand its sales presence and footprint in the military market.\n\nVirTra's Product Line\n---------------------\n\nBelow is an overview of VirTra's core products. Note that quotes in this section come directly from [www.virtra.com](http://www.virtra.com)\n\n#### High Fidelity Training Simulators\n\nVirTra's main product is its \"use of force and decision-making training simulators designed to teach, test and sustain officers' knowledge and skills. These simulators are equipped with extensive branching options, where each scenario unfolds depending on the instructor or trainee's actions. VirTra's complete scenario library offers a wide variety of situations that run from weapons manipulation drills and marksmanship to use of force, de-escalation and active shooter response allowing officers to train effectively and efficiently.\"\n\n#### Recoil Kits (*patented)\n\nVirTra's in-house manufactured \"simulated firearm recoil kits are designed to convert a live firearm into a simulation-ready weapon without permanent modification. The drop-in laser recoil kit is installed in the trainee's duty weapon without permanent modification, while the CO2 magazine supplies realistic recoil.\" Patents acquired in Feb 2019 make VirTra \"the only company who can provide both running out of ammunition and weapon jamming capabilities that do not require batteries or electronics.\" These enhancements make weapons with VirTra's recoil kits installed the most realistic simulation-ready weapons on the market.\n\n#### Threat-Fire devices (*patented)\n\nThreat-Fire devices are an in-house manufactured accessory that \"greatly enhances training by bringing real-life consequences into the simulation. This product delivers an electric impulse that simulates consequence actions, including: gunfire, explosions and dog attacks.\" Importantly, \"VirTra holds the only patent for electrical stimulation within a simulation\" and has successfully defended this patent against competition who tried to implement similar functionality.\n\n#### Certified Curriculum (V-VICTA)\n\n\"V-VICTA---Virtual Interactive Coursework Training Academy---delivers the only nationally certified simulation curriculum for law enforcement training. The curriculum is developed exclusively with nationally recognized partnerships and is designed to teach, train, test and sustain both inside and out of the police training simulation.\"\n\n#### Custom Software (V-AUTHOR)\n\n\"The V-Author programs revolutionize training by placing training in the hands of the instructors who know their specific needs and locations. These programs allow instructors to create and edit scenarios customized to their agency's training objectives, thus providing more freedom and less limitation in training.\"\n\nVirTra's Upcoming Growth Opportunities (Military &amp; Law Enforcement)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Background: The Army's IVAS program with state of the art training capabilities\n\nThe Army's IVAS program is, among other things, building a cutting edge training solution that uses Microsoft's Hololens technology as Augmented Reality/Mixed Reality headsets to \"enable tactical planning, networked information sharing, and an augmented reality Synthetic Training Environment that will enable Warfighters to fight 25 'bloodless battles' before engaging the enemy\" ([IVAS Mission Statement](https://www.peosoldier.army.mil/Equipment/Equipment-Portfolio/Project-Manager-Integrated-Visual-Augmentation-System/)) The two main components as it relates to VirTra are the Heads Up Display (HUD), essentially an AR/VR headset which likens to VirTra's simulator screens, and the Synthetic Training Environment (STE) which likens to the software component that VirTra integrates their hardware into.\n\n### The Army's launch of the IVAS program as it relates to VirTra\n\nIn August 2018, the government issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) for the IVAS program. In VirTra's subsequent conference call, CEO Bob Ferris made it clear that this is the opportunity VirTra had been waiting for. CEO Ferris [stated](https://seek ingalpha.com/article/4221929-virtras-vtsi-ceo-bob-ferris-on-q3-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) \"we're also involved with changes occurring in the military simulation market. Recently, the U.S. army and the U.S. marines announced their acute focus on futuristic simulation training [read: IVAS]. VirTra products are very much in line with potential military requirements. In some cases, we will need to modify our current products in order to work on new advanced technology platforms, such AR or Augmented Reality or Mixed Reality. But these modifications are easily made given the way we design our products originally. We actually anticipated growing demand in the space and the need for flexible products. So we precisely built our technology to be modular. We are extremely excited by this news and we think VirTra offers products that are industry leading, well tested and simply a perfect fit for portions of the growing military appetite for effective simulation training.\"\n\nFollowing that, In January 2019, VirTra issued a [statement](https://www.virtra.com/virtra-reviews-2018-operational-progress-and-sets-2019-strategic-priorities/) that it is their \"intention to strengthen and diversify our current business by bolstering our technological capabilities and increasing our sales footprint and resources in the military market.\" This announcement came only a month after the army's announcement that Microsoft had won a $480M contract to build prototypes for the new IVAS program. Importantly, from that point forward, VirTra conference calls and investor presentations have continually given general updates on the ever present military opportunity. If not aware of the Army program, this opportunity never seemed to materialize for VirTra and instead seemed like a never end carrot on a stick. However, with the first units of IVAS headsets set to be delivered in September 2021, things are becoming more clear. it is my interpretation that VirTra is on the precipice of announcing a major contract for the IVAS program to provide thousands of recoil kits and potentially Threat-Fire devices and/or ballistic calculation software which could be worth north of $10,000,000+ per year for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe following sections are some of the reasons why I think VirTra is on the verge of announcing a deal as part of the IVAS program:\n\n### Military's Requirement for Recoil Kits and Ballistic Accuracy\n\nThe Army made it clear since the beginning of the program via it's [Statement of Objectives](https://mk0uploadvrcom4bcwhj.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Army-AR-Objectives.pdf) that they want recoil kits which integrate directly into real weapons. VirTra is the clear leader in this space. By using real weapons with simulation recoil kits, the Army is trying to solve the [following problems](https://web.archive.org/web/20210625015453/https://nstxl.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/STE-LTS-Industry-Day-Slides-11-FEB-21-FINAL_w-NSTXL.pdf) (which I've followed with my commentary of how VirTra's solutions solve this problem):\n\n-   \"*Non-combat appended equipment Interferes with combat equipment and competes with weapon platform real estate limitations*\" -- VirTra's recoil kits don't require any additional equipment whereas most other tetherless recoil kits on the market require extra equipment.\n\n-   \"*Hit location not used in casualty assessment\"* - VirTra has an industry leading ballistics calculator and already has After Action Review capabilities in their simulator to accurately measure where the simulation round hit. From the VirTra [website](https://www.virtra.com/simulator/law-enforcement-v-st-pro/), their \"[V-Marksmanship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOSxNSwIlfc) technology is equipped with the most accurate ballistic calculator in the industry. This ballistic calculator mimics the real-world trajectory of a projectile based on the weapon specifications---sight height, barrel twist rate, barrel length, etc.---the projectile type and grain and the selected weather conditions. Furthermore, it has been independently verified and tested for accuracy up to 2,500 meters within .02 milliradians---thus providing a powerful training that other marksmanship training simulator programs cannot provide.\"\n\n-   *\"Unrealistic lethality ranges\"* - VirTra's ballistic calculators are built for and unique to each weapon's ballistic specs therefore staying true to the weapon in use.\n\n-   *\"Cannot lead moving targets\"* -- VirTra's simulators have moving targets with which their users and weapons can interact.\n\n#### VirTra bolstered their portfolio of patented products\n\nKnowing the above requirements, in February 2019 VirTra was able to expand their recoil kit's capabilities which even better align with the requirements of the Army. VirTra acquired patents from Tiberius Technology to officially cement their niche [to be](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2019/10/31/1938658/34563/en/VirTra-Awarded-Patents-for-TASER-Training-and-Simulating-Firearms-and-Malfunctions.html) \"the only company in the United States that can produce or sell a specially designed kit that affordably converts a live firearm into a safe and reliable training tool that can simulate mechanical malfunction and therefore increase realism.\" About the Tiberius [acquisition](https://seek ingalpha.com/article/4251656-virtras-vtsi-ceo-bob-ferris-on-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link), \"future military needs require drop in recoil kits for simulated weapons. Our recent strategic purchase of Tiberius patent portfolio ... combined with existing drop in recoil kit technology could perfectly match some of these needs.\"Additionally, in the [Statement of Objectives](https://mk0uploadvrcom4bcwhj.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Army-AR-Objectives.pdf) for IVAS, STP #1 required \"Research M&amp;S (Modeling &amp; Simulation) capabilities, Identify/prioritize M&amp;S gaps\" as well as to \"begin collecting existing Soldier performance studies/research data, execute evaluations, studies, and data collection to close gaps.\" STP#1 was set to take place in March. I can't say for certain the following study took place specifically because of the IVAS requirements, but the following month in April 2019, Army Research Lab's ran a clinical study using Threat-Fire devices and a V-300 simulator. This study scientifically validated the efficacy of Threat-Fire use in training such that its use definitively leads to better real world performance. Again, from the [press release](https://www.virtra.com/new-clinical-study-features-virtra-v-300-for-stress-induced-training/): \"the [simulation] system paired with the VirTra's patented Threat-Fire [device] induced the right amount of stress to impact their performance. By impacting their performance in a significant way, they are better able to perform properly in real-world situations.\"\n\n#### VirTra has been making connections within the US Army and the Training &amp; Simulation market\n\nThe initial IVAS award was handed out in November 2018. VirTra's [press release](https://www.virtra.com/virtra-engages-top-military-simulation-consultant/) in July 2019 reported \"In [January 2019](https://www.virtra.com/investor-relations/virtra-reviews-2018-operational-progress-and-sets-2019-strategic-priorities), VirTra announced a concerted effort to allocate more of the company's attention and resources towards the military market. As part of that strategy, the company has hired Colonel Joe O'Connell, USAR (Ret.), CEO of JL O'Connell &amp; Associates, to assist in advising and brokering relationships with current military leaders and decision makers. JL O'Connell &amp; Associates provides a full spectrum of business development services, including early teaming and capturing as well as proposal and program management solutions.\" A year later, VirTra hired John Givens to the Board of Directors [noting](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001085243/000149315220020359/ex99-2.htm) that he has \"a unique track record of successfully selling and implementing large military simulation contracts worldwide.\" John \"established the US company of BISim, and during his tenure as president of the company, he led the business development of its military simulation products from inception to becoming one of the most widely used simulation products throughout all branches of the U.S. military\"\n\nBoth of the above hires seem to have occurred specifically to make connections within the Army and military as a whole and the public statements provided made it clear that the intent was to bolster VirTra's military roster to enhance the company's chances of winning contracts with the Military.\n\n#### H1 2021 consisted of hiring, hiring, and more hiring, plus setup of a new ERP system, and raising $18M\n\nCEO Ferris has stated numerous times that the company is conservative with their capital structure. However in the first five months of 2021, VirTra took unprecedented action to bolster their capability for growth at the expense of spending. In that time, the following actions were taken which in my opinion signals a high likelihood that something big and imminent is on the horizon:\n\n-   **17% headcount growth with an additional 14 new jobs currently posted in Q2**: At the end of 2019, VirTra had 88 employees. At the end of 2020, it was 92. By May 2021, VirTra already had 103 employees. If a 17% increase in headcount wasn't fast enough growth, as of a few days ago in mid-June, VirTra had an additional 14 new job postings. 6 were specifically related to manufacturing or supply chain including CNC Machinist, Inventory Controller, Supply Chain Project Manager, and Manufacturing Engineer. As VirTra's in house manufacturing facility produces recoil kits and Threat-Fire devices, this is a clear indication that demand is increasing for these products.\n\n-   **Onboarded a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system**: A new ERP system requires an overhaul of a lot of existing processes requiring both significant time investment and money. A company typically only takes this extreme measure when it fully expects significant growth in its future. And [from](https://seek ingalpha.com/article/4429473-virtras-vtsi-ceo-bob-ferris-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) CEO Ferris, this \"demonstrates that we are preparing our company to scale to an ever-larger size and doing so demands a major overhaul of our logistical systems.\"\n\n-   **Capital Raise**: On March 30th, VirTra's stock traded 165,956,500 shares. For context, the previous thirty days of trading averaged 60,000 shares traded. (Interestingly enough for conspiracy theorists -- but not my point -- is the following day, on March 31st, the Army announced their $21.9B award to Microsoft to build production IVAS units). With all of this volume, VirTra jumped at the opportunity to raise $18M by doing a direct offering of 3M shares (now 10.78M shares outstanding) of common stock at $6/share. VirTra has historically been conservative with their balance sheet since paying down all debt when CEO Ferris took over the company and has not raised raised money nor taken on additional debt besides ~$1M in PPP loans since. In my mind, this raise signals significant strength for the company; they believe this short term share count dilution is well worth the long term growth opportunities it may open up.\n\n#### Material backlog amounts from the military in Q1 2021\n\nLastly, once the Army signed a deal with Microsoft and it was official that they were moving forward with IVAS production work, CEO Ferris hinted to what sounds like the mythical large military opportunity is officially in the pipeline. I'll let CEO Ferris's comments from the [most recent conference](https://seek ingalpha.com/article/4429473-virtras-vtsi-ceo-bob-ferris-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) call wrap this up, \"Demand for our solutions is reaching a fever pitch and our ability to fulfill that demand and continue to grow has never been more critical.\" \"Today, much of this transitional work is now behind us, which means our attention is now focused on growth.\n\nDuring our last call, I discussed some of the details of our sales strategy as it pertains to the military market. As a reminder, we often find success by leveraging our industry-leading patented products, by partnering with larger players who are already ingrained with decision-makers. Due to the competitiveness of our industry and the sense of nature of many of our client relationships, we are often prohibited from disclosing details related to current contracts, as well as prospective growth areas.\n\nWe understand that the lack of large numbers of press releases can be frustrating for some investors who are eager to learn more details about where VirTra is growing and how. However, our mentality at VirTra is to put the business and the customer first, especially when releasing too much information too early can endanger material opportunities. We also believe actions speak louder than words.\n\nWe say as much as we can when we can, but there are instances in which we are prohibited from disclosing details. Unfortunately, this is one of those instances. But I can confirm that we've made very real progress in the military market. In fact, the fruits of that labor have started to show up in our backlog in a material way. As long as the need for quality training exists, and as long as we're able to execute on our strategy, we believe that our success could well continue. It might even accelerate.\"\n\n#### What's next for IVAS?\n\nIVAS is set to field it's first units by September of 2021. Over the next two years, Microsoft is supposed to continue to iterate and deliver up to 120,000 HUD units to the Army. This only pertains to opportunities that are already public. Through 2024, the military will continue to issue prototype and production contracts building out the STE more completely. This consists of additional work for the Squad immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT), STE-Live, and Soldier Virtual Trainer (SVT). All of these programs will build on what the HUD already provides which will significantly upgrade the Army's training programs. I believe VirTra's products will be a core component of all of these programs.\n\n#### IVAS Contract Potential\n\nWhile specific details about potential contracts are unknown, we can come up with a good idea of an upper and lower bound for recoil kits as a baseline. As a lower bound, the CEO has [stated](https://seek ingalpha.com/article/4251656-virtras-vtsi-ceo-bob-ferris-on-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) \"what we've heard is the military is looking at buying thousands and thousands of recoil kits.\" I'll use 10,000 as a rough estimate. As an upper bound, we can use the same ratio of recoil kits per IVAS unit delivered during STPs and prorating that to the 120k HUDunits to be delivered through 2023. During STP4, there were 540 recoil kits required and 1600 HUD's delivered or ~33% of total HUD units. This would mean there is a need for ~40,000 recoil kits. Using $3100 per recoil kit (the current cost of VirTra's lowest priced recoil kit) as a rough estimate, revenues would be in the rtange of $31M and $124M. CEO Ferris [guided](https://seek ingalpha.com/article/4367903-virtra-inc-vtsi-ceo-bob-ferris-on-q2-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) that \"we do tend, overall, to be around 60% gross margins ... if you look back through our quarters in history. ... And there are chances that, based on other factors, we could go after a large contract with lower margins.\" So using 40% gross margins and annualizing the above, that would translate into roughly $0.57-$2.34 of additional EPS each of the following two years alone with add on orders likely in the future! For context, current estimates have VirTra earning $0.25 EPS in 2021.\n\n### Other Growth Opportunities\n\nBut that's not all! Below are a few more near term growth opportunities which could also increase growth rates for VirTra. While not as significant as the military deal, these are non-trivial opportunities which in their own rights could bring significant growth to the company from its current expected growth rate of low double digits.\n\n#### STEP Program\n\nIn early 2019, VirTra rolled out a subscription service which lowered upfront costs for their simulators from $100-300k down to as little as $900/month. In the two plus years of the STEP program, it has a 100% retention rate and expands Total Addressable Market (TAgcM) from roughly \u2153 of the largest 18,000 U.S. law enforcement agencies to all 18,000 agencies. As more time goes on, more agencies will have the opportunity to purchase the cheaper up front option which has the added benefit of making VirTra's revenue stream much more predictable.\n\n#### COVID related lockdowns are ending\n\nVirTra has not been able to deliver equipment as quickly as pre-COVID due to lockdowns and travel restrictions. Additionally, CEO Ferris has mentioned that sales have not slowed down and their new and upgraded website, which was implemented pre-covid, was a serendipitously timed expansion of their sales infrastructure. This helped grow their bookings from $4.2M in Q4 2019 to $7.4M in Q1 2021. Since all of those bookings have not yet been delivered, reopenings will allow VirTra to deliver goods and turn their current $16.1M backlog into revenue much faster.\n\n#### Potential law enforcement de-escalation training mandates\n\nVirTra's V-VICTA is the only simulation company with de-escalation training curriculum that's been nationally certified by an independent third-party. With recent events, there is chatter of pushing for mandatory police training from either state or federal governments. For example, from CEO Ferris in the most [recent conference call](https://seek ingalpha.com/article/4429473-virtras-vtsi-ceo-bob-ferris-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link), \"Arizona mandated that before a person becomes a member of a civilian board that reviews the actions of peace officers in our state, that person must complete several requirements. And one of them is 20 hours of simulated event law enforcement training.\" Additionally, Georgia's [CJCC](https://www.justicegrants.info/GrantDetails.aspx?gid=59285) has allotted $15M for grants in 2021 to local law enforcement agencies \"to support scenario-based, hands-on training for law enforcement officers in use of force or de-escalation.\" Additional government funding or mandates across the country could lead to significant accelerated growth for the industry's leader in the law enforcement simulation training industry.\n\n#### A recent RFP for up to $24.5M with one of their largest customers, Customs and Border Protection\n\nIn mid May 2021, a sole source contract opportunity worth up to $24.5M over five years came through from Customs and Border Protection, a long standing customer of VirTra. While this was not an order for $24.5M nor was it a signed contract guaranteeing that amount of future revenue, it stands to reason that a customer who has historically been using VirTra, has reordered products, and now submits an opportunity hinting at large, long term orders is likely to follow through. To back up the fact that CBP is very interested in VirTra's product, a recent $800,000 order under a different $5M contract just came through on June 17.While a $24M IDIQ is nice to have, historically these IDIQ contracts are not always fully funded. VirTra has won a five year IDIQ worth up to $40M in 2016 that has only had roughly $15M of orders placed through it. And the above $5M IDIQ has had less than $2M of orders placed through it.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nVirTra currently has a market cap of $85M. The company is estimated to earn $0.25/share in EPS during 2021. With $20M in net cash, shares are trading just north of 20x earnings which could be argued as a fair price for a small company that has minimal year over year revenue growth. However, as mentioned, the core business has significant tailwinds supported by their recent growth in bookings and backlog which points to accelerating revenue in the quarters to come. More importantly, their opportunity for Military adoption has never been more compelling. As discussed above, the probability of Military success in the near term is high and would be a catalyst for significant increase in valuation if and when we do get confirmation. The size of contracts and awards could be transformational. By owning the stock at current prices, you have exposure to a core business that is growing and profitable with significant optionality on Military wins that could lead to their valuation doubling or more based on the magnitude of their success.",

        "selftext": "Posting here to offer a little perspective on what some apes saw as a quick hype play.\n\nIt was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tce80abpl871.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e78dde014d5edf387cd4f9f603fceb6ab6c4c7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes\\_value\\_creation\\_trajectory\\_is\\_very\\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/)\n\n(3) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(4) [https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(5) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9)  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10)   [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n\n(13)  [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(14) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(15) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(16) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)",

VTSAX / VTI - Total USA\n2. VFIAX / VOO - 500 Index (bigger risk, bigger companies, more volatility)\n3. VDADX / VIG - large, established companies that pay healthy dividends (tend to be older companies)\n4. VTWAX / VT - total world, but keep in mind that global growth can be uneven and overall gains dampened\n5. VEIRX - Equity / Income\n6. VGSLX / VNQ - Real Estate\n7. VFAIX / VFH - Financial\n\n**Fidelity**\n\n1. FSKAX - Total USA\n2. FZROX - Total USA / Zero Fee Fund (fewer small-cap stocks compared to FSKAX)\n3. FXAIX - 500 Index (bigger risk, bigger companies, more volatility)\n4. FEQIX - Equity / Income\n5. FSRNX - Real Estate\n6. FSPSX - International (large-cap excluding USA + Canada)\n\nDisclosure, I have positions in VTSAX, VEIRX, VGSLX, VFAIX and made my decisions based on I already had Vanguard at the time and didn't know about Fidelity's options--this is not financial advice!",

It seems that after a brief flare up of concerns regarding the coronavirus delta variant and a potential acceleration of the timeline to taper quantitative easing in the US, fears have greatly tempered. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 1.27% while the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.6% and is very slightly below it\u2019s all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, led the day, rising more than 2%.\n\nIn recent weeks, market participants are increasingly trying to gauge if the surge we are seeing in the more contagious coronavirus delta variant will weigh on global growth rates. Yesterday, it seems concerns came to a head after the Japanese government made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. The state of emergency will begin on Monday and run through Aug. 22, while the games are scheduled from July 23 to Aug. 8. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections, according to the CDC. According to reports, as of yesterday, only 16.8% of the Japanese population was vaccinated against the virus. \n\nIn other news, in another move that raised concerns about the global growth rate, China\u2019s central bank signalled it will be cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China\u2019s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy\u2019s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.\n\nKen Cheung, Chief Asian Foreign Exchange Strategist at Mizuho, said \u201cThe PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the Chinese economy. Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over China\u2019s growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming Q2 GDP figures in the coming week\u201d. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.\n\nWhile these global concerns did jitter the market yesterday, the impressive recovery in US equities underscores the remarkable strength of its economy, as the country continues reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, with 48% of the population fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In my opinion, while the delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, and the market may react negatively to headlines about it, the foundations of the recovery in the US (i.e nation-wide reopening measures, a rapidly improving labor market, record earnings from companies, and a high level of savings among Americans) are very strong and will continue to underpin a bull market here. \n\n**Highlights** \n\n* The recent sell-off in crude oil recovered, with the West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settling higher by 2.2% to $74.56 per barrel at the time of writing.\n* Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, reached a new all-time high today. \n* President Biden is expected to sign an executive agreement ordering the Federal Trade Commission to limit or ban noncompete agreements, unnecessary occupational licenses, and revise guidance for sharing wage information between the HR department and workers and other employers. \n* Tesla (TSLA), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said Friday they would work together on a new initiative to create the nation's most sustainable residential community. The companies said the provisionally named SunHouse at Easton Park in Austin, Texas, would be the first Tesla Solar neighborhood.\n* On Monday, a trial will kick off in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware between Elon Musk and shareholders. The plaintiffs alleged that Musk used his control at Tesla to force the company to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in order to protect his investment in the company from bankruptcy and want Musk to pay that money back to Tesla. IMO seems a little weird to me to sue about this given that SolarCity has proven to be a good acquisition for Tesla.\n* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly in early talks with the NFL to buy the rights to stream Sunday Night games for their streaming service. A while ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought the right to stream Thursday NFL games for Prime Video. \n* Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow, opened in theaters last night and is expected to be the biggest opening since 2019, with the film projected to bring around $80 million domestically. This is huge and a sign that Americans' appetite to go to movie-theaters is very real. Personally, I\u2019m going to go watch in the theaters this weekend. \n* Foxconn, a well known supplier for Apple, is discussing plans with Fisker (FSR) to open a factory to build EV\u2019s in Wisconsin. In a statement, the company said, \u201cFoxconn has engaged the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to discuss the company's plans for electric vehicle manufacturing. Foxconn is optimistic about our partnership with WEDC and looks forward to ongoing discussions\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Aptiv (APTV) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $170 to $182 at Buy.
