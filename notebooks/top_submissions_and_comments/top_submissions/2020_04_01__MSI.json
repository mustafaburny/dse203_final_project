        "selftext": "Saw more and more posts on this topic recently. It seems 5G is getting more and more attentions from the investors. \n\nHere let me ask you, what were the best winner stocks during the 3G transition, or 4G transition? As we knew that 3G or 4G were quite big jump at their times. I bet you cannot name a single winner stock who directly involved in 3G and 4G tech. I cannot, and I am quite tech savvy (an old software engineer from another country). However, we do know who benefit from the 3G and 4G technology.\n\nIMO, the biggest winner from 4G jump are: Apple, Netflix, Google.  Not ATT, Tmobile, Motorola,  Nokia. Companies like Apple benefited tremendously from the 4G technology. \n\nSo my point is that we need to focus more on the \"5G enabled\" (services that will thrive with 5G) instead of \"5G enabler\" (5G infrastructure like Nokia or Huawei or whatever lesser known company).\n\nThen what will be the \"5G enabled\"? Tbh i just don't know. My best bets are\n\n* Video games, especially mobile games. VR/AR maybe\n* social network service, old and new, FB\n* Different forms of video streaming: netflix, tiktok, twitch\n* e-commence and related: amazon, paypal, V, sq, etsy.\n\nSo you see, most of them are the \"golden oldies\": MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, GOOG, AMZN. I will just go for them.\n\n  \nTL;DR:  just go for QQQ or VGT for 5G hype.",
