        "selftext": "Mind you Walmart is at 400b market cap. So what this means is that Tesla would need to make as much profit as 3 Walmart corporations In the future in order to even justify it's CURRENT market cap. It's actually absurd. It almost seems like people who are investing into Tesla don't really understand what it's current market cap even means... \n\nI've heard from a Tesla investor that Tesla would become an industry leader like hibachi Ltd.... And once that happens Tesla is going to moon..... And its like dude .. hibachi Ltd market cap is at 50b . Forget about mooning once Tesla becomes an industry leader like hibachi Ltd. Tesla would need to be an industry leader like 20 hibachi Ltd  just to even justify it's current valuation lol.... \n\nIf Tesla becomes the world's most profitable corp like apple. Get this .... You'll justifiably only 2x your money if you invest In it now \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 . Bruh such a tall order to fill just to 2x . \n\nLook I get it. Tesla is innovative yadadada yes . The company is still in it's early stages and it'll be better later on. Yes that too. The company is at it's early stages. However, the stock valuation of this company is not. The stock valuation of this company is already at a level where it can swing it's dick around and smack China with it. \n\nThe question is. What would Tesla even need to do.... For profit at a level where it's absurd valuation is justify? \n\nAnother note Toyota is currently the most profitable car company and it's valuation is 300b..... (I'm not saying Tesla is just a car company) Tesla's is already at 1.2t . 4x the most profitable car company already... Without making any profit... Tall order to fill . Let's just say that.",

        "selftext": "I am a college student who recently decided to try my hand in the stock market. I was having fun just moving shares around and making small amounts of money. Then a few weeks ago I decided to try options. I bought an apple call that went up a couple hundred bucks. I was amazed at how easy it was to make money with options. Then I decided to put a bunch of money into Delta Airlines calls expiring in January and February. Initially they went up, and I was making more money than ever before. But then they started to go down. As I'm writing this, my weekly chart is down almost 20%. This is all the money I had in my saving account. I'm not sure when I will crack, but at this rate it will be sometime soon. I'm still holding, but I can't focus on school or anything else because all I can think about is how much money I'm losing.\n\nMy question is, how do you guys deal with waking up in the morning and seeing huge losses? How do you keep going?",

        "selftext": "Background: I\u2019ve been trading options for over a decade and I have no financial or business background. I learned before it was popular online and I am self taught. So I\u2019ll be explaining it the way I was able to understand it. There are better ways, but this is what helped me. I turned $1700 into $500,000 back in 2014. \n\n\nOptions are basically lay aways for shares. So let\u2019s use a house as an example. \n\nIf you bought a house for $1M and I come and offer you $1.2M (the strike price). The catch is I have a certain amount of time to decide if I want the house. You cannot back out but I\u2019m not obligated to buy it. So what\u2019s in it for you? I offer you a $10,000 deposit that you get to keep no matter what happens. Now what? \n\n\nI hold a CONTRACT between us that costed $10,000 and I give myself 6 month expiration date to decide if I want it. So now I am hoping the housing market goes up above $1.2M so let\u2019s go over a few scenarios. \n\nBenefit? I profit on a $1M house as if I own it even though I only paid $10,000. \n\nMARKET RISES\n1. The housing market goes up and it\u2019s now worth $1.4M within 3 months giving me 3 more months on the contract. So the contract is worth at least $200,000 because if I forced you to sell it (exercise). So I can go around and sell the contract to someone else and say \u201clook I can force them to sell for $200,000 today, so give me $200,000 + $20,000 for the 3 months because it could continue to rise. So they pay $200,000 to receive $200,000 in equity and $20,000 premium because the contract still has more time. Meaning if the housing market goes up to 1.5M The new owner of the contract can now exercise the contract (option) and profit $80,000 or 4X their investment. \n\n MARKET DIPS\n2. The housing market dips and the house is now worth $800,000. I would owe you $1.2M so I just wait the 6 months and hope it rises or I sell my contract $10,000 at a loss maybe like $3,000 to someone else hoping it jumps back up. Worse case if the time comes to an end i lose $10,000. \n\nMARKET RISES BUT NOT MUCH. \n1. You do not have to hit the price you bet to earn money. So if the market hits $1.1M within 1 month since there is 5 months left. I can sell the contract to someone else for more now thst it\u2019s more likely to happen. So I can get $20,000 even though it didn\u2019t go over $1.2M. I\u2019m selling the contract to someone else and letting them hope it goes up. \n\nNow translating to stocks. \n\n1 option or contract is 100 shares per contract. \n\nSo if you buy 6 contracts for apple to hit $300 you have 600 shares on hold for you. Every dollar above $300 you earn $600. Because you only owe the owner $300 so everything above is yours. \n\n\nSo your call is you betting it goes up, and if you do a put, you are betting it goes down. Either way you will only ever lose the initial deposit or purchase price of the contract. \n\nStock example I bet Nvidia will hit $360 by feb22 so I needed to pay the owner $15 per share as a down payment. So it was $1500 for the 1 option. Now the closer it gets to the price I said it would hit the price of the contract goes up because it\u2019s now more likely to happen. \n\nSo for example if I said your house will hit $2M by 3 months you wouldn\u2019t believe it would happen so you would accept a lower deposit say $1000 now imagine something happens and 1 week later your house jumps to $1.4M. Since it\u2019s more likely to happen I could sell the contract to someone else for $2500 because it\u2019s not as crazy and I\u2019ve made 150% in 2 weeks. \n\nYou don\u2019t hold a contract till the date, you flip the contract to someone else when you make money on the deposit. \n\nHow are they priced? The crazier your bet the cheaper it is. Tesla at $2000 within 2 months is probably impossible so it would be cheap. Tesla at $2000 by 2024 is more likely so it would cost more. \n\nI turned $1700 into $500,000 from options at 19 back in 2014. But I\u2019ve also lost $100,000 in a day when fedex dipped when gas was low because they buy gas in 6 month intervals. So their earnings were low and the stock dipped. With not that much time left I lost it all. So if it\u2019s your first time, give your self some time in the expiration date . So be careful.",

        "selftext": "\"Apple is not a tech company.

The reason TSLA is not included in this list is because everyone knows that TSLA is a boomer value stock EV company as indicated by it trading at a mere 371x P/E ratio.\n\nIn order to properly value Apple we need to gather estimates of FY 2021E Revenue for the other Disruptive EV companies:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: I pulled every number here out of my ass](https://preview.redd.it/ihetdie5ot081.png?width=338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=556c7d1743c8c73631376b24e4eda27e7fb469fb)\n\nApple is currently trading at a mere 7.28 P/S.

If apple were to grow to a valuation in just the bottom quartile of our sample, AAPL would be at $23,316 a share, a 14,422% gain.",

Literally every shared portfolio, due diligence and stock opinion is finshed with the I invest for the long term, so I do not really care about the price fluctuations. \n\nYet the sheer panic and mood changes on stocks are made after every small dip, missed earnings or change in analyst estimates. \n\nThe thing is, that the value of company and mass concensus here is not made by anything, but simple price change. \n\nThe company\u2019s stock rose singnificantly in the last year?\n\nIt is a complete beast and literally everyone needs it in their portfolio!\n\nThey missed earnings by 50 basis points, there is small change in the estimates for next year and the stock had not changed in a 6 months?\n\nImmediately sell the company, because you are lacking after the last year biggest homeruns!\n\nThe reason why this thing is happening is, because most people do not know or have the slightest idea about how much they value their business! \n\nIf you would have a strong opinion on how much you value your business, you want sell it after you believed that you have paid 50 cents on a dollar for it. Most of you are valueing business on the market price that is quoted last second. \n\nThe other thing is that you do not understand the businesses you own!\n\nNo, saying Iunderstand Coca-Cola because i know it sells Coke is not understanding business. How many of you know the balance sheet of KO, how many of you read the 10Q and 10K, do you know that KO\u2019s payout ratio of their dividends is above 80% and often was 100% plus? Do you know the management? Can you give a pricetag on these cash flows, that KO will make? \n\nAnd this is talking about KO, which is relatively easy to understand company, that nearly everyone has some experience with. I really do not believe that even 0,1% of people who read palantirs reports, looked at its valuation, and most importantly understand the business of the company.\n\nAnswer honestly to yourself.\n\nDo you really know the business you own?\n\nLastly i would want to say a story about mass opinions on companies. Microsoft and Apple were for many years considered mature companies with limited growth. Apple was even considered with negative growth rate. After last three years rally in their prices, the opinion on them changed so much that literally everyone believes that they must have them in their portfolio. \n\nWould you also consider this if the price of the stock did not change?",

[Read TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/canoo-is-setting-up-headquarters-in-walmarts-hometown-picks-panasonic-as-battery-supplier/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALpMekhyzJoLaqvSyFMsBQ7sVoiVZZaqAdFyR2OxdEvGaz6boCqNRiQL3KYZtw_JKMlNlukcf5RkXfXVPbszJtU6Gnlx7xWdBclv1jPzA-goRnQny_1X0kuYlRBY3Sz-wg39pbL1d2irsUNh587CWwtUMTDPl158Kv4pq9s0Qd86) for more details and nice global recap.\n* **The short interest is unsustainable.** Depending on which provider you get the SI numbers you will find between **25% and 35% SI** on GOEV. The days to cover based on [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest) are **15.5**([meaning](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp)). The market cap is only **$2.3bn.** Just for context LCID is $83bn and RIVN $138bn. Among the smaller EV US players Canoo has achieved the most beta testing and Apple wanted to buy them out before they went public to use their skateboard and IP as the basis for Project Titan aka the Apple Car. Shorts are cornered but they are also very strong on this ticker and will do anything to keep the price action contained.\n* Today's price action is very indicative of the long/short story. GOEV opened at 8.50 just +0.05 from previous close. Then mini-mooned at 9.00 and 9.50 milestones. Obviously 10.00+ is the nightmare scenario for shorts going onto OpEx week. They will throw absolutely everything they have to keep it below $10.00 on Friday's expiry. On 1st attempt the stock managed to touch 10.01 then ladder down. On 2nd try 10.05 and ladder down. 10CALL 19-Nov has 18K open interest and almost 10K daily volume as I write. No other strike has a comparable activity.\n\n**quick outro**\n\nBtw not financial advice or whatever. I'm long stocks, warrants, and random calls - all ITM. I'd rather accumulate into one of the strongest IP and business plan at $2.3bn valuation and be on-board of the next moon mission rather than chase $80bn+ FOMOs near fully priced in.\n\n**Bonus watch this &gt;&gt;&gt;** [cool video](https://78449.themediaframe.com/incomm/canoo111521_v2.mp4)",

        "selftext": "Hi fellow retards, been a fellow lurker for a few years now but decided to post because I recently shifted my stance on $INTC and figured I should get the full smooth-brain experience by getting roasted by my fellow apes.  \n\nI figured Intel was done for ever since they stopped making significant progress on their chip performance and neglected their foundry, and was on the AMD hype-train ever since Ryzen 2 launched. However, a lot has changed on the global stage and on Intel\u2019s strategy which signals a new outlook for Intel in the next year. \n\nFirst of all, Intel has seen the writing on the wall. They have gotten sloppy and greedy for too long and have seen their bottom line and image hit the shitter. In response, they have started hiring the talent they need to get their foundry and R&amp;D back on track. They recently hired [Vineet Goel](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-hires-top-amd-gpu-architect-to-lead-xe-ip-roadmap) from AMD to work on GPU architecture, and have hired a slew of [veterans and new talent](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16807/intel-continues-to-rehire-veterans-at-some-point-theyll-run-out) as part of their revamping and have finally started to [move in the right direction](https://www.pcworld.com/article/549611/intel-core-i5-12600k-review.html/amp). Intel definitely sees how they\u2019ve lost their edge to AMD and NVIDIA and are making sure they hire the right talent to turn the tide. They also have deeper pockets than AMD and NVIDIA to make sure this happens (34.6B vs just 3.6B and 7.7B respectively). \n\nOn the other hand, the political stage has completely shifted, and China and the US are more than just on bad footing, as the FBI officially note that . [china is \u201ca threat to our economic security\u2014and by extension, to our national security\u201d](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states). As a result, the US government is currently in a race to decouple as quick as possible from china, and no decoupling is more important than that of the chip-manufacturing industry. \n\nThere is only 1, US-based chip manufacturer, and if you\u2019re also smooth brained, you likely know it\u2019s INTEL. Everyone else just designs in the US and manufactures in Asia, which is an issue because the next big player, TSMC is increadibly close to getting rammed by China because china want\u2019s to [take over Taiwan](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-11-03/china-clearly-developing-ability-to-invade-taiwan-top-general-says). This leaves the US government as well as the  entire private industry up in the air if and when China invades Taiwan (or even just makes shipping to/from Taiwan harder). \n\nYou know who has deeper pockets than Intel? The DoD and they\u2019ve basically decided that Intel has to be the leader for the sake of the entire private industry and US national security ([see here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-wins-us-project-develop-foundry-ecosystem.html#gs.f1t2zi).\n\nIntel will be a big mover going forward because they want to win, the US government needs them to step up their game, and cash is clearly not and will not be an issue. More importantly, Intel is going to be more than just a cpu vendor, they are likely going to be the main foundry for most american chip designers like AMD, Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm",

Roku does produce some small series, but they don\u2019t compete directly with other streaming services. In fact, they compete with a totally different group of companies.\n\nThey compete with other operating systems for TVs like AppleTV, ChromeOS, FireTV. ROKU is a unique Platform/OS just focused on TVs. Own the platform, and you control everything.\n\nThink of them as an advertising platform like Facebook or YouTube but with the power of AppleOS and the App Store.\n\nThink about where most ad revenue is placed. Normally Facebook &amp; Google capture most of the Revenue. However, things got more difficult since advertisers must deal with the new Apple privacy regulations when the ad is placed within the Apple ecosystem.\n\nHere Roku presents its unique possibility for massive adoption among advertisers. Roku offers a unique OS for TVs enabling Roku to sell targeted, personalized ads to advertisers.\n\nPrimarily Roku makes money on their displayed ads, which are shown on their 20,000 Roku Channels. Developers can create channels on Roku for free, making it easy to grow to the number of channels available. Once a channel gets enough traction, it will be monetized.\n\nSecondly, Roku knows their customers and enables a more unique possibility for advertisers to show personalized targeted ads, compared to traditional TV where the customer is mostly unknown.\n\nThirdly, Roku gets a cut on every subscription placed over the RokuOS. Just like Apple gets a cut from every app you pay for\u2026 Own the platform, and you control everything.\n\nRoku recently acquired Quibi for a fraction of a price. Roku paid less than $100 million for global rights to 75-plus Quibi shows. It\u2019s a super successful acquisition for Roku, having a wide library and a unique selling point. You can watch those shows for free by the way.\n\nHow fast is Roku growing? The annual percent growth rate of Roku users grew from Q1 2017 to Q1 2021 is at an impressive rate of 92.48% per year. (Source Statista ) \n\nThe Worldwide, demand for free TV content is massive. [$ROKU](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24ROKU&amp;src=cashtag_click) is aggressively expanding internationally and is being integrated into more TV's globally as we speak. Roku captures a unique opportunity for the global go-to Operating System on TVs.\n\nAs the No. 1 TV streaming platform in the U.S. (based on hours streamed) I am excited about the road ahead. I feel [$ROKU](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24ROKU&amp;src=cashtag_click) has a bright future ahead, given the enormous opportunity it unfolds as the go-to OS for TVs.\n\nThis is not financial advice, please do your own due diligence.

        "selftext": "TLDR:  I did a bunch of math based on some reasonably good ideas to determine a  selection of stocks worth investing in. Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore.\n\n# Observations/Assumptions\n\nBefore  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.\n\n* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.\n* For most people it is impossible to time the market\n* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.\n* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.\n* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)\n* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&amp;P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)\n* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).\n* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)\n* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.\n* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.\n* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:\n   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.\n   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don\u2019t want to support.\n   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that\u2019s because it is.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\nUsing  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&amp;P 500.\n\n# Experiment 2020\n\n750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies\u2019 average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:\n\n* ROE &lt; Index ROE = Poor = 1\n* ROE &gt; Index ROE = Moderate = 2\n* ROE &gt; 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3\n\nFor  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.\n\nThis was done for all of the metrics below:\n\n* ROE\n* Revenue Growth %\n* EBITDA %\n* FCF %\n\nThe  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.\n\nAny stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.\n\n[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)\n\nROE Example\n\nThat left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.\n\nThis  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?\n\nThat left 26 across 7 sectors.\n\n[Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/3gurx91wu6081.png?width=366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e37aa1afdb655721fc83dff4e75867923e48cc1)\n\n**2020 Industry Breakdown**\n\nThese  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.\n\n2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**\n* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**\n\nCan we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.\n\n# Experiment 2021\n\n2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:\n\n* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company\n* Profit Margin \u2013 shows how effective the business is at making money\n* Operating Margin \u2013 shows how much money the company earns on its revenue\n* FCF Margin \u2013 shows how efficient a company is with their cash\n* EBITDA Margin \u2013 shows a companies\u2019 operating profitability\n* ROE \u2013 shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money\n* ROA \u2013 shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits\n* ROIC \u2013 shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns\n* Debt/Equity Ratio \u2013 shows the financial stability of a company\n\nMore  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:\n\n\u00b7  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.\n\nEach  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor &lt; 100%, Good &lt; 150%,  Great &gt; 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.\n\nI  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn\u2019t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.\n\nHere is an example showing Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring:\n\n[Aerospace &amp; Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)\n\nHere is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company\u2019s most recent year):\n\n[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/a2nq8c1av6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1f79a62b587bf6f1530f5beefda1b174b5d7d43)\n\nHere is an example of the visualizations for the data:\n\n[Data Visualization Example](https://preview.redd.it/5d41vcvdv6081.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26567d730e1d668ccef856a18497fab38345577b)\n\nI  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.\n\nNext,  I read the description of \\~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn\u2019t interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it\u2019s oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \\~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I\u2019d  need to build a separate model.\n\nI  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \\~75.\n\nWe were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:\n\n[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0bmcwyuiv6081.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0df395664265ef942ff736c889108711216e76ed)\n\nI then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.\n\n2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:\n\n* **S&amp;P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**\n* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**\n\n# Industry Classification\n\n* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.\n   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.\n   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren\u2019t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.\n* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.\n   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.\n   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).\n   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.\n\n# 2020 Stocks\n\nABMD\n\nADBE\n\nANET\n\nBWXT\n\nCRL\n\nDG\n\nENR\n\nETSY\n\nEXEL\n\nICLR\n\nISRG\n\nKLAC\n\nLKQ\n\nLRCX\n\nMNST\n\nMPWR\n\nMTCH\n\nOLED\n\nPAYC\n\nPHM\n\nTER\n\nTTD\n\nUI\n\nVEEV\n\nVMW\n\nVRTX\n\n# 2021 Stocks\n\nAAON\n\nAAPL\n\nACN\n\nADBE\n\nAEIS\n\nALGN\n\nAMAT\n\nANET\n\nAPH\n\nATR\n\nATVI\n\nAX\n\nBLD\n\nCDNS\n\nCGNX\n\nCHD\n\nCHE\n\nCORT\n\nCPRT\n\nDLB\n\nDORM\n\nEPAM\n\nESNT\n\nETSY\n\nEW\n\nEXPD\n\nEXPO\n\nFAST\n\nFB\n\nFIX\n\nFOXF\n\nFTNT\n\nGGG\n\nGOOG\n\nGRMN\n\nHEI.A\n\nHELE\n\nIDA\n\nINS\n\nINTC\n\nINTU\n\nIRBT\n\nISRG\n\nCCSI\n\nZD\n\nKLAC\n\nLRCX\n\nLULU\n\nMASI\n\nMED\n\nMKSI\n\nMKTX\n\nMNST\n\nMORN\n\nMPWR\n\nMSFT\n\nNMIH\n\nNRC\n\nNVDA\n\nODFL\n\nOLED\n\nOLLI\n\nPAYC\n\nPAYX\n\nPRLB\n\nQLYS\n\nREGN\n\nRMR\n\nROAD\n\nSCCO\n\nSFBS\n\nSLP\n\nSTMP\n\nTDY\n\nTER\n\nTREX\n\nTROW\n\nTTD\n\nTYL\n\nUI\n\nV\n\nVEEV\n\nVRTX\n\nWAL\n\nYETI\n\n# Notes\n\nI  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments.

        "selftext": "Here's a 2.5B company that is on the verge of putting out the most revolutionary vehicles since the beginning of automobiles. Every other company has been building the same vehicle over and over again, Tesla had the bright idea to add batteries but changed nothing else except adding a frunk. EV's offer the opportunity to rethink this design, however Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Fisker, Lordstown, you name it, have opted to manufacture the same damn thing.\n\nCanoo has rethought this formula, and is creating vehicles with more space and less of a footprint. Want a minivan interior with a compact car exterior? Want a truck with a longer bed and more storage space than an F250 in half the footprint? Only Canoo is offering these things, and my bet is that the age of supersized unnecessary vehicles is closing, and the age of efficiency and proper utilization of space is near.\n\nI've been in this company since pre-SPAC and it continues to quietly and thoughtfully move forward. It's signed a deal with one contract manufacturer in Europe (VDL NEDCAR) and has signed an agreement with Oklahoma to build its own facility. Canoo just bumped up it's manufacturing timeline to late 2022 and, just for fun, Apple was in negotiations with this company early on, and if you believe the rumors, they offered to buy it and they were rejected by the leadership team.\n\nAnd just to be as honest as possible, I've owned both the stock and warrants for the last 18 months and it currently takes up about 33% of my brokerage account (it was 8 percent not that long ago but it's gone up and I couldn't help but buy more). Tesla at 1.2B, Rivian at 100B, Lucid at 90B, Fisker at 6.5B....Canoo at 2.5B. Refuse to believe it will stay this way for long.",

        "selftext": "Calling all deep value investors and retards who just want to scroll to the bottom for which strikes to get. This is not a squeeze on the underlying but rather a squeeze on your portfolio balance. \n\nAlright, hear me out. I didn\u2019t even know there were already HIMX posts until after this was written. Enjoy it anyway. \n\nHopefully we haven\u2019t forgotten that we want to own companies that are profitable as fuck. I believe this play presents an asymmetric risk. HIMX is trading at 8.6 PE while competitors are trading at 28.57 PE. Fair market value is $25 based on multiples alone. 174.3m free float. Decent amount of SI (26.6m shares sold short) and 99.4% utilization. CTB fee rising. They also are a healthy company that produces a dividend. If a dividend is too boomer for you it\u2019s because you\u2019re poor and I\u2019m trying to help change that about you so pay attention.\n\nWhat do they do: Himax Technologies, Inc., a fabless semiconductor company, provides display imaging processing technologies in China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Korea, Japan, Europe, and the United States. The company operates through two segments, Driver IC and Non-Driver Products. It offers display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and timing controllers that are used in televisions, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, automotive, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality devices, and other consumer electronic devices.\n\nThe opportunity for additional upside here is that Himax has their hands on the future with virtual reality devices. They have MetaVerse exposure. This is lagging hard compared to other tickers who have recently exploded, and those tickers aren\u2019t even profitable. FB is expecting to spend in excess of $170bln over the next decade making the metaverse possible. \n\nApple is producing its first headset as well - \u201ca mixed reality experience that can handle games in high quality virtual reality with snappy chips and high end displays.\u201d\n\nThink: Ready Player One\n\nBig tech is investing big money into this space and whether we lack the vision for it or not, it\u2019s happening. They\u2019ve already created new position titles at their respected companies to get ahead of this curve. Source: trust me bro. This space is going to create an even higher demand for semi conductor companies let alone those who produce micro displays. We are entering the next evolution of the internet.\n\nBut don\u2019t just listen to me, Fintel claims HIMX to be undervalued and have a high ranking for the company. 90.04 score in their quality metric and 77.9 in value. Recent articles suggest it\u2019s one of the few Taiwanese tickers to own, presenting value and growth. \n\n\nFinancials:\n\n\u201cFor the third quarter, the Company expects further revenue growth from the already high level of Q2 2021. Gross margin shall see another uptick and could reach another quarterly high. With the increases of both revenue and margin, Himax anticipates net profit shall increase substantially in the third quarter.\u201d Massive flex, ok.\n\nThird quarter projections: the company is expecting net revenues to increase 13-17%. \n\nPositions cost distribution: \n26% shareholders are profitable. Sitting on top of a volume shelf looking to move up. 12.3 and 13.94 are the next two largest areas of supply. \n\nQ2 Total Revenue: 365.26m up 95.43% YoY. \nQ2 Net Income: 108.89 an 7,773.54% increase YoY.\nEPS: .62 which is 7,690.00% YoY. The median for its sector is .47. \nROE: 18.68% which is 5,737.00% YoY. The Semiconductor sector median is 2.79%. \n\nThose numbers are so good you\u2019d think I was tripping on acid. Fact check it. Me being high as balls right now has nothing to do with it. Fuckin seahorse sea hell.\n\nTotal debt: HIMX has $159.5m in debt, which is down from $222.4m reported a year ago. They also have $270.4m in cash to offset the debt. This leaves the company $110.9m in net cash. \n\nCash flow: 89% of its EBIT \n\nDividend: .262\nDividend Yield: 2.53%\n\nTechnicals: found hard support at $9.6 and is testing its daily resistance of $11.32. A daily close above this price would present a pivot point. Key areas of resistance past this point would be $14.61 and volume shelf where bag-holders lie waiting, although not many. Institutions are holding at higher prices. \n\nMACD has crossed, bands are squeezing - haven\u2019t been this tight since your mom birthed you crotch goblins. We also have a 9EMA/21MA crossover signaling bullish trend reversal. \n\nOptions: call activity has been bullish recently. Recent sweepers into the 11/19 12c. \n\nTL;DR: future proof conductor company prints hard as fuck right now and in the future. Jan 8c 2022 / 30c 2023 buys you lambo equipped with HIMX shit.\n\nER Thursday before the bell. I don\u2019t want you to get IV crushed but do your thing. I have shares, Jan 8c 2022 and Jan 30c 2023, with intentions of exercising. \n\nFor transparency, this is 15% of the weight of my portfolio and I\u2019m green 11%. I will not sell below fair market value. Godspeed retards.",

        "selftext": "**BULL CASES**\n\n/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.\nYes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.\n\n/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.\n\n/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.\n\nFor reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).\n\n/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.\nWhich would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.\n\n/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.\n\n/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.\n\n/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. \n\nHowever, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.\n\n*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*\n\n/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.\n\n/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.\n\n/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.\n\n/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.\n\n/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?\n\n/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.\n\n**Bear Cases**\n\n/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.\n\n/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.\n\n/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.\n\n/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.\n\n/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.\n\n[positions or ban. bought 100 shares for now. will be selling some puts to enter into more. And then around the next earnings, will buy some calls](https://imgur.com/a/xxYyDIE)",

        "selftext": "**I'ma try an' keep this short an' sweet.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not gonna go in-depth about Canoo as a company. If you're on WSB then you've probably heard of Canoo. Regardless we all just throw money around any way, so fuck it, if you really give a shit then do some research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo cut to the chase, Canoo is having its' Earnings Report next Monday (11/15/2021). Because Canoo is a newer EV company they obviously don't have any true earnings to announce. The idea is that Tony Aquila (CEO of Canoo) will use this call to drop some good news. But will he drop news? and if so, what?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**That's where the true speculation begins.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of information has been leaked that Tony Tequila has not commented on or has barely acknowledged and is not priced-in. The next logical thought process is; What information does Tony Tequila have that hasn't been leaked yet? Will Tony Tequila comment on any of the leaked information or release any new information?\n\nWell, what I'm saying, is that there are known-knowns and that there are known-unknowns. But there's also unknown-unknowns; things we don't know that we don't [know.](https://youtu.be/2msQwpzatQc?t=23)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here's some known-knowns that hasn't received a lot of press and has barely moved the stock price:**\n\n\\- Canoo announcing battery supply agreement with Panasonic\n\n\\- Canoo's attendance of the Certified Pest Control Operators of Georgia's 23rd annual conference\n\n\\- An insane amount of new hires including people from Nio, Tesla, Harley Davidson, etc.\n\n\\- Canoo partnership with VDL Nedcar to manufacture vehicles\n\n\\- Canoo's MPDV nominated for Red Dot Design Award\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here's some of the known-unknowns that Canoo hasn't commented on or has barely acknowledged:**\n\n\\- Pictures of the new sedan (leaked, unannounced)\n\n\\- Frontdoor Collective ordering 10,000 delivery vans by 2024 from Canoo (barely acknowledged, hardly any press)\n\n\\- [AirAsia](https://i.imgur.com/WpY2qVX.png) partnering with Canoo for its' new rideshare program (YouTube video uploaded by AirAsia then made private soon after)\n\n\\-Tony Aquila's Form 4 showing him become a majority shareholder in the company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unkown-unkowns?**\n\n\\- Who the fuck does know. Looking at the past knowns, it could be anything (Canoo-Apple partnership? /s)\n\nThe obvious idea behind unknown-unknowns is that Tony \"butt fuck\" Tequila could release information that hasn't been leaked that no one knows of.\n\n**A little bonus spice:**\n\nNow I want to make it clear that this is mostly an earnings play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I can't leave out the the insane volume of open interest for the 11/19 calls. Currently there are 56,598 options that are currently OTM. 17,069 of them are for the $10 strike. Current stock price as of writing this is is around $8.50. If the 10 strike calls get close to being ITM then GOEV could go parabolic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to reiterate, this is not a GME type fresh orange juice play, this is speculation on the Earnings Report being received well by the market. But the fact that OTM OI is so high, could help this stock fly. Just an added bonus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nCanoo ($GOEV) will release some big news that makes the market excited for the company. When big news then big moves. High OI make stock fly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will add links for proof to the above claims in a comment below. Auto-mod is a bitch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Position:** [1,500 11/19 15c](https://i.imgur.com/vLgP9c6.jpg)",

        "selftext": "Hedge funds are beating the broader market right now and their combined buying power can easily drive stocks higher. Citi just put out a list of the top 10 stocks held by the biggest 50 hedge funds as of the end of Q3. I can't say the list is surprising, but it is interesting to see. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Name|Number of funds holding as top 10 position in size|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|MSFT|Microsoft|26|\n|GOOGL|Google|17|\n|AMZN|Amazon|17|\n|FB|Facebook|15|\n|AAPL|Apple|9|\n|NFLX|Netflix|9|\n|CRM|Salesforce|6|\n|BKNG|Booking Holdings|5|\n|DASH|Doordash|5|\n|MA|Mastercard|5|\n\nIt's noteworthy that just because hedge funds own these stock, that doesn't mean they are completely bullish on them in the near term. It's very possible they are running shorts in the various forms (covered calls, puts, etc) against their own holdings to hedge themselves. \n\n**The only thing that stuck out to me here is BKNG**, which seems  overvalued, given it is trading at a price that is well above pre-pandemic levels and a P/E for this year over 55. Earnings are projected to grow at 130% next year.  That means the company would have about $100 per share in earnings. BKNG has traded very richly for some time, so applying a healthy 25X multiple on earnings, that would project a stock price of $2500 next year. In this market, a p/e of 25 looks pretty low, especially if the company continues to grow revenues quickly.\n\n**Sales for Q3 came in just under $4.7B**, which puts it on pace to exceed 2019 revenues of $15B in 2022 IF the trajectory continues. \n\nBKNG sold off big after its last earnings report, despite the fact they delivered a healthy beat of expectations. The drop is presumably because expectations had grown too high in advance of earnings, on concerns that COVID would impact travel, and on profit taking.  It's now down over 300 points from its high. \n\nIt's interesting to see the trend reversal that just occurred in the travel sector. AirBnB, BKNG, and Expedia, were all up double digits from mid-August and in the past 10 days, all 3 are down. \n\nAttractive entry point for BKNG?\n\nIt could be, but I'm betting the stock will retreat further as COVID cases rise due to holiday travels.  I'll be looking to buy the stock if it dips back to 2,100 again.",

        "selftext": "I've been reading a bunch of random posts online about different companies I'm currently interested in, and I realize I'm happy that I'm an investor and I always will be. \n\nI don't understand how people can exist with a trader mindset. It's seems like you need to study alot of quasi science, be on social media constantly, do alot of cocaine, and it really just seems stressful. \n\nThe neat thing about reddit is I can look and see when people post their \"analysis\" of a stock. Which for 99% of reddit, is just a trader saying voodoo witch craft nonsense about enter and exit points, resistance this and that, cutting losses, and special orders. \n\nThen you ask for their portfolio and they have none or its top secret or something. It's not illegal to share your portfolio you great traders. \n\nI'm an average Joe, and I'm not that smart. so I feel really good when I read posts from people who buy a stock like MU, three years ago, at 40-43 a share, and sell it saying they see no future in it. It's trading at like $83 now. \n\nI love it when I read people saying they bought Uber near ipo at 40 and sold at 32 and say it's doomed to fail. But Uber is still around, in fact it hit a height of $60 last spring and now it's $44. You haven't even given it a chance to grow or become something yet. Like the company is a verb, give it a few years. \n\nI think traders are like fake friends in high school. They're only around you if you're cool. Once you're not cool anymore they abandon you. But traders are onlu a small portion of money for a company a company makes stuff to sell to people and that's what really draws in revenue to grow. \n\nI see alot of people talk about the \"opportunity cost\" or \"oppurtuniy lost, \" something like that when you're not trading. Like if I buy something that isn't moving fast, or something is in the red, it's better to \"cut my losses.\" \n\nBut that's like... Buying high and selling low. \n\nThat sounds like the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather sink with my ship if you're telling me to always sell the moment my stock goes red. \n\nif I was so foolish as to pick a bad company, I'd rather just take the full loss, rather then death by a thousand cuts. \n\nBut I pick companies that make more revenue every year, have increasing dividends, and are medium to large size growth companies. \n\nI'm boring. \n\nI just look at the best performing companies, read their 10k and just invest. My first two companies I bought were Apple and Starbucks, I then bought Nvidia and Realty Income. I bought Pennymac and Weyerhaeuser afterward. I just sorta sit on them. I just hold them and buy more. If I somehow become broke instantly from these decisions then damn. \n\nI'm investing in known companies with easy business models. I like safety and simplicity. \n\nI don't believe I'm gonna become a multi millionaire with several cars and boats. I just want to make enough money to be the first millionaire in my family, and have my children live of my dividends so they don't have to work so hard. \n\nIt just seems like people don't have patience on the internet. And when you take the time to read people who argue about a particular stock, and then for those same people to be proven wrong by time. It feels good.",

        "selftext": " \n\nI want to talk about $VIAC and why it's going to make you MONEY!!!\n\nFirst off, what is $VIAC and what does it include?\n\n1.  CBS- one of the most watched cable networks\n\n2.  Paramount Pictures- makers of the most currently watched tv show \"Yellowstone\" and movies like a Quiet Place and wolf of wall street\n\n3.  Showtime-Premium TV network with many top originals that also does boxing events such as the recent Canelo fight. Also includes Bellator, which has been growing and is the only real competition to UFC.\n\n4.  Includes other Networks like MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, BET-which I\u2019m sure most of you are familiarly with.\n\n5.  Pluto TV- basically like free cable with a large selection of channels. Just tried it out for the first time today and it seems legit, you don\u2019t even need an account to watch. Pluto TV revenue numbers are up 77.7% year over year.\n\n6.  Paramount Plus, it has one of the largest content libraries for shows and movies. Also has deals with NFL, European Soccer Leagues, PGA (golf) and more. Also, paramount plus was one of the most download apps in the apple app store recently. They Also plan on releasing an exclusive movie each week in 2022. [https://www.cbr.com/paramount-plus-debut-new-movie-every-week-2022/](https://www.cbr.com/paramount-plus-debut-new-movie-every-week-2022/)\n\nLet\u2019s talk about upcoming catalyst.\n\n1.  VIAC just announced they added 1 million subs on P+ in the last week. Netflix added 4.4 in all of Q3. \n\n2. This stock also has a small chance of announcing a buy out at any given time. Would be a great target for Amazon or Apple.  \n\nBonus, according to Nasdaq the Institutional Stock &amp; Mutual Fund Ownership is 68.2%. and the Short interest is around 8%. I believe the rebound from the selling pressure happened today, shorts will start to cover and with the low average volume they should drive the price up.\n\nThere's a lot of other great points I missed, these are just some of things that come to my mind.\u00a0 I would recommend spending some time looking into VIAC yourself. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.\n\nI'm holding 15 leaps and just bought 40 35C expiring next week. IMO 35 is the lowest we will go anytime soon. \n\nTL;DR if you want to make some money buy VIAC Shares or Leaps, Fundamentals are as solid as an Applebee\u2019s steak yet lots of growth potential.",

        "selftext": "So every thread I read nowadays concerning stocks such as TSLA and NVDA essentially boil down to whether we can still use fundamentals (P/E) to value growth stocks such as these. \n\nMy argument is no, we can't. The reason is because we simply cannot estimate the future growth of these companies. We can only estimate growth based on what we know now. So for example we can look at profit margins on existing products and anticipate how the demand/margins on these products will change over time. The problem is over 10+ years a lot can happen, so many new ideas/revenue streams will emerge between then and now. Things we didn't think were possible become possible. Things we didn't even think of become the ordinary. \n\nLike who seriously would have predicted MSFT/GOOG/AAPL/FB current earnings to be this high 10 years ago? Nobody. Actually, a lot of people (including myself back in 2014) were saying these stocks had limited growth potential because their upgrades were minimal. I genuinely thought after the iPhone 6 that most people would not feel the need to upgrade their phone every other year. The iPhone 6 was a great phone. I certainly did not expect people to pay over 2x (3x?) the cost of the iPhone 6 for a minimal upgrade, but they did. People want the latest things. Who's to say Apple won't jack costs up to \u00a32.5k for a new phone over the next 10 years? Anybody who suggests this will be ridiculed and people will simply say 'consumers won't accept such a price hike and will choose lower priced alternatives'. \n\nThis is even more true for companies such as TSLA who will be developing so many new products over the next 10 years, how can we possibly assign a value to things we don't even know exist? Anybody who tried would come across like a madman. Imagine trying to put a value on cloud computing 10 years ago, people would've just laughed at you and called it wishful thinking. \n\nAt the heart of it, a lot of us are very analytical people. We don't like to bet on things we can't predict. We also don't like to be seen as sheep, betting on things that everybody else is betting on. We like to think we can go against the grain and find value elsewhere. Unfortunately we just have to accept that these big tech stocks will grow for reasons we can't predict. Get comfortable with that. \n\nThis is not to say that there won't be some sort of 'correction' (read: minor drop). I'm sure there will be corrections over the next 10 years, but waiting for a correction will cost you far more than the correction itself. \n\n*tldr; 'Time in the market beats market timing'.*",

        "selftext": "Many say they will sell their Tesla shares in 2030, the logic behind this is that in 2030 Tesla will reach maturity like Amazon, Apple and grow at a slower rate (10-30% yoy) so for them whatever price the stock reaches doesn't matter to them, only the year \"2030\".\n\nBut is 2030 the best time to sell? Will Tesla yoy growth justify its stock growth?\n\nTesla doesn't have a demand problem cause it sells every car it makes, so their main problem is their supply capacity.\n\nSo this analysys is based on the Utopia principle that Tesla will have enough demand until 2030 and that it will grow at a 40% rate. And that it will be able to build their factories in 12 months without any geopolitical problem and with swift negotiation with the goverments of all the countries.

In the case that Tesla announces a lower number of factories in the next years vs the analysis then their supply wont meet the demand sooner.\n\nIn my opinion Tesla is more than capable to built 3-4 factories at the same time, the main problem would be the lack of human resources, regulatory problems like in Germany, negotiation issues, etc, all external problems that Tesla cant do anything about them.\n\nInternal problems like a lack of money for the new factories are not an issue for Tesla. \n\nOne main advantage that Tesla has is that they can make the new factory better than the last one, so in 2030 they could need less factories to meet the demand by making each factory produce close to 1M like they aim to do in Fremont, this would offset any external problem like in Germany.\n\n**And this is where i ask for help: Has any automaker be able to built 5 factories at the same time? or any other industrial company? Apple, BYD?**\n\nIn my opinion Tesla is a safe bet until 2025, then we will need to reevaluate it, cause predicting 9 years ahead is just guessing, anything can happen.\n\n**In my opinion BYD is the main threat to Tesla. And Starlink is the main threat to Tesla stocks cause even tesla investors will sell some shares and stop buying to buy Starlink shares when it goes public in 5 years.**",

I was sent a Bloomberg article written by Mark Gurman [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle) mentioning that Apple is also accelerating work on their car.\n\nThe apple car's discussions seem to be moving in the direction of something similar to Canoo's models, how the seating should be \"along the sides of the vehicle\" and have an exterior design like the Canoo Lifestyle vehicle. \n\nCanoo has the Multi Purpose Platform, the flattest skateboard design as of now. This platform is designed in a way to carry any type of \"tophat\", this the way Canoo is decreasing it's engineering costs and how they are going to be launching 3 different vehicles  (possibly a forth, pictures of a sedan/sport vehicle were leaked) in 3 different segments. \n\nHere is the speculation: Tony Aquila has made a huge point of protecting IP, part of the reason why the engineering services deal with Hyundai was terminated. They made sure to poach top notch IP lawyer from Harley Davidson to protect it and sidelined VDL Nedcar (their contract manufacturer in Europe) over a hacking attack they recently had. Why would you be so hell bent on protecting IP unless you are going to be licensing it out to other companies (also for corporate espionage, but I'm not sure how often that happens). If they do license the MPP, Apple would only have to focus on what they do best, the design and the user interface and based on the patents Apple has been focusing more on those types of tasks. For example, Apple is exploring the potential of using a phone as the car's infotainment, Canoo has been on board with this concept since its inception. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: 8300 Commons",

And I think, long term, META (Facebook's) big shift and investments into the \"Metaverse\" will be an utter failure, reminiscent of the Xbox Kinect. \n\nYou know why? Just like the Kinect, meta is ALL. CRINGE.\n\nThe marketing? Cringe. The applications? Cringe. Discinnected from reality (literally and figuratively), and cringe. The uses and applications are not widely needed, nor wanted. Lets be honest- VR is cool. But novelty wears off fast- and I only touch my VR headset for Meta titties here and there. \n\nI just saw an AD pumping the metaverse by showing a woman \"pull\" her friend into a packed, hype concert through VR, as if she was there, and dance with her. It was the worst thing my eyes have ever seen. Are these people delusional?\n\n\n\nIn essense, I'm retarded. And I rolled my eyes at Microsoft pushing Kinect, knowing it would fail. Then I rolled my eyes at Apple over-hyping that stupid video avatar crap nobody cared about. And now I'm rolling my eyes at the metaverse itself.\n\nAnd, lets be honest, \"Meta\" is still a heavily under-target company under federal scrutiny, and It also doesnt help that the cry***/nft (uh, cry*** is kinda fine, but NFTs are the biggest scams I've ever seen widely tolerated) bubbles could pop at any point, and many seem to correlate the metaverse to them entirely. \n\n\nHow, my fellow retards, do you think I should best throw away my money betting on the long-term failure of this giant cringe-fest? \n\n\n\nThank. Thank much.",

Revenues are growing at 30% this year and earnings are up 1000% with a PE of maybe 12 for the year.  This is the most profitable year for GPRO since the IPO and its rise to around 100.  They figured it out this time and analysts agree removing the underweight rating had on it for years.  Margins are rising and in the 40% now.  Man GPRO reminds me of Apple when left for dead.

        "selftext": "**BULL CASES**\n\n/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.\nYes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.\n\n/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.\n\n/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.\n\nFor reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).\n\n/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.\nWhich would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.\n\n/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.\n\n/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.\n\n/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming in both power consumption and power. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. \n\nHowever, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.\n\n*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*\n\n/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.\n\n/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.\n\n/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.\n\n/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.\n\n/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?\n\n/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.\n\n**Bear Cases**\n\n/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR by management's conservative estimates.\n\n/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are unreliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.\n\n/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.\n\n/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.\n\n/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 16, 2021**\n\nStocks gained today, with market participants releasing a sigh of relief as new economic data showed consumer demand remains strong despite ongoing supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages. Moreover, major retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), and Home Depot (HD) are set to release quarterly earnings this week, giving us more information into the state of consumer spending in the US. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP.\n\nThe Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers\n\n* Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected\n* Core Retail Sales: +1.6%\n* Manufacturing Production: +1.2%\n\nThe solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. \n\nMatthew Shay, President of the National Retail Federation, said of the report, \u201cToday\u2019s numbers show that consumers are getting a jump on their holiday shopping. We continue to urge consumers to shop early and shop safely, and we fully expect this holiday season to be one for the record books\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, two of the largest retailers in the US, Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD), reported earnings today, with both companies demolishing earnings (though WMT stock did not react positively). Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Walmart (WMT)** \n   * Revenue: $140.53 billion vs $135.60 billion expected \n   * Earnings per Share (EPS): $1.45 vs $1.40 expected\n   * Sames Store Sales: +9.2% vs +6.9% expected \n   * eCommerce Sales: +8% vs +1.9% expected \n* **Home Depot (HD)**\n   * Revenue: $36.82 billion vs $35.01 billion expected\n   * Earnings per Share (EPS): $3.92 vs $3.40 expected\n   * Same Store Sales: +6.1% vs 1.9% expected\n\nThese reports came at the tail end of what has already been an exceptionally strong earnings season. As of Friday, 92% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported actual results, and of these, 81% of them had reported better-than-expected earnings results, according to FactSet.\n\n[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\\_111221.pdf](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_111221.pdf)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Somehow, someway, shares of Rivian (RIVN) keep rising after its blockbuster IPO, with the company now being the third largest auto manufacturer by market cap at roughly $150 billion despite barely completing any deliveries. This is, by far, the craziest valuation I\u2019ve ever seen. \n* The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that import prices rose 1.2% on a monthly basis in October, coming in well above the 0.4% rise for September. This was also above the 1.0% increase consensus economists expected for October, according to Bloomberg data.\n* Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) are on fire after the company projected that its chipset business will average \u201cmidteens\u201d revenue growth through its fiscal year 2024. That\u2019s well above the 8% average contemplated by Wall Street\u2019s current estimates.\n* Netflix (NFLX) is set to release the highly anticipated sequel to Tiger King tomorrow. It seems like Netflix has been on an amazing roll as of late and now has a higher market cap than Disney (DIS)\n* Lucid Motors (LCID) has now overtaken Ford Motors (F) in market cap\n* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly working to make its own in-house modem chip that allows wireless connection for iPhones by 2023. Qualcomm (QCOM), which currently supplies modem chips for all Apple devices, estimates Apple will self-supply 80% of modem chips by 2023. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with four target raises. Stock currently around $235\n   * Citigroup from $282 to $290 at Buy\n   * Wedbush from $250 to $270 at Outperform\n   * Credit Suisse from $250 to $255 at Outperform\n   * Bank of America from $256 to $282 at Buy\n* Datadog (DDOG) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $210 to $230 at Buy. Stock currently around $194\n* Lucid Motors (LCID) price target raised by Citigroup from $28 to $57 at Buy. Stock currently around $57 after gapping up 25%\n* Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) target raised by Benchmark from $81 to $96 at Buy. Stock currently around $85\n* NVIDIA (NVDA) target raised by Credit Suisse from $225 to $400 at Outperform. Stock currently around $300.\n* Tyson Foods (TSN) with a host of target raises. Average price target $95 at Buy. Stock currently aroun d$84\n* UnitedHealth Group (UNH) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $421 to $477 at Buy. Stock currently around $450\n* Workday (WDAY) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $320 to $350 at Buy.

For the past couple of weeks I have become very interested in options because of the leverage they impose but also how quickly something can turn sour. After looking deep into the options chains for various stocks I began wondering what realistic standards are for options and made me think, would a 10% return on a deep in the money option seem realistic. For example, if I were to buy a $AAPL $120 Call, expiring 11/12 (+.10% B/E) Could I realistically expect a 10% return or no? And could I rinse and repeat this cycle of buying deep in the money weekly calls every week or is there an risk that I am not accounting for. Lastly, are there other variables that I am not accounting for or is this manageable? Let me know what y\u2019all think, thanks!",

Compete with that!**\n\n**IN short about Canoo (GOEV):**\n\n$GOEV - Canoo EV maker has surprised (pleasantly this time) its investors with a much faster go to market date (middle 2022 instead of early 2023 and a smaller loss then expected. Old news anyway as there is a lot more coming for them.\n\n***Going long on a stock everybody wants to ask 2 important questions:***\n\n**What can move $GOEV lower (so I don't loose my money) and obviously - what can make it fly?**\n\nLet's start with the first one:\n\n**What can move $GOEV lower?**\n\nHere are couple things that proved painful for investors recently in similar stocks or even for GOEV earlier.\n\nDE**spac shaming - has passed already with many de-spacs performing like in the good old days from 2020.**\n\n**Warrant and PIPE dilution - passed in June.**\n\n**Bonds yields and aversion for risk - passed at least for the time beeing. Bond tapering is in the back mirror and interest rates hike is not yet on the table.**\n\n**Inflation** \\- **this will not pass.** It used to be an initial headwind for every EV, AV, innovation stock but my take is this: they've already spend big money to build their business. No with high inflation, every piece of equipment that hey have already bought, every square meter of concrete in their factory, etc. is already more valuable **because of inflation. Their built/invested assets will only increase in value with big inflation in the next years. Any competitor will have to spend a lot more next year or in 2023 to catch up with them, because of inflation. Pretty good moat there!**\n\nNo that we are good to go, we can move to catalysts:\n\n**What can move $GOEV Higher**\n\nA number of high impact stories are trending in investor communities. Let's take them one by one:\n\n1. **EV Incentives - Canoo is champion in collecting Federal and State incentives - and now is the best time to get those money**\n\nBBB Bill or Social Spending Bill will provide 8K incentive for every EV bought in US in order to boost EV use to tackle climate change. That ca go up to 12.5K if they'll have 4k union workers. But, **wait, not for every EV - but only for those produced in US.**\n\n**Even GM is making EVs but they make them in Mexico. Canoo has factories in US. Not sure about those union workers (that might also happen) but with in their production in 2022, they'll be fully eligible for 8K incentive for every car made.**\n\nThe very first Lifestyle car expected in 2022 will cost some 35K, **BUT** if the BB bill will pass the Senate with EV incentives intact inside, **a Canoo Lifestyle Car will only cost 28K and it will be built in US. Compete with that!**\n\nEven more $GOEV is already in line for **some healthy incentives - 400M** from the factories in Arkansas and Oklahoma.\n\n&gt;\\*\\*\"\\*\\*In June, we announced Pryor, Oklahoma, as the location for our owned manufacturing facility,\" Aquila said. \"We have expanded this partnership to include Arkansas and additional locations in Oklahoma.\"  \nAquila said that the new deals will bring Canoo about $100 million in incentives, on top of the roughly $300 million it has already received from Oklahoma. **\"**(from earnings report).\n\n2. **Apple Car - a story that always reminds of Canoo**\n\nI know, the subject has been up there for years now, but every time APPLE move further or Media is publishing some rumors about it, **APPLE Car is moving the market.**\n\nShort story - Apple is planning for years to create its own car full of gadgets that all IOS users love with one of the most powerful AI on board. Apple is holding tens of Billions and is looking for partners to manufacture this new car.\n\n**What connects Canoo with Apple care?**\n\n**A similar design shared between Canoo and Apple Car** that is user centered, leaves a lot of room to cool displays and is up for grab. Blomberg has some details about that here:\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle#:\\~:text=be%20designed%20around-,hands%2Doff%20driving.,-One%20option%20discussed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle#:~:text=be%20designed%20around-,hands%2Doff%20driving.,-One%20option%20discussed)\n\nCanoo has never made a secret from the fact that has active partnerships and is looking for new blue chip partners that would us its platform. The hole point in their business concept was to have platform that can be integrated by almost any use, by a variety of tech partners, but with distinct accent on user centered vehicle with AV/AI in mind. (rings any bells? Yes - that is Apple car)\n\n**Why the design looks like has been created by the same mastermind? Because IT WAS!**\n\nHere is the second connection:\n\n**The same mastermind engineer Ulrich Kranz**, co-founder of Canoo and former CEO is now the engineer working to develop Apple Car.\n\nWith a back ground in top EV engineering at BMW (i3 and i5) and Faraday Future for a while, Kranz has joined Apple earlier this year. You might say that leaving Canoo for Apple is a bad sign - but Kranz has kept is co-founder status at Canoo and Apple has always confirmed that will work with out sourcing partners to develop the car.\n\nThis is only the last records connecting them but the links go much deeper, even from the founding efforts of Canoo.\n\nOne of the main investors in Canoo is the Chang family, the same family controlling TPK, the Taiwan based company that provides that nice Apple displays and has done so since Iphone1.\n\nAnd there is one more story that needs more documentation:\n\n**Canoo - WALLMART partnership rumor** \\- well this more of a rumor based on moving its headquarters and the opening of a new manufacturing facility in Bentonville, Arkansas (Home of Wallmart). I wouldn't bet my money on it if I wouldn't have had already for all the other reason to invest in $GOEV.\n\nIt would not surprise me if indeed they work on a partnership but until we know more about it... we can only hope.\n\n**UPDATE 1 -  today surfaced the news that Canoo Inc (GOEV) Executive Chairman and CEO Tony Aquila Bought $230.3 million of Shares \\[GuruFocus\\] sending a pretty string bullish signal for the stock.**\n\n **UPDATE 2 -**  Yesterday ORTEX was data showing that Friday, there were 31M shorted float on $GOEV.\n\nSo you'd think that yesterday spike was also because many short sellers closed positions, right?\n\nToday - ORTEX is showing that Monday (yesterday) when stock popped with some 15-20% UP, the short seller increased that number.\n\n**Last data on GOEV shows 32.5 M, so some 32% of the float, while the stock has turned bullish.** \n\n*Just you know - I am long on $GOEV with $27K in common, 500 Dec. 17 call @$12.5. and even some 300 26 Nov. Call @$12.5*\n\nHave fun!",

Costco, Nvidia, Apple, it's all just become ludicrously overvalued (Costco's ev/ebitda doubled since 2019, nvidia's ev/ebitda went 6x). Around the same time there's been this trend of small caps getting crushed into the dirt, not in small part due to extreme short action. Do you think that when the large indexes finally correct small caps will just go down more? Or will at some point all doom and gloom be priced in and investors will stop selling their shares? Especially certain cannabis companies are priced at a extremely compelling valuation (Green Thumb is projected to grow 30% annually well into 2023 while trading at a fwd ev/ebitda of 12). Same for Village Farms ($VFF). I'm hesitant on jumping in with both feet due to the obscene valuations in large caps, I fear that their eventual correction will drag down anything and everything. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",

Please let me know what your thoughts are and if there is anything I missed.\n\nTLDR: This company is undervalued, but has a lot of debt on the balance sheet. They are planning on a big merger which may justify buying into the company at these levels.\n\n*Disclaimer: I do not currently own a position in this company, but I am looking to build out a position ahead of the merger.* \n\nIf you want to view the post with the pictures embedded you can look at my substack post [here](https://joshsinvestmentideas.substack.com/p/discovery-value-trap-or-undervalued). \n\n**DISCA/DISCB/DISCK - Discovery:**\n\n\u201cWe are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including linear platforms such as pay-television (\"pay-TV\"), free-to-air, and broadcast television, authenticated GO applications, digital distribution arrangements, content licensing arrangements, and direct-to-consumer (\"DTC\") subscription products. As one of the world\u2019s largest pay-TV programmers, we provide original and purchased content and live events to approximately 3.7 billion cumulative subscribers and viewers worldwide through networks that we wholly or partially own. As of September 30, 2021, we had 20 million total paid DTC subscribers. We distribute customized content in the U.S. and over 220 other countries and territories in nearly 50 languages. We have an extensive library of content and own most rights to our content and footage, which enables us to leverage our library to quickly launch brands and services into new markets and on new platforms. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms.\u201d [Q3 10Q Filing](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/DISCA-2021.9.30-10Q-Filed-copy.pdf)\n\nDiscovery owns a lot of its own content and replays them on its own channels. This is going to be huge for Discovery\u2019s new move into the direct-to-consumer space under their service named **Discovery+.** Also, they currently have an upcoming merger deal that they will hopefully close in the middle of 2022. This deal will merge Discovery inc. with Warner Brothers media. I will touch on this later in more detail, but just know that there is a lot of content that they have already on the sideline that is sought after by viewers.\n\nBelow is a list of the channels owned by Discovery:\n\n[US Networks Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/VU79f0m)\n\n[International Networks Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/q5b8xHu)\n\n**Discovery breaks itself down into the following segments:**\n\n* **USA Networks and International Networks each have the following categories**\n   * **Advertising -** \u201cAdvertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and economic conditions.\u201d [- Q3 10Q Page 36](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/DISCA-2021.9.30-10Q-Filed-copy.pdf)\n   * **Distribution - \u201c**Distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks, supplemented by revenue earned from subscription video on-demand content licensing and DTC subscription services.\u201d [- Q3 10Q Page 36](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/DISCA-2021.9.30-10Q-Filed-copy.pdf)\n   * **Other -** This is miscellaneous revenue related to the specific networks.\n\n*Note: There were revenue increases, but this is also due to acquisitions made by Discovery Inc. rather than only the core business. While the acquisitions strengthen the core business now I just wanted to note that in case you see some odd revenue upticks such as 2018 when Scripps was acquired.*\n\n*Below you can see how the revenues have grown since 2013:*\n\n[Revenue Screentshot](https://imgur.com/a/5hjdKn4)\n\n**Financials:**\n\n* Total Revenue TTM as of Q3 2021: $11.89B\n* Profit Margin has been floating between \\~12% - 15%\n\n[Profit Margin Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/5T2mtyf)\n\n* Current P/E: \\~15\n   * DISCA: \\~15\n   * DISCB: \\~20\n   * DISCK: \\~14\n* EV/EBITDA: \\~3.53\n* Current Cash as of Q3 2021: $3.116B\n* Total Debt as of Q3 2021: $14.785B\n\n**Industry**\n\n* One trend that has been noticeable especially over the last few years is the move from cable TV to the online subscription model(See Chart 1 below). Discovery just launched their subscription service, Discovery+, at the beginning of the year they have been able to amass 20M subscribers. The large majority of its revenue and advertising are still being brought in from the traditional cable tv market, but that is why they have launched their own DTC subscription service. Fortune Business Insights released a report where they expect the \u201cVideo streaming market\u201d to reach an $842.93B valuation with a 12% CAGR. This is up from the $342.44B market size in 2019 ([Link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/12/2333147/0/en/Worldwide-Video-Streaming-Market-Industry-is-Expected-to-Reach-USD-842-93-Billion-by-2027-at-a-CAGR-of-12-0-from-2021.html)). They are going to be competing with companies/services like Netflix, Disney+, FuboTV, Roku, Amazon Prime, Apple TV, and Peacock.\n   * Now this industry growth is huge and CEO David Zaslav expects Discovery to gain some market share, especially with the upcoming merger with WarnerMedia. Zaslav stated that \u201cWe think it could be \\[up to\\] 400 million homes over the long term\u201d when speaking about the expected subscribers.\n\n[*Chart 1: Cable TV forecast through 2028 from Grand View Research*](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/pay-television-tv-market)\n\n**Merger with WarnerMedia:**\n\n* In the first half of 2021 Discovery and Warnermedia announced an exciting opportunity to merge their brands to create a new entity. This deal was an absolute steal because AT&amp;T is essentially spinning this off at a loss and Discovery will have access to a huge lot of movies and shows with large brands. Below you can see the mixture of Discovery brands and Warnermedia brands that are going to be combined under this merger. One item to note is the large number of sports channels that are owned by both companies since there will likely be an offering for live streaming the games or events through the DTC platforms rather than just traditional cable tv channels. One of the great things about Discovery\u2019s TV shows is that they do not cost as much as the high-budget WarnerMedia items because of the way that \u201clive\u201d tv is produced versus scripted TV shows. Also, since these TV shows have already been produced and paid for via the original advertising, both platforms now have the opportunity to sell these brands for a \u201csecond\u201d time without needing to incur any more charges besides the cost of maintaining the platforms. While Netflix has been trying to create their own TV show brands they still license a large portion of their current offering which is why this HBO and Discovery merger is such a big move. One of the great parts of merging the companies is that the subscribers likely won\u2019t cannibalize each other due to the difference in content. We will likely see an offering similar to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN where there are combined packages, but also separate offerings in case you only want one product. As of Q3 2021, **Discovery currently reported that they have 20 million subscribers(**[**link**](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/discovery-q3-2021-earnings-warnermedia-streaming-david-zaslav-1235103627/)**) and AT&amp;T reported that HBO and HBO max have 69.4 million subscribers(**[**link**](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/hbo-max-q3-2021-subscribers-att-warnermedia-earnings-1235094282/)**).**\n\n[Combined Channels and Series Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/wkfvuKi)\n\n* **Financials of the Merger**\n   * The first item to note is how the actual deal will work for the shareholders and Discovery &amp; AT&amp;T\u2019s portion of the deal. Discovery will own 29% of the new company while AT&amp;T will own 71% of the new company. Also, DISCA, DISCB, and DISCK will be merged into one set of shares which is why I will be buying the C shares and using the C shares valuation for my numbers. These trade at a discount due to the lack of voting rights.\n\n[Spinoff Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/CTcT0a0)\n\n* Now the economics of the deal have been spelled out and shown via the presentation made in the middle of the year ([link](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_presentations/2021/ATT-Discovery-WM-05172021-FINAL.pdf)). The merger is expected to have \\~$52B of revenue and \\~$14B of expected EBITDA in 2023(Slide 10). Along with this revenue expectation they are targeting $15B+ of direct-to-consumer revenues in 2023. They expect to have around \\~4.5x to \\~5x leverage compared to their expected EBITDA. Zaslav recently mentioned that he expects the debt leverage to be around 4.5x ([link](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery-zaslav-kevin-mayer-1235103664/)).\n\n[Expected Revenue Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/zuZ8bFr)\n\n* Lastly, the sum of parts valuation presented by The Popular Investor Channel ([link to the explanation](https://youtu.be/4qyFRi51BY4?t=1164)). There are multiple ways to come up with a sum of parts for this evaluation, but I wanted to use Rob\u2019s video so that new investors can follow along rather than needing to spell it all out here(.....aka I am being lazy). I recreated his sheet on the DCF worksheet if you would like to go in and make your own edits. I think his calculation looks like the correct estimate, but I think the multiple should be 11 while the net debt/EBITDA ratio can be a little higher (This is to be more conservative). I will leave it the same on the sheet so you can see the comparison, but you can clearly see there is a lot of upside on this. You can also use terminal multiples to come to a conclusion if you would rather take a \u201csimpler\u201d approach.\n\n[Sum of Parts Screenshot from The Popular Investor Channel](https://imgur.com/a/fJfLSzY)\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. Brand Name and reputation - \n   1. Discovery Inc. has a ton of household names for both the channels/production they own and the actual shows that they produce. \u201cDiscovery networks are also among the most-watched networks on TV. For traditional TV ratings during the most recent quarter (Q1 2021), Discovery held four of the top 15 primetime networks among its key demo of women 25-54 (TLC ranked #1.\u201d ([Link](https://corporate.discovery.com/discovery-newsroom/discovery-networks-claim-top-rankings-in-2021-beta-research-brand-identity-study/))\n2. Subscriber Growth\n   1. They have reached 20 million subscribers on just the Discovery+ platform in 3 quarters since it just launched at the beginning of this year. The ad spend has slowed down due to the upcoming merger and they plan to package HBO Max and Discovery+ into an offering for both platforms.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n1. Current Leverage position\n   1. Their total debt as of Q3 2021 is $14.785B and their TTM FCF as of Q3 2021 is $2.082B. While the management team has a good track record of lowering debt quickly it is still an important item to note because of the risk this poses to the business model. If you would like to see the makeup of their current debt you can look on pages 18 &amp; 19 of their [Q3 2021 10Q](https://s27.q4cdn.com/187472364/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/DISCA-2021.9.30-10Q-Filed-copy.pdf) for a better explanation of their debt. This is a big risk to the business if there was any substantial downturn in the US economy since they would likely not be able to keep up with their debt payments. This should be factored in with your margin of safety because of the large debt component. The merger will also have a good amount of leverage, but we are focusing on just Discovery so I did not want to include it on the risks just yet. Once the merger is approved we will add in the new debt here.\n\n[Debt Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/Si2vr7a)\n\n1. Merger not being completed or being stopped by regulators\n   1. Discovery has a lot of content for viewers, but it is likely not enough to get substantial gains on the subscriber growth front of their business. David Zaslav knows that they need to be operating at scale and see that the merger will allow them to do just that. While there are agreed-upon penalty payments depending on who terminates the merger, if it were announced that the merger did not go through we will likely see a short-term decline in stock price. This market has been very reactionary and from the most recent earnings call it sounds like this company has the green light so far.\n\n**Discounted Free Cashflow Model**\n\nIf you would like to see my worksheet the link is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XyElNFu4BY9mg_EbU52NGzYCaOw5B0jBtFkOpXMygLI/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n[DCF Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/OZiYVLG)\n\n**What are their plans for the future?**\n\n1. Merge with WarnerMedia and grow out their Discovery+ platform along with HBOMax to give customers value. \n2. Decrease leverage from an estimated 5x leverage going into the merge to 3x leverage.\n\n**Closing Thoughts:**\n\nThere is a lot of risk in respect to the current debt on their balance sheet and the incoming leverage if the merger is approved. The management team has proven that they are aware of the effects of leverage and want to pay it down, but if there is a substantial downturn in the economy it will hurt Discovery the higher their leverage. The opportunity with WarnerMedia is going to be huge if they are able to merge the company\u2019s costs and employees. If/When the merger goes through they will have a lot of the top-performing channels and the top-performing tv and movie series. I currently like this company and plan on adding around the $25-$26 level for DISCK.",

        "selftext": "# How to think about Stock Ownership.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst I'd like to talk about what a stock is not. **A stock is not a random number generator** on your phone. It is not a squiggly line that bounces up and down. It's not a lottery ticket. A stock is a partial ownership in the underlying business. And in the long run, the stock's price will track the value of the underlying business. In the long run. But in the short run anything can happen. The two can diverge wildly. In fact, I can pretty much guarantee that if you own a particular stock for long enough, you will see it decline in price by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50%. And it may stay down for days, weeks, months, or years. If that isn't something that excites you, then you shouldn't own individual stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotice how I said that **declines in price should excite you**. That may seem counter-intuitive. Isn't it a good thing when your stocks increase in price? No, not if you're a net buyer of them. If you're a net buyer of something, you should want the price to go down. If you're a net seller of something, you should want the price to go up. What you want is for your stocks to increase in value. This may seem like a pedantic distinction, but it's really at the core of value investing. Price is what you pay and value is what you get. In short, **you want declining price and increasing value**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone once asked me why I thought long term. That's because I cannot predict stock prices over a short-period of time. They're essentially random. But what I can do, is find a handful of companies that I think will increase in value over the next 5 or 10 years. And if I don't pay too much for those companies, I should do very well. In the next few episodes, I will get into what I look for in businesses, both from a qualitative and quantitative standpoint, and how I think about valuation. But for today, I want to focus on stock ownership.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I were to go to a cocktail party, and someone asked me what I did for a living, and I told them that I owned a laundry mat or a car wash, no one would think I was crazy. No one would think I was risky. They'd just assume I was a small business owner. Or if I were a dentist and I owned by own practice, no one would find that particularly risky. Or if I had some 9 to 5 job earning a steady paycheck, no one would think that was dangerous. But I think all of those things are more dangerous than stock ownership. A laundry mat is a shitty business. You have to hire people to work for you, and keep the machines in order, and hire lawyers and tax accountants, and it really just seems like a complete headache. Or if you have a 9 to 5, most of the net present value of your future cash flows are wrapped up in that job, and you could be laid off or injured or something of the sort. A computer program could replace you. To me, that seems dangerous. But I don't think owning a handful of superb businesses is dangerous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I think owning Apple or Google is a lot less dangerous than owning a laundry mat, but if you told someone that you had over 50% of your portfolio in Apple they'd think you were crazy.** They would say that is risky. That's nonsense. If you look at the richest people in the world, most of them have most of their net worth in a handful of companies, and in many cases, a single company. Having a really great idea, and having the balls to bet on it, is how most people get rich. Most people don't get rich off their 20th best idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd you don't need to have more than one or two good ideas a year to make a lot of money. If you can find one amazing company a year, you're doing fine. Figure if you have a portfolio of five to ten companies and your average holding period is five to ten years, then you just need one new company a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The problem a lot of people get into, is they sell out of their best ideas.** People will buy a company and then sell it because the price went up. They'll say you can't go broke making a profit. But unless you're taking that money out of the stock market, it has to go back somewhere. So what you'd end up doing is taking it out of a one stock and putting it in another. And maybe that next stock isn't as good. Or some people sell a company because the stock price has gone down. They use stop-losses, for example. Stop losses never made any sense to me, it would be like if you had a house for sale for let's say $1 million dollars. You tell your realtor, if someone offers you $950K, don't accept it. But if someone offers you $900K, accept it. It doesn't make any fucking sense. But people think that way. And some people will sell a stock because it's gone sideways for too long. They get bored and want to move into something else. So what you have is investors who will sell a stock if it goes up, sell if it goes down, or sell if it goes sideways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when should you sell a stock? Well the simple answer is when something better comes along. Taxes are no joke, so you should account for them if you're going to sell out of one stock to buy into another. I could probably do a whole episode on when to sell a stock, so I'll save that for later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne last thing I want to say about stock ownership though, is that I treat it as if it were a small business. **I think of my small business as a conglomeration fo Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Take Two Interactive.** Now clearly, I don't have any executive power over those companies. I can't walk into an Amazon Bookstore and start demanding changes. I have no control over them. And that's fine, I don't want control over them. What I have control over is where I put my capital. That's my job as owner of my little business. I allocate capital. That's it. If I think management is doing a good job, I may invest more capital in their businesses and if I think they're doing a poor job, I'll pull out my capital. It would be like if I divested from a failing division.\n\n**And I think stocks provide you with a way to own an amazing small business.** If you had $100K, what kind of small business could you run? Perhaps the aforementioned laundry mat. Well with stocks, you can own a $100K microcosm of Apple. And you get all of the smartest people in the world working for you, and you're paying them essentially nothing if you stop to do the math. You get to leverage that brand name and have global recognition of your products and services. It's an incredible business, and you get to buy it with no contracts or legal fees. No real work is expected of you, other than just maintaining a working knowledge of the business. It's really a goldmine of an opportunity.\n\n**I think stocks are the easiest way for the average American to live the American dream.** Work hard, save, and invest. You won't get rich quick, but you will get well to do eventually.",

        "selftext": "Canoo ($GOEV) is up 23% this morning due to rumors that it has landed Walmart as a partner. This rumor started because Canoo moved its headquarter to Bentonville, the home of Walmart headquarters. Canoo also teased during its earnings call that it will be building some prototypes for an unnamed partner, which of course the internet jumped on the idea that it must be Walmart.\n\nI'm a little skeptical of this, since Walmart already has other car partners like Ford and Gatik. Does it make sense to add Canoo?\n\nMy thesis is that Canoo is a decent speculative stock even if it doesn't have this Walmart deal. There's lots of other tailwinds such as:\n\n* The infrastructure bill.\n* Canoo fills a niche that's not directly competitive against Rivian or Tesla (and definitely not Lucid). For example Canoo would be great for local governments and schools which will be forced to go green and would like vehicles with low maintenance costs.\n\nPossible cons:\n\n* Worried that Canoo doesn't manufacture it's own vehicles.\n* Canoo already had one hyped up story with the acquisition talks with Apple. If this Walmart thing go south investors will *really* hate Canoo.\n\nDisclosure: I bought some Canoo this morning, and I kinda like their aesthetic.",

        "selftext": "I bought a couple stocks in my play account when I started investing (mid 2 end 2019): SONY, MSFT, NFLX. But ended up buying a SPY Tech ETF. When I looked back I saw that SONY at times actually outpferforms Microsoft and that for close to 10 years. Granted they were beaten to the ground prior in 2010 but how their last CEO turned that business around in pretty much all areas is a masterwork. When I did more research I found out that an important factor to their success was their CFO at that time, who has become their current new CEO in just 2 years.\n\nAt first I was mostly interested in their Playtation devision because I see how far ahead they are in storytelling and grahpics compared to other AAA developers and publishers.\n\nBut now I actually like each divison they are in:\n\nTelevision/Pictures: they dont have a big streaming service but they produce like 2 or 3 of Netflix biggest hits (The Crown, Bridgerton, Cobra Kai, Better call Saul) and they did Breaking Bad. I feel their television arm is morphing more and more into another HBO quality wise. I expect Netflix, Apple, Amazon and Disney to lit. fight for this content in future and Sony television can easy profit. And well Spiderman: Now way Home is a Sony movie afterall and breaking records for that franchise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMusic: Sony Music is the 2nd largest Music label in the world and they are not stopping growing. Again they dont own a streaming service, but they make equal good money by licensing and with the closer becoming fan interaction of artists and their fans --maybe in VR-- (where Sony is also big into btw.) I can see them going a more direct way to present live conerts etc. skipping Spotify, Youtube etc. They already partnered up with one of the big 3 kpop labels to get as one of the first big music labels exposure to that lucrative market, so they are in the Zeitgeist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElectronics/Sensing/Imaging: I see mostly growth in Sensing and imaging technology for the EV market(cars and other vehicles). Electronics I dont think is too hot at the moment but I see their TVs and Smartphone being in the premium segment now where margin is better. Its already worth it to have that direct 2 consumer relationship imo and they can build up from here with VR and AR devices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGaming: With Tencent is Sony the best and fastest growing Gaming company imo.\n\nThey are quite heavily advancing with their Playstation Studios portfolio aquiring left and right and increasing their existing studio size. I am not into the metaverse talk, but when Playtation would want to one Im sure they could. They talk how they want more exposure to 1st party big multiplayer titles, whereas last generation they mostly concentrated their efforts to deliver big quality singe player games. Mulitplayer brings more profit, so thats bullish. They are also devloping Playstation VR2 for release in 2022, which would for example let you play also any non VR game with rudimentary VR support. With all the metaverse (bullshit)talk I can see that reveal create kinda a buzz.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey also own Sony Bank, one of the biggest japanese digital banks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut thats about their current divisions. In the coming years, they plan to enter semi business in corporation with TSMC and build up a new core business pillar for them as they call it: Anime. They now own the biggest box office anime hit in history with Demon Salyer. That IP is so big, it generated 8 BILLION USD in revenue ([https://animesweet.com/anime/demon-slayer-the-series-unstoppable-success-topped-8-billion/](https://animesweet.com/anime/demon-slayer-the-series-unstoppable-success-topped-8-billion/)).  Granted, across different companies and with Merch, (mobile/console)games etc. but when they can create one such anime hit, they have the chance for another. Netflix for example produces --while quality anime content-- but not one of that caliber of Demon Salyer. With Sony having much closer ties to many japanese anime studios I can see them creating the defacto streaming service and having a chance for that next One Piece killer. Merch is brining in the money, not the movies itself. They already own Funimation and Crunchyroll and are currently working on combining them...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYTD performance: 36%\n\nMarket Cap: 154B\n\nPast 5 years: 304%",

Target Corp. fell after warning that cost pressures are increasing, fueling fears that inflation may eat into retailer profitability. The NASDAQ 100, which is heavy on technology, beat key indexes, spurred by a rally in tech titans Apple and Tesla.\n* According to GS' CEO Solomon markets may face a rough period as the economy attempts to recover from the rapid impact of the epidemic.

Facebook has, and frequently is in, a shaky PR right now. But their balance sheets are amazing; they have lot\u2019s of cash flow and all of the necessary parts (VR, User base, and software) to make the Metaverse the next big thing. Many big tech companies and people, such as NVDA and even Elon Musk, believe that the Metaverse is the future of social media. Not to mention that FB is very low right now and has proven to be reliable during its worst times.\n\nAny advise on how you would compare Google and Microsoft? I find them very similiar; cloud computing, with Google more invested with Ad revenue and AI whereas Microsoft leading corporate software and productivity.\n\nApple will dominate the consumer technology sector over the next few years, no doubt.",

        "selftext": "PayPal Holdings Inc. has a reputation for disrupting the payments ecosystem, but it \u201cnow risks getting disrupted\u201d itself, according to an analyst. Bernstein\u2019s Harshita Rawat downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform Wednesday, citing various competitive pressures for the digital payments giant. Shares of PayPal PYPL, -4.36% are off 2.5% in premarket trading.\n\nRawat worries about the \u201cincreasing aggregation\u201d of e-commerce activity on large platforms like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.23% and Shopify Inc. SHOP, -2.24%, which she estimates are together responsible for about 32% of U.S. commerce. \u201cAmazon currently doesn\u2019t accept PayPal and just agreed to accept Venmo starting in 2022,\u201d she wrote. \u201cShopify has ambitions of creating its own payments business and has been pushing its merchants aggressively to convert to Shopify payments platform (and also towards the Shop Pay button).\u201d\n\nSmaller merchants \u201care PayPal\u2019s bread and butter, and Shopify\u2019s meteoric rise and push towards its own payments platform is particularly problematic,\u201d Rawat continued. PayPal\u2019s transaction economics are better with smaller businesses than with very large ones, she argued. Shopify Inc. represents an \u201cunassailable competitor\u201d when it comes to the small-business demographic, in her view.\n\nRawat is also concerned that PayPal\u2019s market-share gains will slow. The company has typically won share at the expense of manual card entry onto a website, but fewer consumers are entering their card information this way, she said, meaning there is less available land to grab there. She estimates that manual card entry now accounts for about 20% of e-commerce checkout, down from roughly 33% four years back. More broadly, she thinks that share gains could slow \u201cby a thousand cuts\u201d thanks to the rise of a number of technologies that separately eat away at opportunities for PayPal. These include the growth of buy-now pay-later (BNPL) services, the ability to auto-fill credit-card information on some web browsers, and the threat of Apple Pay as ever more commerce shifts online. \u201cIt is an understatement to say that the payments landscape is rapidly evolving with many powerful trends emerging,\u201d Rawat said in her note to clients. \u201cWhile PayPal is actively investing and evolving, it simply has more turf to defend versus peers in our view.\u201d Rawat acknowledged that her thesis could prove incorrect if PayPal delivers upbeat surprises with its efforts to drive more revenue from its Venmo app and its \u201csuperapp\u201d redesign that focuses on features beyond just payments. \u201cAfter years of false starts, we believe Venmo is finally on the cusp of getting monetized,\u201d she wrote. While Rawat has \u201chistorically been skeptical of aggressive monetization estimates for Venmo,\u201d she feels more \u201cconstructive\u201d now. \u201cVenmo monetization is now less about following the PayPal playbook and more about following Cash App\u2019s journey,\u201d she wrote, referencing Square Inc.\u2019s SQ, -2.78% mobile wallet.\n\nShares of PayPal have declined 20% over the past three months as the S&amp;P 500 SPX, -0.26% has risen about 6%.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-now-risks-gettingdisrupted-by-competitors-analyst-says-in-downgrade-11637160014?mod=mw\\_quote\\_news](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-now-risks-gettingdisrupted-by-competitors-analyst-says-in-downgrade-11637160014?mod=mw_quote_news)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 18, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed on Thursday, with Nasdaq (QQQ) massively outperforming on the day, driving by strength in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell for the second straight day. Market participants continue to digest the tail-end of a better-than-expected corporate earnings season amid a backdrop of rising inflation. \n\nKey Numbers For Today \n\n* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.34%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.04% \n* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.13%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.41%\n* Apple (AAPL): +2.9%\n* Amazon (AMZN): +4.14%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +8.25%\n* Alibaba (BABA): -11.26%\n* Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID): -16.4% and -10.47%\n\nAfter a monster run-up last month, the choppiness in the market can be attributed to mixed economic reports coming out recently. While US retail sales came in better-than-expected, a great sign that consumer demand  is staying robust, the recent report on inflation showed the fastest pace of growth in roughly 30 years. \n\nEarlier in the week, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), two of the largest retailers in the US, reported earnings. While the report was better than expected, executives from both companies raised concerns over rising prices, rising labor costs, and supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. \n\nThe possible staying power of inflation remains the central focus for market participants, as a potential damper to consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP and as a catalyst for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than originally expected. Despite starting to taper the pace of quantitative easing, the Fed has remained very accommodative and says an interest rate hike could take place sometime near the middle of next year. It would be really bad for markets if the timeline is accelerated. \n\nAdding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. \n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:** 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week \n* **Continuing claims, week ended November 5:** 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) fell after the company disappointed in their latest earnings report and slashed guidance for the full year, citing slowing consumption trends in China. Here are the numbers:\n   * **Revenue** $31.15 billion vs $32 billion expected\n   * **EPS**: $1.74 vs $1.93 expected. \n   * **Guidance Forecast:** 20-23% growth in fiscal 2022 revenue, down from 27% growth expected\n* Shares of NVIDIA (NVDA), my personal favorite stock, exploded higher after the company posted record revenues in gaming and data center sales and raised guidance moving forward. CEO Jensen Huang said, \u201cDemand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies. NVIDIA RTX has reinvented computer graphics with ray tracing and AI, and is the ideal upgrade for the large, growing market of gamers and creators, as well as designers and professionals building home workstations.\" Here are the numbers:\n   * **Revenue:** $7.1 billion versus $6.81 billion expected.\n   * **Earnings per share:** $1.17 versus $1.11 expected.\n   * **Gaming revenue:** $3.22 billion versus $3.18 billion expected.\n   * **Data Center revenue:** $2.94 billion versus $2.69 billion expected.\n   * **Forecast for Q4:** Revenue and EPS expected to grow 50% year-over-year, much higher than 38% growth expected\n* A bipartisan coalition of State Attorney Generals said it was launching an investigation into Instagram\u2019s effects on children and Facebook\u2019s role in promoting the service to young kids. \n* According to a report by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, Apple (AAPL) is working to speed up development of its electric car and is refocusing the project around full self-driving capabilities. According to the report, the company is pushing for a debut as early as 2025.

My main question is:\n\n&gt; **Do you think Disney will do a good job of expanding into gaming**?\n\nI feel like Disney generally has been perhaps too cautious. Years ago they had chances to deepen their relationship with Riot Games, but they let that slip through their fingers. Now Riot has a hit on Netflix which could've been Disney's. This is a big shame since Riot has an incredible universe of character and worlds that would be as good as a mini Marvel.\n\nDisney has so much great IP if they can crack the gaming code, add that to their ESPN and merchandising expertise it will be huge.",

        "selftext": "So I\u2019m a 20 year old college student who is currently putting 100-150 a week into the market and I was wondering where I can put my money so that I can hopefully get higher returns than what I\u2019m currently averaging. Right now, I have about 85-90% of the money that I have invested into total market index funds (FSKAX) or large tech companies (AAPL or MSFT). I\u2019m not not really looking for something that I will have to closely manage since I still have to focus on school and work but I want to invest in something that carries a bit more risk than a traditional total market index fund.",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, \n\nI wanted to ask your expert opinion on the probability of Apple rising to $152 by Wednesday or Thursday of this week. I have some expiring options that I did not make a profit on as of right now (I would have had if I have sold them before the earnings). I am about to lose around 600-700 if I sell them at the current price. I only recently started doing some option trading and made around 1500 in total addition to equity. However, the decision to purchase Apple options ended up to be wrong as comparable Nvidia and AMD options at the time of my purchase budget have rose by at least 4-5 times in value. I learned a lot from this purchase, such as the need to diversify, and hoping that I can at least make some extra hundreds on this options and use my gained knowledge to continue my growth. \n\nFeel free to share your thoughts/ opinions. Any feedback or suggestions are welcomed.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 3, 2021**\n\nThe market continued its march higher, with all three major indexes remarkably posting fresh intraday highs. The market gapped up in the last few hours of the session after the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly monetary policy decision, which came in exactly how market participants wanted. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out in a big way today, finally breaking the $234.5 resistance it was battling with all year. Overall a great day for the markets. \n\nAs was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. \n\nThe Fed said in a statement, \u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nThe best part, and what propelled markets higher the last hour of market, was that the Fed\u2019s decision did not come with an updated timeline regarding the interest rate.\n\nStill, the persistently hotter-than-expected inflationary pressures in the recovering economy have put the Fed in a difficult spot when it comes to waiting on rate hikes, many economists argued. These elevated levels of inflation might push the Fed to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed, some maintained. And in the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, the central bank slightly updated its remarks on inflation, saying that \"Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory.\" In September, the Fed had said inflation was \"elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors.\" \n\nIn a later press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of current inflationary pressures, \u201cThe inflation that we\u2019re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It\u2019s due to bottlenecks and it\u2019s due to shortages and it\u2019s due to very strong demand meeting those. We don\u2019t see troubling increases in wages, and we don\u2019t expect those to emerge.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that there is further ground to cover in regards to maximum employment, one of the fundamental data points the Fed looks at when deciding policy. Powell said, \u201cIt is time to taper we think because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured for last December. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and terms of participation.\u201d\n\nOn a personal note, I want to say I commend the Fed for successfully avoiding another taper tantrum, like the one we saw in 2013 when the markets went into meltdown after the Fed announced they would begin to taper QE. In the end the fears were massively overblown. I saw a lot of fear mongering regarding tapering this time around glad that was avoided.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock was on the rise today again after Uber announced Tesla cars will be available to buy or lease as part of a green initiative for the ride-hailing company\n* Netflix (NFLX) announced that subscribers with Android phones or tablets can start playing mobile games on its app, an effort by the company to push into gaming.
