        "selftext": "Tech Cold War Not as Cold as one may infer.\n\nShort and sweet:\n\nTaiwan SemiConductors (TSMC) have an impressive Fab Plant which serves the worlds leading microchip designers.  They do business  in all parts of the globe, up until now.  TSMC are wise to the China debacle and are outright voicing that they are with U.S.  They will no longer be advancing any new contracts with Huawei.  This is an implicit move to show good faith to the FIVE EYES, bolstering an already tight pact with the United States.  This is a promise to all TSMCs' Clients that TSMC will protect the (expensive research &amp; development) designs via upholding customary Intellectual Property Rights.  \n\nTSMC has a leading edge on its' Samsung and ARM competitors. Their process for controlling the amount of un-wanted matter pervading the nanometer construction, is unparalleled as much as their ability to manufacture any design submitted.\n\nU.S. has reciprocated and has slated construction of a new Fabrication Plant, to be headed up by TSMC, to be built in Arizona.  \n\nThis is a BUY and HOLD.  TSMC will be at $200 April 2021\n\nAs is AMD, INTEL, Applied Materials (obviously NVDIA)\n\nP.S.\n\nIf you haven't seen the youtube inside TSMC, you should.  It's nearly totally automated.  Machines that cover an accumulative distance of 3X around the globe, everyday.\n\nYes, INTEL has On-Shore Fabrication Plants - But they are a ways from updating their processes to catch up to TSMC and it's an expensive overhaul not to mention some of the leaders who've made Intel what it is, have recently left.  I guess they figured Moore's law has ran its course",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 10th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets could be challenged by Washington stimulus talks and China tensions  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/markets-could-be-challenged-by-washington-stimulus-talks-and-china-tensions.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The debate in Washington over the next round of fiscal stimulus and rising tensions between the White House and China could act as brakes on the stock market in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks rallied in the past week but were more sluggish Friday, as investors watched stimulus talks between Democrats and the Trump administration stall out. Investors also were concerned that President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning U.S. transactions with Tencent\u2019s We Chat and Bytedance\u2019s Tik Tok would accelerate the deterioration of relations between the U.S. and China and draw retribution.\n*****\n&gt; Just ahead of Friday\u2019s market close, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said just that he is recommending the White House move forward with executive orders on unemployment, student loans and rental foreclosures. He said a compromise could not be reached with Democrats, who wanted a $2 trillion package. Stocks edged higher after the announcement though details of the orders and how any assistance could be funded were unclear.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to bring the Democrats back to the table to negotiate a deal by threatening to use an executive order. They may be able to get some things down, but it won\u2019t be enough to create the bridge they need while the economy continues to repair itself,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.4% for the week, ending at 3,351, after a 2 point gain Friday. The Nasdaq was down 0.9% Friday, ending at 11,010. It was up 2.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of the reason stocks have held in there well and continue to melt up is that one of the things that is priced in is a fifth fiscal policy package of $1.5 trillion. if we don\u2019t get one, I do think the market will retrace lower to reflect a lack of stimulus,\u201d said Arone. \u201cThe recovery will stall out without one.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for China, it has so far not taken actions against U.S. companies, even with the Trump administration\u2019s moves to block Chinese telecom giant Huawei from using U.S. parts. The latest steps, however, raised concerns that China could find ways to retaliate, and that the U.S. will bar Chinese IPOs.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn balance, continued hostility toward China is going to be a continued net negative for U.S. companies that are revenue exposed to China,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG. \u201cWe know the exposure is very centered in the Nasdaq names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the stock market is entering a seasonally weak time, and while market psychology is still strong it could start to change. \u201cThe seasonals are starting to shift negatively. We all know September is a poor month and the degree of the escalation of the tensions between the U.S. in China is not a surprise, but the degree of the escalation over the last 48 hours is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not changing psychology, but it\u2019s challenging bullish psychology.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, there are some final earnings of the season, including technology company Cisco and food company Sysco. Some travel companies including Royal Caribbean report, as does consumer goods company Tapestry. In the week after, big retailers roll out their reports in the final earnings burst of the quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Economic reports could be important in the coming week, as investors watch consumer price index inflation data Wednesday and retail sales Friday. Retail sales should provide a window into the consumer, as workers returned to their jobs but also faced uncertainty because of reclosings.\n*****\n&gt; CPI is important as the market has been assuming inflation will ultimately start to show gains because of the weakening dollar and ballooning budget deficits. CPI last month showed a 0.6% increase month over month.\n*****\n&gt; The pro-inflation trade has become important and has driven investors into stocks, gold, and out of the dollar.\n*****\n&gt; # Watch this trade\nThe dollar could be the key to the fate of markets in the coming week. The U.S. currency was edging higher Friday but is still down about 3.5% over the past four weeks. Gold declined Friday, and Treasury yields moved lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe dollar ... to me it just continues to be an important barometer that has a unique intersection of rates, inflation and risk assets,\u201d said Arone. \u201cWith rising China, U.S. tensions and combined with the fact that there\u2019s uncertainty about the fiscal policy package and the fact the dollar has declined so quickly, many are expecting it to catch a bid here and rebound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Part of the move in the dollar was based on the idea that huge government spending would increase the government\u2019s deficit and Treasury issuance. Emanuel said the news on stimulus could have a big impact on the trade.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe would make the argument the baseline expectation was a trillion dollars worth of stimulus to be implemented sometime in the month of August. Anything below that expectation is likely to cause the dollar to strengthen,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIt\u2019s a momentum and positioning trade as well as what has been ... the unwind of an asset diversification trade.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The stalling of talks could shift the market\u2019s view that the U.S. is willing to spend any amount to fight the impact of the coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s changing the market psychology that the government\u2019s propensity to spend infinitely is not as great as it was earlier in the week,,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cThe dollar rallying, from our perspective, is a direct threat to a lot of these momentum trades.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said a strengthening dollar could be a headwind for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGiven the friction with China, to the extent the inflation numbers come in weaker than expected, the argument being that whole weaker dollar asset diversification has helped feed into increasing inflation expectations,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cIf the inflation data does surprise to the downside, given the rally in inflation ...it\u2019s further potential for the unwinding of the short dollar trade and the unwinding of the long gold trade which in our view bleeds over into stocks.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Hd63ibb.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/JB5lwYJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/QGdJU9H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/wMC2Lp9B/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ohAnmHN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gbbisXK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IRn34qI.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1lbSlRY.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/v2nYSz6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C1gBrzCq/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/TYFPHKf3/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/KvRzNPXW/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/ryhsxhHW/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Individual Investors Still Don't Believe\n\n&gt; As mentioned in a prior post, in the past week the S&amp;P 500 has moved within 2% of its 2/19 high, but at the same time, less than a quarter of AAII respondents are optimistic for the future of stocks over the next six months. That begs the question- if there have been past times that sentiment and price action have been so detached from one another. Since the start of the AAII survey in 1987, there have been 10 periods (including the current one) in which the S&amp;P 500 was within 2% of an all-time high but bullish sentiment was less than 25% without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent prior occurrence was not even a full year ago. Back in October, sentiment was only slightly higher as the S&amp;P 500 was 1.84% from its all-time high. Prior to that, there were some scattered instances throughout 2013, 2015, and 2016 but before that, you would have to go back to 1993 to find another similar period. The one occurrence in 2013 stands out as it was both the lowest sentiment reading of these prior occurrences and the only one that occurred with the S&amp;P 500 right at an all-time high.\n\n&gt; As for where things stand after such instances, sentiment has tended to reverse higher in the following six months as the S&amp;P 500 has tended to move higher. The S&amp;P 500 has actually tended towards better than average returns over the next three months, although performance six months out has been modestly worse than average, even as it has been higher more often than not. Additionally, as shown in the second chart below, of the more recent occurrences of the past decade, they haven't marked any major top or bottom for the S&amp;P 500 with occurrences clustered both coming off of lows and in the middle of longer-term uptrends.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500-within-2-table.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-AAII-and-SP-500.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Silver Takes the Gold\n\n&gt; Gold and silver prices were already on a tear heading into this week, but they've only seen their gains accelerate even more. With more than a day and a half of trading left in the week, front-month gold futures have rallied, but silver has been the real show stopper with a gain of 16%!\n\n&gt; Taking a look at a one-year chart of silver over the last year, things have really gone parabolic this week as the front-month futures contract is trading more than 40% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and 62% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Silver.png))**\n\n&gt; Were it not for the move in silver, gold's move would be getting all the attention. Prices for gold have also seen a major surge in the last month, rising from under $1,800 to the current level of $2,060 per ounce. While not as extended as silver, gold currently trades 14% above its 50-DMA and 26% above its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold.png))**\n\n&gt; With gold 25.7% above its 200-DMA and silver 62.2% above, the average spread of the two commodities currently stands at 44.3%. In the 40+ year history of the two futures contracts, there have only been a handful of prior periods where the average spread of the two commodities was larger or even above 35% for that matter with the most recent occurring back in early 2011. This recent rally in the two commodities has certainly been one for the ages.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080620-Gold-Silver-Combined35.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Moves Off 52-Week Lows\n\n&gt; Within the US equity market, we've seen some major moves in individual stocks off their 52-week lows over the last few months. Look at the table below. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the performance of the largest companies in the US, stocks in the index are up an average of 87.6% from their respective 52-week lows. Looking at performance by individual sectors, stocks in the Energy sector are up an average of 136.8%, while the average Consumer Discretionary stock has rallied 131.4%. The Technology sector wasn't hit nearly as hard by the Covid-crash as other sectors, but stocks in the sector have doubled on an average basis relative to their 52-week lows. The only sector where stocks are up less than 50% on an average basis from their 52-week lows is Utilities at 46.33%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low.png))**\n\n&gt; For many investors, the holy grail of stock picking is the proverbial ten-bagger. A ten-bagger is a stock that multiplies by ten times its original price. Usually, this happens over the span of years, but in the Covid-economy, we've actually seen a number of these ten-baggers play out in the span of months. While most of these examples are in the small-cap space, shares of Wayfair (W), which has a current market cap of $27.5 billion, have rallied from $21.70 on March 19th to its current price of $290.85 now. That's a gain of more than 1,200% in less than five months!\n\n&gt; Within the entire Russell 1,000, 257 stocks have at least doubled off their 52-week lows, and in the table below we highlight the 34 stocks that are at least a quarter of the way to the ten-bagger club and have rallied more than 250%. As mentioned above, W tops the list, but Fastly (FSLY), which has barely been public for a year, is just shy of the club with a gain of 992%. Behind FSLY, Livongo Health (LVGO) is up 855%. Given that LVGO just got a takeover offer from Teladoc (TDOC), the 11th best-performing stock on the list, it may only make the ten-bagger club under the banner of the TDOC ticker.\n\n&gt; In looking through the list of stocks shown, many of these names come from the Health Care, Technology, and Consumer Discretionary sectors and have been direct beneficiaries of the new Covid-economy. At the same time, six stocks from the Energy sector made the list as well as they recovered from their bombed-out levels after oil prices briefly traded in negative territory earlier this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/080520-Rusell-1000-change-from-52-week-low-table-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Labor Market Continues Summer Momentum\n\n&gt; After falling the most on record in April, the US labor market has rebounded with three consecutive months of job gains, adding back more than 9 million of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April. In July, the economy added back nearly 1.8 million jobs, ahead of Bloomberg consensus estimates for 1.5 million and lowering the unemployment rate from 11.1% to 10.2%, but lingering measurement issues could add 1% to that number, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, job gains were broad based across industries, with a third of the increase coming from the leisure and hospitality sector\u2014the \u201cscene of the accident\u201d industries\u2014while only information, and mining and logging posted declines in July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMarch and April were historically brutal months for the labor market, but the labor market\u2019s resiliency this summer has been a welcome development,\u201d stated LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, the next few months will be critical for the economy as schools reopen and additional fiscal stimulus still hangs in the balance.\u201d\n\n&gt; The July report also comes on the heels of a rise in COVID-19 cases across the Sunbelt region of the United States. Because of the date of the survey, it may not fully reflect the economic impact of some of the more recent high-frequency data that has captured some of the effect of rising cases. Still, the jobs report shows that the US economy is continuing to heal despite the long road ahead.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Are Recessions Good For Stocks?\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t like any recession we\u2019ve ever seen, as it was sparked by a horrible pandemic and happened because people were told to stay inside. The impact was the worst contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) last quarter that anyone who is reading this has ever seen. But what is quite surprising is the fact the Nasdaq has made 30 all-time highs so far in 2020, while the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained four consecutive months, all while the unemployment rate remains above 10%.\n\n&gt; Why is this happening? There are two main schools of thought. One is that stocks are forecasting a better economy later this year and into 2021; remember, stocks tend to lead the economy and could be doing so once again. Another school of thought is that the massive fiscal and monetary policy are boosting equity prices, while not helping the overall economy quite as much.\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the catch. It actually isn\u2019t abnormal to see stocks gain during a recession. \u201cThis is one that might surprise many people, but stocks have actually gained during 7 of the past 12 recessions,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThere\u2019s no question the difference between what is happening on Wall Street compared with Main Street is about as wide as we\u2019ve ever seen, but maybe it shouldn\u2019t be as big of a surprise that stocks have been strong.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 actually gained 1.3% on average when looking at the 12 previous recessions going back to World War II, with a very impressive median advance of 5.7% (the average is skewed lower due to 2008). We continue to expect this recession to end soon, if it isn\u2019t over already. In fact, when the end of the recession is officially declared at a later date, we could have yet another recession that saw stock market gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.5.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$MELI** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$WKHS** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$RCL** \n&gt; * **$DKNG** \n&gt; * **$MAR** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$MARK** \n&gt; * **$PRTK** \n&gt; * **$JMIA** \n&gt; * **$DUK** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$ON** \n&gt; * **$HUYA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$SEAS** \n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$PRPL** \n&gt; * **$LYFT** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FOLD** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$DOYU** \n&gt; * **$SYY** \n&gt; * **$SDGR** \n&gt; * **$GOOS** \n&gt; * **$TTOO** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$NBEV** \n&gt; * **$GRWG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/v2nYSz6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mjhw2qX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, AUGUST 10TH, 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/NHhXB13.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/H67Mg1J.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5DIQO1B.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RgQdixH.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdVRiJu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tuCqkCk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RqbAmnt.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pZjdCyt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ni20iSQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DgPcij6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/LcirLAw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.14.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NIO Inc. $13.42\n&gt; **NIO Inc.

The Price Nosedives from $67 to the $30s. Leaving me holding the bag. Well today almost 6 months later I can say I'm no longer holding that bag. Hallelujah! Hell I might have even made a few pennies as the price is around $67.50. But the point is buy low and sell high. And if you can wait it out a good stock will recover usually. Now I probably could have just taken the 50% loss and reinvested it elsewhere and got it back quicker, but damn it feels good waiting it out when you finally turn green on a stock. So what's the correct move guys?\nA. Take the loss and invest elsewhere.\nB. Wait it out till even.\nC. Keep adding to the losing position.\nD. Don't ever sell, Stay Long.",

LYFT reported yesterday and the stock was down from a high of $31.62 to close today $28.83 -1.64 (5.37%) and UBER, which has fallen from a high of $34.79 a week ago to close the day today $30.46 -.38 (1.23%) but down 12% for the week.\nAs mentioned before, CSCO reported a poor showing and last night it was $44.47, but it continued today and finished $42.72 -5.38 (11.2%).  AMAT beat on revenues and earnings and gave solid guidance and after closing $65.07 \u2013 1.43 it reversed higher and is $67.37 +2.30, and BIDU beat on earnings but with only in-line revenues and gave a warning about ad revenues in the coming quarter.  It closed $124.57 -1.54 (1.22%) but is now trading $115.32 -9.25 (7.25%).\nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN -1.11, BGS -.06, FLO -.14, CPB +.22, CAG -.14, MDLZ -.02, KHC +.22, CALM Unchanged, JJSF -.28, SAFM -1.14, HRL +.09, PPC +.07, SJM +.57, KR +.16, and PBJ $33.94 +.05 (.15%).\n \nBIOPHARMA was LOWER with BIIB -4.72, ABBV -.51, REGN -1.46, ISRG +7.47, GILD -.61, MYL +.02, TEVA -.07, VRTX -3.70, BHC -.20, INCY +1.38, LABU +2.32, and IBB $134.11 +.30 (.22%).\nCANNABIS: was MIXED with TLRY +.21, CGC +.08, CRON -.01, GWPH -.52, ACB +.45, NBEV +.08, CURLF -.10, KERN -.22, and MJ $13.07 +.29 (2.27%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -3.20, GD -.10, TXT -.80, NOC -.78, BWXT -.40, TDY +.35, RTX -.29, and ITA $169.95 -.97 (.57%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was MIXED with M -.03, JWN +.40, KSS -.18, DDS +.21, WMT +.55, TGT +.49, TJX -.52, RL +.32, UAA -.17, LULU +4.96, TPR -.09, CPRI -.30, and XRT $51.23 +.17 (.33%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +10.75, AMZN +4.26, AAPL +7.86, FB +2.62, NFLX +6.53, NVDA +1.59, TSLA +80.24, BABA -2.36, BIDU -10.28, CMG +37.02, BA -.14, CAT -1.57, DIS -.70, and XLK $113.96 +.05 (.04%).\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE PRICES ARE LATE MARKET QUOTES AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE 4:00 CLOSES.\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -3.33, JPM -.39, BAC -.33, MS -.17, C -.30, PNC -.99, AIG -.23, TRV +.41, AXP -1.14, V -.44, and XLF $25.08 -.16 (.63%).\n \nOIL, $42.24 -.43. Oil was higher in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning on news of production cutbacks from Iraq. The stocks were LOWER with XLE $37.83 -.75 (1.94%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,970.40 +21.40 was a dramatic sell-off taking the gold down as low as $1,874.00 before a rally back to $1,975.  While I like the gold down here, I will have to see how it trades for a day or two.  I am still a bull on the metal.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $11,590 -75. After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a \u201crunning correction\u201d pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $12220 yesterday. We had added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97, but sold 250 shares today @ $13.93. GBTC closed $13.09 -.02 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "ONTO &gt; AMAT, here\u2019s why. ONTO has a technological edge with their equipment and are way under valued. They are taking at about 21 P/E right now, but as they build out their portfolio, they expect to earn over $5/sh with increased margins. So, a FPE of closer to 7. AMAT is a great company, but they are already built out. ONTO has that TAM SAM gap to fill in addition to eating market share and the growing industry. I wouldn't be shocked if AMAT or LRCX buys ONTO, frankly. It would make sense.\n\nThey have Advanced node and advanced packaging. As customers move toward 3nm 6th gen dual layer, they need Atlas III. And with pattern control software with machine learning, they provide an end to end solution. So if Intel or Western Digital want to survive in their competitive marketplaces, they need to have the best tools to print the wafers. They are a small company, but they are #1 or #2 in their core markets. They win because they have the best tools.",

        "selftext": "I firmly expect $OSS to run up into earnings this Thursday and potentially beyond, and I have statistics + leaks from AMD/NVIDIA to back this up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you review their [partnerships](https://www.onestopsystems.com/partners) and [financial statements](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001564590-20-013196/0001564590-20-013196.pdf), you start to wonder if their stock price is some kind of joke. They are very clearly doing much better than 95% of the pennystocks mentioned on this subreddit and have an array of high-level connections in their industry. In short, they're not struggling.\n\nNVIDIA cites them as a \"[top system maker](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/22/2050975/0/en/World-s-Top-System-Makers-Unveil-NVIDIA-A100-Powered-Servers-to-Accelerate-AI-Data-Science-and-Scientific-Computing.html)\" and are officially one of NVIDIA's [Preferred Manufacturers](https://www.onestopsystems.com/nvidia-gpus).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's rare for a company this young to perform at such a high level. By their SECOND YEAR, they generated $60 million in revenue (57% increase YoY) and already had multiple profitable quarters, which is unheard of. For comparison, they make 60x as much as GNUS, but get 1/60th of the attention. This means we get to be early.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Three Catalysts - Pick your Weapon:\n\n1. Q2 earnings this Thursday, August 6th - Their past earnings have been very very strong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Upcoming Siggraph 2020 tech conference (August 17-24) - A showcase of new military-grade Nvidia workstations/datacenters and Nvme PCIe storage/flash products)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Caught in the middle of a dick-measuring contest between AMD/NVIDIA, who both have new GPU architectures coming out (partnered with both). This is a situation that's going to unfold over time. As an OEM for both companies who are targeting PCIe 4.0 systems, OSS is going to be very pleased.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PROMISED LEAKS:**\n\nOSS currently holds the [first and only PCIe 4.0 server expansion system](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/press-releases/detail/164/oss-introduces-worlds-first-pcie-gen-4-expansion-system) that's compatible with Nvidia's A-100 card, the [most powerful processor in the world](https://www.techpowerup.com/270338/nvidia-ampere-a100-gpu-gets-benchmark-and-takes-the-crown-of-the-fastest-gpu-in-the-world). (benchmarked last week. Highest Octanebench score ever recorded.)\n\nThe CEO hinted that AMD's MI100 would be soon to follow, as [leaks from AMD](https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-cdna-and-mi100-presentation-slides-leak/) are showing specs and the clear intention to target PCIe 4.0 server systems, which OSS currently holds the majority of the market share in.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI could write a novel on this company, but I'm not going to bother. They will do well whether we talk about them or not.\n\nThey recently hired a new CEO, who's led two companies in the same industry to record revenues and one was bought out entirely by Broadcom. He also receives a [massive salary bonus](https://imgur.com/MPDnP9c) if the stock price reaches $5.50. It's clear what their intentions are.\n\nThe CEO did an interview yesterday where he mentioned that they had \"0 Covid cases on the production line\", which further bolsters my firm prediction that their quarterly/annual earnings should be very strong.",

        "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been riding AMD\u2019s cock since late June and have made some great returns, especially in the past two weeks. That being said, today I sold my remaining call contracts on the stock. No, not because I think AMD is going to drop (although it will have price pullback all the way down to $77)- but because I think there\u2019s an opportunity that many investors (including you autists and bag holders) are overlooking.\n\nINTC took a massive hit the last two weeks (-$13.42 between 07/20-07/31) , following a pump on AMD after their Q2 earnings beat, with the additional help of many news outlets covering the AMD versus INTC battle. In the midst of all of this, INTC decides to let everyone know that they will not be manufacturing chips anymore- which sealed the deal on AMD being a dominant force in the chip manufacturing industry. \n\nI see a lot of people, especially on this retarded reddit page full of blind option traders (with the exception of the 10% who know what they are doing) talk about how \u201cINTC is going to drop all the way down to $32\u201d... \n\n\n\n- Here is what you need to understand about Intel -\n\nSince 2014, Intel\u2019s revenue in the Client Computing Group (chip manufacturing) has dropped almost 7% in 6 years. You cannot let this news regarding Intel\u2019s switch in corporate direction give jurisdiction on whether you think the corporation will be of any value a year from now. It is obvious that Intel has been slowing the production of their chips for atleast two years now, and they have slowly been shifting in a different direction because of an increase in revenue provided from the data sector.\n\n\n\nSo what does this all mean?\n\nThe fact that Intel has cut the manufacturing of chips is actually a good thing for the corporation, whether you think so or not. It has been a slowly-decaying revenue stream for years, and the money can be implemented in other sectors in which Intel has seen yearly-growth in revenue.\n\nI know, it\u2019s hard. Intel isn\u2019t making chips, doesn\u2019t make sense right? Yea it kind of doesn\u2019t make sense. BUT, in a broader scheme of things, it does. They have been getting killed by their competitors for years, so the move seems appropriate.\n\n\n\nINTC STOCK\n\nThe only times INTC stock has dropped below $50, in the past 3 years, were for the following reasons:\n\nAugust to February 2018- Intel suffers scrutiny for announcing that they are shifting their focus away from chip making and towards A.I., memory solutions, cloud computing, and IoT.\n\nJuly to August 2019- News articles released regarding AMD\u2019s new Ryzen chips and their comparison to Intel.\n\nMarch 2020- Do i really need to explain this drop\n\n\n\nConsensus\n\nINTC has been hinting for YEARS that they are leaving the chip manufacturing sector and turning towards other profitable ones. Their latests announcement shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but if you are someone who hasn\u2019t followed them for years- then it may seem like one.\n\n\n\nThe reason you are reading this\n\nINTC 60C - exp 01/15/21 \nThese \u201crelatively small\u201d leap contracts are sold for pennies on the fucking dollar right now. If you read what I just wrote, which I\u2019m sure most of you won\u2019t- then you would understand that this move has a lot potential. Right now, INTC isn\u2019t gonna drop any more. If it goes below $40, then maybe I\u2019m wrong.\n\nBut I\u2019m never wrong.\n\n\n\nAmd to the moon, but lets not be retarded on how we value a major corporation like this. I mean cmon. LOL",

        "selftext": "In a recent post I did on AMD, some had expressed interest in a write-up on Cloudflare. I wasn\u2019t going to write anything since I am long NET, but then I saw Fastly up around 13% today ahead of its earnings on Wednesday. With both Cloudflare and Fastly reporting this week, I thought the timing was apt to compare these two as they\u2019ve pursued different approaches to building their networks. And I happen to believe that while Fastly\u2019s heavy focus on speed/performance does offer some advantages in the CDN market, the real opportunity in these names (as well as Akamai for that matter) is the edge computing market \u2013 not CDN.\n\nI think one of the major reasons why Fastly is up over 430% YTD and Cloudflare over 145% is because most analysts were slow to pick up on the full extent of the end market(s) these companies are exposed to. I also think there has been some conflation in terms of the technology. Even now, I see CDN and edge computing used interchangeably when they are not necessarily the same. While similar ideas in that they both leverage edge servers (servers placed at a closer geographical proximity to the end-user or device), the use-case is not necessarily the same. Think of a CDN more so as a particular application or use of edge computing. To this point, multiple CDN players (Akamai, LimeLight, CDNetworks) have made recent moves into the broader edge computing market. \n\nBroader is the keyword here, because whereas CDNs cache web content (videos, photos, etc. from a website to speed its \u201cdelivery\u201d to the site\u2019s visitor), the hype surrounding edge computing is more so tied to 5G and the Internet-of-Things rather than primarily websites or SaaS applications necessarily. To be more specific, the value proposition of IoT is the vast distribution of sensors and real-time *collection* of data. Positioning edge networks closer to the IoT devices can enable faster industrial or logistics solutions.\n\nThose familiar with Fastly will be aware that they offer (or offered) the fastest cold start times (this just means the time it takes for an application to start up and be responsive to user input) of any serverless network application (CDN or edge) at 35 microseconds. Fastly claims that they are the gold standard for speed and performance and superior to AWS, Azure, Google, and Cloudflare. This approach has been successful, especially in targeting large enterprise customers. Fastly has a much larger average customer size relative to Cloudflare. \n\nWhile Fastly has recently expanded their security offerings as they further develop their edge platform, Cloudflare's strategy from the onset has been to balance performance, speed, and flexibility. Why does this matter? The major drawback to edge computing is that it greatly increases attack vectors for network intrusion. 5G will enable an extremely rapid proliferation of IoT devices. According to the Telecommunications Industry Association, by 2022, more than half of all internet-connected devices will by IoT machines. And IoT device operators will absolutely prioritize security of their industrial and logistics applications, especially as most computing applications (websites, programs, etc.), are not really as sensitive to latency at the speeds we are talking \u2013 i.e. the user/operator can\u2019t actually discern the speed difference on their end. \n\nIoT operators (industrial, logistics, transportation companies) won\u2019t be focused on consumers doing e-commerce or going on Reddit. They will be collecting zettabytes of structured and unstructured data to *push upstream* so that they can manage their assets more efficiently and securely. Fastly\u2019s network utilizes fewer servers to increase efficiency and speed. Although that is great for Twitter, this lowers the network capacity to mitigate DDoS attacks (the most common IoT attack). Cloudflare has more points-of-presence and network capacity versus Fastly. This combined with their more expansive attack logs (Cloudflare services a far greater number of web properties than Fastly) and more mature security product portfolio, gives their network architecture numerous advantages for the edge computing market. This is all ignoring the fact that Cloudflare announced last week *zero nanosecond* cold start times for its edge computing platform which totally undercuts the Fastly speed advantage anyway. \n\nThe CDN market is larger today. Prior to COVID and the work-from-home demand boost, estimates tagged it at around $13.3bn. In comparison, the edge computing market was only $3.5bn in 2019 according to Grand View Research. Looking towards the future though? The CDN market is forecasted to hit $23bn plus by 2025, while the edge computing market is seen hitting $43bn or more in 2027. There have been recent reports that suggest the rise in the edge computing market over the next 10 years could even rival the growth in public cloud over the previous ten years (led by Amazon, Microsoft, Google). And Gartner believes that by 2025, three-quarters of enterprise-generated data will be created and processed at the edge. If you stop and think how much data has been created in 2020 versus just a few years ago, that is truly staggering growth. \n\nThe above comments gloss over the fact that there are also some very real reasons why a CTO or purchaser would select Cloudflare as a CDN over Fastly. The other big advantage Fastly has over Cloudflare (and Akamai) is it is *much* more customizable for developers. For web applications that are very high-level enterprise grade or extremely sensitive to latency, it absolutely makes sense to go with Fastly. However not all use-cases for a CDN require that level of customization, and there is quite the vertical learning curve for developers to learn the Fastly platform. Cloudflare also has more flexible pricing tiers (including a free tier) for customers who may not need the premium features. In short, there is a much wider range of use-cases that Cloudflare can cater to with its CDN platform relative to Fastly. I think this is evidenced by the fact that Cloudflare has far more customers (number not size) in addition to a much bigger developer community on Stackflow. \n\nThis all gives Cloudflare more potential to scale with its CDN customers and cross-sell its more diverse product portfolio. Again, Fastly certainly has a very strong presence in the large enterprise market. And for many, the performance and customization offered by Fastly will be a decisive factor when it comes to which CDN provider to choose. But I do think that Fastly has very much built itself to be the premium provider when a lot of customers are totally happy with a marginally slower cold start time if it means more flexibility on cost or ease-of-use.\n\nAt the end of the day, what this boils down to is which end market are you more bullish on: CDN or edge computing. For the record, I think over the next five years Fastly has a great opportunity to keep up the momentum. Its performance YTD would scare me a little bit in the immediate term because I think these levels assume continued growth acceleration or more guidance raises. But the CDN market is projected to keep growing at a healthy clip. And like I said, there are definitely some clear use cases for Fastly. \n\nI just happen to think that Cloudflare has a much, much, much higher long-term ceiling (thinking next 10-15 years) when you look at its natural advantages in the edge computing space and the enormous potential of that end market. Also of note, Cloudflare is slated to nearly double its global data center footprint over the next 3 years through its joint venture in China with JD.com. And whatever you think of China, its undeniable that there will be a data explosion there as internet penetration goes from the low 60% it is today to someday rival western countries. \n\nFastly is interesting, but when you look at the fact that Cloudflare has 77% gross margins compared to 57% for Fastly, you are ultimately paying a higher EV/revenue for slower growth, fewer revenues, one-fifth the cash, and significantly weaker margins. Good luck to all!",

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

        "selftext": " I\u2019ve been bullish on precious metals since late 2019 and covid has nothing to do with it. Lately, gold became the new meme play just like TSLA, AMD, PRPL, tankers etc. Seeing the amount of posts on gold lately even made me cautious, not gonna lie. But then I remembered that government actions will still outweigh us autists in any bubbly thing we do.  \n\nPosted a little [write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqzije/gold_mines_w_positions_and_plays/) on gold mines in May, because people were missing out on them. Now it seems that a lot of fresh blood enters precious metals ETF\u2019s but without necessarily understanding details on them. So today's post is for newbies, to guide them to the shining tendies.   \n   \n Note: I will not cover up-the-ass-leveraged funds and royalty trusts since I reckon you\u2019ll be able to lose all your money even without my help.  \n\nHere is a chart of ETFs arranged by their risk factor (risk increases to the right): \n\n# AAAU &gt; OUNZ &gt; GLD &gt; GDX &gt; GDXJ &gt; PPLT &gt; SLV &gt; SIL &gt; SILJ  \n\nRisk increase usually means more gains and loses, but that is not always the case. Also, some of these ETFs can be replaced with similar products (examples will be provided)  \n\n**AAAU** \u2013 redeemable physical gold ETF backed by the government of West Australia. This is the only gold ETF in the world that I know of, that is guaranteed by any government. What does redeemable mean? Say, you get caught on insider trading and you plan to move to the jungles of Cambodia. Since your bank accounts are about to get blocked on your way to Cambodia you park your boat in Perth, Australia, and exchange your AAAU shares on actual physical gold coins and bars. You can even buy it with kangaroo depicted, if you are kang-gang.   \n\nOptions are not available, basically treat this ETF as the best substitute of cash.\n\n**OUNZ** \u2013 redeemable physical gold ETF backed by VanEck, one of the largest American investment management companies. So, basically as good as non-backed at all.  \n\nOptions are scarce.  \n\n**Alternative products**: CEF.  \n\n**GLD** \u2013 you all know this one. Biggest in the world. It is kinda physical, but no one ever seen that physical gold. Ran by a chain of subsidiaries of State Street Corporation. SSC, Vanguards, BlackRocks and others, are basically the ones who control the entire economy. Funny thing is that only The Trust\u2019s Authorized Participants can check or redeem physical gold from GLD ETF. Which basically means that only homies and cronies can tell if it\u2019s there. This fact among others makes some investors to doubt if there even is enough of physical in their vaults, or is it IOUs only. That\u2019s why I put in on 3 place.\n\nOptions are numerous for GLD.  \n\n**Alternative products**: IAU, 4GLD, IGLN, PHAU, GBS and many others.  \n\n**GDX** \u2013 here we come to the mining ETFs. Maybe your paranoia starts digging in your brain about what if there\u2019s no physical in the vaults. Maybe you\u2019ve listened lately to a short Peter Schiff rant for about 7 hours. Maybe you just want bigger gains on gold moves. GDX offers exposure to senior miners. Some people believe that \u2018senior miners\u2019 means that those mines will be in good jurisdictions where people tend to eat each other on a less regular basis. This couldn\u2019t be further from truth. Senior miners are only the miners with the biggest market cap. Newmonts, Barricks, RioTintos, Franco-Nevadas, AngloAmericans \u2013 that kind of companies. And many of them actually have mines in extremely risky jurisdictions, but this is offset by the mere mass of those companies.  \n\nOptions aren\u2019t as numerous as for GLD, but still more then enough to play.  \n\n**Alternative products**: RING, SGDM (Sprott and the company are probably the cleverest guys in the field), GOAU, EPGFX (yep, Peter Schiffs ETF. Memes aside \u2013 good performance).  \n\n**GDXJ** \u2013 basically explained above. Small cap miners. It is usually under 10 bil. companies. From my observations, junior miners go UP or DOWN 20% more than seniors on gold moves. This is rather accurate on a longer term, not necessarily on a daily basis. \n\n**Alternative products**: SGDJ.  \n\n**PPLT** \u2013 we finally left the realm of gold and we find ourselves in platinum. I admit, I don\u2019t know much about it, but it is more volatile than gold and less volatile than silver. ETFs on platinum are very rare, and PPLT is the only one with a significant market cap.  \n\nOptions are not available.  \n\n**Alternative products**: PLTM, but it dwarfs in comparison.  \n\nSLV \u2013 poor people\u2019s gold, as they say. Silver moves after gold, but usually makes bigger moves. SLV is run by BlackRock, same as IAU. It tracks silver futures prices.  \n\nOptions are numerous.  \n\n**Alternative products**: SIVR, DBS. Avoid leveraged commodities like AGQ. And by God don\u2019t be stupid to buy ZSL thinking that it\u2019s a silver ETF: it is shorting silver, not longing.  \n\n**SIL** \u2013 major silver miners ETF. Similar relation to SLV as GDX to GLD. Offers bigger moves on silver price.\n\nOptions are available.  \n\n**Alternative products**: SLVP.  \n\n**SILJ** \u2013 junior miners of silver ETF. They are heavily exposed to big miners as well (Pan American Silver Corp, Hecla Mining, etc) but the majority of the fund is allocated in small cap companies.  \n\nDespite similar names SILJ is run by other company than SIL. Later is ran by Global X, mostly owned by Koreans, I believe. While SIL is two years younger and is managed by ETFMG.  \n\nFrom my observations SILJ doesn\u2019t offer that much of a difference in moves compared to SIL. Not as much as GDXJ to GDX, but still it is generally more volatile. And costs less.  \n\nOptions are available but spreads are rather bad.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[Reading on the internet is hard, so if you've made it so far \u2013 take a rest and enjoy this picture of a golden frog statue from Pre-Columbian Columbia. Don't you just love how 'Pre-Coumbian Columbia' sounds? ](https://preview.redd.it/1z53iwebgdf51.jpg?width=735&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b4a68d973dd11922b193a32bc01ba48177b4210)\n\nWe went from the most safe and stable precious metal ETF to the most volatile.  \n\nFew more observations that you might find useful: \n\n\\- Sometimes mining ETFs fall while the price of the underlining metal futures rise. This is often bound to the general stock market performance. Miners are still viewed as stocks and if S&amp;P falls \u2013 they sometimes fall too because A) people are stupid; B) some of the bigger index funds and asset management firms are also exposed to mining stocks. But it\u2019s mostly A.\n\nSuch days are the best moments to enter.  \n\n\\- Precious metals are viewed as a hedge against volatility and market crashes. That is not correct. Metals as investment are first and foremost hedge against weak currency and inflation. Want to know what awaits gold - Dollar index (DXY) is much more indicative than VIX.\n\n\\- How long will the bull run last? No one knows for sure. My crystal ~~meth~~ ball says that it will go on at list until elections. Likely after them too, especially if Biden wins (don\u2019t care about your political affiliations, but Biden will increase money printing for sure: he promises to expand the budget  even more and no tax increase can cover it). It is wise to combine short expiring options on metal ETFs with long expiring ones (March 2021+ long).  \n\n\\- I can not make any post without shiting on the FED, so here it goes: global OZ price was \\~19 USD from XVIII century up until 1920s. From then on the US dollar lost staggering 99% of it\u2019s value compared to gold. Source: Timothy Green's Historical Gold Price Table.\n\nThis whole gold move leaves me with bittersweet taste: I gained a lot but those gains come from destruction of everything I hold dear (in economical sense).  \n\nBut let\u2019s not get too philosophical here. Hope this post helps those who want to enter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**: play with GLD if small pp, play with GDXJ and SILJ if big pp.  \n\nDisclaimer: this is not a financial advise and anime cat girls are overrated.",

        "selftext": "# Happy Saturday r/wallstreetbets\n\n**Introduction**: This is my first options trade. I know that none of you know who I am here yet, but you can check my post history if you need to see credentials. I started trading with my friend from gifted class back in the day and we found PPL due to my pennystocks screener that i expanded the price parameters on. My friend is very talented at fundamental analysis, so we'll start with him first. I also want to say thank you to this sub, I have learned how to trade options in about a month, and I appreciate all of you autistic traders who have helped me out. Some of you have recognized me in the webull comments of the S&amp;P500 as I've started trading those weeklies. I use an algorithmic prediction based on 140,000+ analysts filtered through machine learning. But I might start making posts on Sunday Evenings for that soon, after i have proof of its efficacy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I assume no responsibility if this becomes a losing trade, and you agree to hold harmless if you decide to take any trades based off of any info contained within this post. These are not recommendations to buy or sell anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PPL DD from the bro \n\nIm still looking at PPL, but so far: Gas and Electric utility company (like \\[ \\] for us) with 10 million customers and 7B+ in revenue. Quick reference, \\[ \\] is at \\~$32/share with 300mil in income. PPL is $26 with 500mil in income.  \nThey have **9 seperate filings of insider buys** on *July 2nd*. Also on *April 3rd*, *Feb 18th*, *Jan 18th* and *Jan 2nd*. I havent yet verified if they were all the same people every time. Again, still looking.  \nThey promoted a new President in the last couple months, amd the outgoing President ALSO placed an insider buy on his way out.  \nFinancials look good. They have plenty of capital, were barely affected by coronavirus from what it looks like, but that will be confirmed on Aug 10th, when they report 2nd Q earnings.  \nOverall it looks strong. Looks weird to most the fundamental research ive done because of the amount of insider buys. It looks like they had some small share dilution since 2q 2019 but I havent found it yet. Suffice to say it wasnt much, as it only dropped earnings/share a couple pennies Q over Q. Im not sure what to make of it other than the company's executives are buying more and more at every opportunity, their share price is less than \\[ \\]'s, while all financial indicators say it should be higher. Even pre-covid levels are lower than \\[ \\]'s pre-covid levels.  \nIt is a utility company, so they arent known for volatility in share price. It did jump up to $30 briefly in June. It was on a nice rise before the covid collapse\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to me, trevandezz. They also have earnings August 10. Someone told me one time that when analysts raise their price targets before earnings, its a good sign. Idk how valid it is lol, but I saw this on the News tab of Webull. If you can explain the other stuff in here please do:  [https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ppl-a-buy-or-sell-right-now/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ppl-a-buy-or-sell-right-now/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How to Trade These Options\n\nPlease understand that I started learning how to trade options about a month ago, if I have screwed up any info, let me know. This is the part, where if you can't read charts you're gonna have a bad time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Firstly, here is a key for my charts*\n\n[Also, red candles are bearish, white are bullish](https://preview.redd.it/lw1cfbgbobe51.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcea744bf8a5a2406ad598629beacf2734201e36)\n\nHere is the monthly chart for PPL. The end of the month is always a great time to check the monthly chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dq992a1qbe51.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9236cec3dd70cb980c29a4f79ed37c45dba6eb78\n\nFrom the Monthly chart, it looks like the bearish trend has reversed, as the June candle didn't engulf the previous candle, and July just completed a bullish hammer reversal candle. When we use the fibonacci tool to measure this current bullish trend, we can see that this retracement dipped into the 50% fib area (pink box), which is cool for me. The 127 fibonacci extension gives us a monthly (long term) target of $33.58, which is also confluence with weekly resistance in that area. And honestly that seems like a better valuation of this company. The price was actually at $36 in January before the beer flu hit. Do with that info what you will \n\n# As we zoom into the weekly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u04dmef1sbe51.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7ed380244876e84428f6f1302bda78e4a99989c\n\nThe weekly chart has broken out of this range that it's been trading in. Great sign. The daily chart is basically the same info, if it can break through this next resistance, our short term target is $27.20\n\nNow, on to the options.\n\nI don't know how you bros do it, but I always just assume the contract will expire worthless and use that as my risk for the trade. You only want to lose $5,000 on this trade if we're wrong? Buy qty 75: 27c 8/21 [Options Profit Calculator](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html)\n\nThe price has to drop $3.67 for these contracts to be worthless next week before earnings. If the price moves in the upwards direction $3.67, your contracts are worth $18,000. If the price hits our final target of $33.58, you'll have $43,875. To me, I think we could hit $30.79 this upcoming week. Previous weeks have spiked in that same percentage, putting those contracts value at $25,200.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe IV charts look dope too, it's below the 252MA which is a buy sign to me. You never want to buy options when IV is over extended, pretty sure that's how people get IV crushed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1c3dg2zwbe51.png?width=1451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebc1111b5a5c7906101478718aaa2285714bb46f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheta is literally $1.50 per day on each contract. Delta is $33, which is good right? Heres the option chart. Notice how these contracts hold their value quite perfectly til expiration. Hitting our target at $33.58 is a $43,000 profit. YUH\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwgsthg9xbe51.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b220ce8a9a8c641e6d8f58a46735cc4130f4990c\n\nCheers bois",

        "selftext": "Listen up fuckers.\n\n\nI\u2019m not ludicrously experienced with options, but I can recognize some bullshit when I see it. This arcticle [(Intel \u2018Stunning Failure\u2019 Heralds End of an Era for U.S. Chip Sector)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html) and a bunch of other \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b news caused $INTC to drop off the face of the earth last week. \n\n\nI kinda fail to see the drama. Intel has always outsourced it's chips. Maybe it's doing it more now, but even 8 years ago when my brother and I built our first PC's. His chip was from Mexico, mine was from Taiwan. \n\n\nFurthermore, TSMC, the company this article says Intel should sell factories to, has been the heavyweight chip maker for a decade or more.\n\n\nNvidia and AMD for example, they are the two graphics card manufacturers. BOTH of them have their chips made by TSMC. These companies do all their designing, but in the end everything is made by TSMC anyway. At least, a lions share of it.\n\n\nNow, Intel definitely has struggled in the recent market, but that's because they've demolished AMD in the performance chip market for nearly two decades. There was no reason to keep pushing their envelope, spending billions on R&amp;D for a better product. All they had to do was refine their Lake series processors and they'd continue to rake in a ton of profit. This profit was used to expand their market to the mobile industry. Particularly laptops. For a long time it was hard to get an apple product with any kind of processor that wasn't Intel.\n\n\nThey're not going away. They're not crashing.\n\n\nThey're just finally seeing AMD pass them in one market. This has caused other markets to start to shift due to uncertainty about who the \"best\" chip manufacturer is, but trust me - we will see Intel back with a fiery vengeance.\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Intel pops out some high core count chips that are pushing 5.0-5.5 all core clock count speeds. Once they scale down their transistor size... Oof. It's going to be a Rottweiler back in the pit. \n\n\n\nTL;DR INTC $55c 09/18, but load up on whatever the hell you want, these contracts are CHEAP",

        "selftext": "Apparently he bought the dip with an average price of $50/share, which makes today price look like a good deal. This makes me wonder if he believes that Intel will recover from its infamous 7nm delay announcement. It\u2019s almost like he wants to get the worst news out first, and any good news after that will sound like a great news. There will be a presentation in Aug 13 by Intel chief architect about its new Tiger Lake, which is said to be launch in Sep 2. And it is said that they plan to ramp up production of Tiger Lake by 40% more than previously intended. It sounds to me that Intel is betting big on Tiger Lake. Based on recent benchmark, Intel i7-1165G7 10nm CPU is 20-35% faster than AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 4800U 7nm CPU in single-threaded workloads. Even though Intel CPU only has 4 cores (vs 8 cores in AMD CPU), it is only 6-17% slower than AMD CPU.\nSo performance-wise, Intel 10nm CPU still looks pretty competitive against AMD 7nm. With deep pocket, Intel can price Tiger Lake lower than usual to stop AMD from gaining market share.\nWill Tiger Lake become a hit? I think there might be a chance.\n\nhttps://nonperele.com/intel-ceo-robert-swan-bought-shares-after-they-plunged/\n\nhttps://www.anandtech.com/show/15958/intel-schedules-tiger-lake-architecture-presentation-for-august-13th-launch-on-september-2nd\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/wccftech.com/intel-10nm-core-i7-1165g7-cpu-benchmark-vs-amd-7nm-ryzen-4000-upto-20-percent-faster/amp/",

        "selftext": "$ATVI should see significant growth. It closed just under ATH from early Q4 '18 leading up to earnings with a nice run up after Take Two Interactive's beat. I expect it to continue through earnings due to a number of reasons. \n\n1. Candy Crush will Candy GUH-SH\n\n* Top grossing mobile game for the past few quarters (Candy Crush was the highest grossing game franchise in US app stores during Q1)\n* WFH means play from home, at any time of the day, no repercussions\n* Working women &amp; men handing their iPads to their children to play because there is no child care (COVID)\n* If you can't figure this one out just delete your Robinhood app\n\n2. Warzone\n\n* 50M DAU in the first TEN DAYS - 10 fucking days in Q1.\n* Growing user base during pandemic\n* Great F2P monetization with numerous buying points (battle pass, full game conversion, micro transactions) - have seen numerous folks pay for the full game after playing WZ &amp; also buying skins/guns when they typically do not spend ANY money on in game transactions\n* Wall street doesn't understand what this means for Activision. Call of Duty is one of the highest selling franchises on release for each console. Adding a F2P component, being one of the most popular games on Twitch, and capitalizing on Tik Tok's growth will be huge.  \n\n   * See an example of someone who is bullish but doesn't understand gaming: \"Activision Blizzard has been losing ground to companies like ***Riot Games*** for a while now. The [success](https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/league-of-legends-overtakes-fortnite-to-become-the-most-watched-game-on-twitch-in-2019) of its flagship title ***Fortnite*** has taken the gaming world by storm. Activision Blizzard *does not have any games that can match the popularity of Fortnite at the moment.* However, Activision Blizzard has ***arguably the most diverse portfolio of popular games***. This makes it less reliant on current gaming trends or the success of single franchises. The recent growth in popularity of relatively old franchises like World of Warcraft showcases Activision Blizzard's staying power.\" https://seek ingalpha.com/article/4362774-activision-blizzard-is-riding-high-despite-pandemic\n   * This person has a bull case for Activision while simultaneously missing that WZ is more popular than Fortnite at the moment, not knowing that Epic Games owns Fortnite, and saying \"but they have the best portfolio\".\n\n3. Overwatch\n\n* Don't follow this game as much but one of the most popular esports in a pivotal point of the gaming landscape\n* Overwatch 2 on the horizon with a loyal player base\n\n4. WOW\n\n* PC gaming has been absolutely crushing (AMD, NVDA benefited)\n* Loyal fanbase returning due to more expansion packs\n* Upcoming release this fall\n\n5. Forward Guidance\n\n* Literally impossible this isn't hugely bullish\n* Take Two just reported a very positive industry outlook\n* Q3/4 console releases are expected to make historic numbers - PS5/XB1X\n* NVDA/AMD new GPUs expected this fall with a crazy PC gaming market (many parts are sold out or selling above retail price)\n\nTLDR: Blindly throw your money at my positions for 2-5x (I was right on AMD a few days prior to the huge run)... JK read the post it's in bullets so even you can digest. Also, Take Two is up 30% from it's ATH around the same time as $ATVI.\n\n[Positions.](https://preview.redd.it/6dwlonje2we51.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5280142c107c84de12a762bfb2693b163d99c13)",

        "selftext": "So I'm just an 18 year old kid. Back in February a guy tried shilling Robinhood to me, I did it, he got a free share, everything was fine. I ended up finding subs about coins and stuff on reddit, joined some, made like a 2% gain on my initial ~$300 deposit. It was my life savings. \n\nI guess I got lucky, because I had planned to have 2 early release periods for my senior year, but in the second semester my schedule changed and I got placed into personal financial literacy. This was when I got shilled Robinhood by a kid living in a mansion, there were lots of rich at my school, I was one of the poorer kids. \n\nAnyway, I found WSB not long after getting RH. This was a week or two before the crash happened. I literally skimmed through the daily thread and bought whatever was shilled, like a complete idiot, I had no clue what I was doing. https://imgur.com/b6H7X5U my navie self with AMD\n\nI found myself getting into put debit spreads in early March, managed to get up to $500, then I held them, lost it all throughout late March and April. \n\nA guy who was/is deep into drugs contacted me to trade for him, I learned to trade with it more properly, he was down 90% the last time I saw his account. It was like paper trading. However, on April 30th, I accidentally discovered a method for free money, it deals with options, I didn't know it at the time, but it was arbitrage. \n\nOn May 1st, I deposited my $15 allowance. In my first day I managed to turn that $15 into ~$1400. I felt incredible, mania, euphoria, everything, that was more money than I could have ever dreamed of having. That next Monday, I made over 3,300, it was crazy, for a few weeks, that was my best day. From May 1- ~ Late July, I manually did each trade every single day, each trade would net me from $1-12 profit per trade. There were days I would do up to 1500 trades per day, those were my best days, my highest profit in a day was 6.9k. From May 1st-June 30th, I averaged 2.1k a day in profit, these are all realized.\nhttps://imgur.com/TkOmZkR May 1st, it was a Friday as well.\nMay 15th https://imgur.com/PPSBYec I believe it was a Friday as well\nMay 29th https://imgur.com/SHOZE4w\nJune 16th https://imgur.com/JWoQwfS\nJune 29th https://imgur.com/BsZsXDD\n\nMy mom's account July 31st https://imgur.com/ZKvqXxL\n\nMy mom started June 1st with $15, I told her to put $15 in, and it ended up working beautifully. She actually realized 25k just today, 8/10. I moved across the country last week, so I am not able to take a picture of her screen rn, but I could always ask her to. \n\nAll of May was good for the arbitrage strategy, it took a few weeks for me to realize it was arbitrage, I found another guy on the sub describing arbitrage with options, and I messaged him, he had been using a bit more difficult version that wasn't as profitable, I guess Occam's razor always wins, my method is a lot more basic and profitable, I am unfortunately not going to say the details, but I can say, Google options arbitrage, and it will pop up, I am not going into too much detail, because if too many people did it, it would become less profitable and eventually, unprofitable, and I'm still trying to have my mom be able to do it, it's the least I can do for her.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/iroMb6z \nOn Friday when I was in Mattress firm shopping for a mattress, I got a call from a cali number, I didn't think much about it, also my box spring fabric decided to tear once we got on it, I checked my emails later and say my account had been restricted and that I had received an email from Elliot there. He was the one who had called me, he called me again right around market open, I thought it was a scam or something at first. He asked for my name and last 4 digits of my social, I said, can we just do it by email instead, because I didn't want to go willy nilly giving out my personal information to a potential scammer. It seems to be legit. \n\nRobinhood labeled me as a professional trader because I placed on average more than 390 trades per day. I manually did each trade every single day to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity for as long as possible. The tough thing is, the Robinhood card is my first and only card, I use it for everything, so idk what to do, should I open a bank account and use their debit card? I'm also hoping to get approved to trade level 2 options on TD and Schwab. Any other good brokers?\n\nKinda wrote this really manic because the stress from the situation I guess triggered it, this is probably hard to read. Also spent over $800 on reddit coins in the last month.\n\nTLDR: made lots of arbitrage trades, Robinhood banned me",

        "selftext": " Since   its\u2019 Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares   have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its\u2019   next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive   collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality   the situation has been years in the making for those who\u2019ve been  paying  attention. Today I\u2019d like to look at some of the technical  decisions  Intel made, why they\u2019ve caused problems and the implications  of that on  their future.\n\n**Lithography techniques**\n\nLithography   is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible   competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a   template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and   shine a powerful laser on it [\\[1\\]](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html).\n\nOver   time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area \u2013 this   would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption   and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling\\[2\\]. This becomes   progressively more difficult over time, as you\u2019re trying to cram   transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a   hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm   mark, since the size of the laser you used to \u2018print\u2019 the circuit design   became so relatively big that it couldn\u2019t reliably follow the   complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of   thought developed to address this problem \u2013 patterning (using more than   one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with   each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet,   using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel   saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its\u2019 22 and 14nm   process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on   its\u2019 10nm process.\\[3\\] Meanwhile, its\u2019 competitors TSMC and Samsung  chose  EUV. \\[4\\] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to  pursue EUV  for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to  which was the  right choice\u2026\n\nOther  terminology  I\u2019ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a  wafer is  actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of  the wafer  as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed  from  several pieces of silicon stuck together)\n\n**The problems with 10nm**\n\nBack   in 2013, Intel was in it\u2019s prime. It dominated the CPU market with   &gt;90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its\u2019   chips \u2013 every two years you would have a die shrink \u2018tick\u2019, then the   alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change \u2018tock\u2019. In   the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next \u2018tock\u2019   of 10nm in 2016. The \u2018tick\u2019 \u2013 Skylake architecture came, but the \u2018tock\u2019   never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released,   10nm still isn\u2019t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake   in 2018 \u2013 but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not   hundreds. On paper, the \u2018mass-market\u2019 generation Ice Lake launched in   2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior   performance to Intel\u2019s own 14nm offerings. \\[5\\] The latest update is that   desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 \u2013  but  for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet   again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total  writeoff,  and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage  have doomed  it to failure.    When you use lithographic techniques, you  are bound to  have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating  billions of  devices tens of atoms in size isn\u2019t going to be perfect.  Patterning as a  lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect  rate than not  using it \u2013 you\u2019re basically going through the same  process multiple  times, thus increasing the chance of defect  dramatically. As I mentioned  earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in  10nm \u2013 this means their  defect rates are going to be sky high. At the  same time, their usage of a  monolithic die compounds this problem for  high-performance, high core  count CPU models. As you can see from the  blue wafer below, it\u2019s  difficult to draw large squares (high-core count  models) that are  without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD\u2019s  chiplet approach,  built on TSMC\u2019s less defect-prone EUV process.\n\n(Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here)\n\nSince   you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you  use  a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting  you  freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to  build.\n\nOf  course, it\u2019s impossible  for anyone outside Intel to know the exact  numbers for the defect  rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt  they are improving as  time goes on,as they always do with a maturing  architecture. However, I  can say with certainty that\n\n1. they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS\n2. The   margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has   traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the   last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole   product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%.   The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only   by AMD\u2019s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance.   If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy   margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5   year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers   would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues.\n\nThese   are bold statements but I believe Intel\u2019s actions over the past few   years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view.\n\nWhen   you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it   be \u2018better\u2019 than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly   obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent   flaws that you can\u2019t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer   architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own   previous-generation Phenom II architecture \\[6\\], leading to   near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising   core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the   future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs,   massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture.   Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design   choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce   10nm high core count chips. This would\u2019ve been fine if their monopoly   continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs.   Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4  cores.  However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count  capable Zen  architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising  their own core  counts to compete \u2013 there has been a doubling of core  counts across  their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with  its\u2019 double  patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of  10nm mean that  current generation chips at the same price point from  Intel have 14nm  massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core  counts outweighing  any density improvements that 10nm brings.  Similarly, leaks for the  upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake  Xeon chips suggest that  the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28,  will  be 33-50% lower than those  from 14nm \\[7\\] \u2013 not to mention AMD\u2019s  offerings which top out at 2.3x  the core count at half the price.\\[8\\]  The persistent lack of chips on  10nm that can outperform their  predecessors, despite us now technically  being on \u201810nm+++\u2019, suggests  that there is a fundamental barrier in the  technology that no amount of  delays and extra engineering can get past.  10nm is rotten from the  very first steps taken.\n\n**7nm and beyond**\n\nSo   now we\u2019ve established just how much of a disaster Intel\u2019s 10nm process   is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its\u2019 built  on  the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it  to  be Intel\u2019s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was   widely attributed to the \u20186 month delay\u2019 in 7nm rollout. While I don\u2019t   have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just   want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2  call  were \u2018we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm\u2026 12 months behind our   internal target\u2026 we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield   degradation\u2019.\n\nThere\u2019s quite a  lot  to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call,  were  confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at  the  same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The  truth is  that Bob\u2019s claim of a \u2018buffer in planning process\u2019 as the  reason, while  technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any  typical launch of a  new process node, you spend a few months getting up  to speed \u2013 running  the foundry through the whole process,  troubleshooting, using the  produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM  partners for them to design  products around, etc. You don\u2019t sell the  chips produced to anyone.  Industry standard is to call this period a  tape-out, not a launch of a  new process \u2013 that\u2019s when you actually  produce chips that you sell to  people. Bob\u2019s comment translated is that  the process is delayed by 12  months, but they\u2019re going to breach  industry standard and \u2018launch\u2019 7nm  when the first fabs start spinning  up 6 months before they have chips in  any volume. Sound ridiculous?  Well, Intel did the exact same thing with  10nm. Faced with mounting  pressure over the constant delays, Intel  \u2018launched\u2019 Cannon Lake in May  2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole  generation, a dual core processor  with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was  slower than the i3-3250 released  in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm  part. Not to mention it was nigh on  impossible to actually buy one.\\[9\\]  Cannon Lake was an incredibly  obvious paper launch, released to appease  investors at a time where  Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake,  the first 10nm  architecture you could actually buy (in limited  quantities) shipped in  September 2019, more than a year after Cannon  Lake \u2018launched\u2019. This  \u20186-month\u2019 delay is nothing more than an attempt to  sweetcoat a 12 month  delay (assuming no further delays).\n\nThe   second part of the comment, relating to a \u2018defect mode\u2019, is just as   interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology   for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information  suggesting  they might move away from this if it proves to be too  difficult. \\[10\\]  GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is  a new and  unproven transistor technology that should overcome the  technical  difficulties current transistor technologies face at  increasingly  smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is  going to a  completely new type of transistor and we only have one other  comparable  in history \u2013 the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few  years ago.  With FinFet, the research process from having a \u2018working  prototype\u2019  demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. \\[11\\]  Meanwhile,  the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years  ago.\n\n\\[12\\]  While FinFeT and  GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the  plans from  Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly  ambitious. The  latest leaks suggest that the \u2018defect mode\u2019 Intel have  ran into has to  do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true,  you could easily  see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is.\n\nBeyond 7nm, there are some positives to be [found.](http://found.as/)   As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV   and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage   in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm.   At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs.  They  might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've  finally  come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little  technologies, all of  which I'll explore in a future blog post.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI\u2019ll   leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these   deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is   far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel   will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet   another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD,   outsourcing production fully and writing off its\u2019 own fabs?   Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible   margins from their monopolistic position?\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] [http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html)\n\n\\[2\\][Dennard,    R., Gaensslen, F., Hwa-Nien Yu, Rideout, V., Bassous, E. and Leblanc,    A., 1999.

For example, in 2017, they dropped 32 bit app support for iOS 11. In 2018, their macOS Mojave forced developers to use their Metal framework (That's why Nvidia cards don't work anymore in eGPUs) In 2019, macOS Catalina dropped support for 32 bit apps.\n\nThese 3 steps are incredibly important to the Apple Silicon Macs coming this Fall because one of the most important features is the ability to run completely unmodified iPhone and iPad apps on day 1, which of course, are 64 bit apps that run using the Metal framework on the current Apple Silicon chips. manufactured by TSMC. \n\nBecause of this, the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon chips is gonna be much more smooth compared to the previous transition from PowerPC to Intel chips. \n\nA major benefit for the future is that app developers can build apps that have most of the code shared across all Apple devices, which minor adjustments to get the UI to scale properly from the Mac, to the iPad, to the iPhone and of course the Apple TV.\n\nAnd a huge benefit will be the ability to fix bugs and optimize code for all platforms at once instead of having to do it all separately since the main code is shared.\n\nAnd unlike the last transition, Rosetta 2 can now translate x86 app code into ARM-supported code during the install time instead of using real-time emulation. And for plugins and drivers, Rosetta 2 emulates them as well.\n\nDevelopers who have been using Apple's Developer Transition Kit with the A12Z chip from the iPad Pro have already mentioned that Rosetta 2 works incredibly well, much better than expected:  \n[https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20](https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/never\\_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20)\n\nAnd this is with the A12Z chip, which mind you, hasn't changed in terms of processing performance from the A12X chip from 2018. This is also a chip that comes in an iPad Pro that is thinner than any iPhone ever, and has absolutely zero active cooling. \n\nThat chip from 2018 currently outperforms Intel's brand new 10th-gen 10nm chip that came in the 2020 MacBook Pro in terms of both processing and Metal graphics performance.\n\nApple Silicon Macs will of course, have active fan cooling, and Apple has already stated that their Apple Silicon chips for their Macs will be a brand new family of chips, and each Mac will have a chip built specifically for it's enclosure and it's cooling capabilities.\n\nAnd Apple has mentioned that their Silicon has been built for years with easy scalability in mind, so they can add much more cores into the new Mac chips, especially since they'll have active fan cooling. \n\nBecause of the pandemic, Apple's original plans to release a new iPad Pro this Fall with the brand new A14X chip built on TSMC's new 5nm process and a new Mini-LED display were delayed, so that's why the released the 2020 iPad Pro in March, where they basically reused the A12X chip and rebranded it.\n\nSo right now, most investors have no idea how good the A14X is gonna be.\n\nThe A13 chip from last year's iPhones already performs incredibly well in terms of single-core performance, almost neck and neck with Intel's i9-9900K.\n\nThe new A14 chip will be a major improvement, due to being the first chip built on TSMC's 5nm chip.\n\nThere will also be an A14X chip will have a massive improvement over the current A12Z chip, and let me remind you that it will be in an iPad Pro that's thin and passively cooled.\n\nThis same 5nm technology is gonna be scaled up to fit active cooled Apple Silicon Mac computers, first coming into MacBooks like the MacBook Air and the 13\" MacBook Pro, and then into the redesigned 24\" iMac. \n\nOne of the first rumored chips will be a 12-core 5nm chip built by TSMC with 8 high performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. This will likely go into the MacBook Pro. \n\nI'm almost certain that it will outperform the previous Intel-based MacBook Pros in every way. And on top of that, the new Apple Silicon chips will come with Apple's Neural engine and machine learnings accelerations. Along with that, they'll get the same HEVC hardware accelerators as well, which is now becoming the standard for video recording. \n\nBasically, the point of all of this is that TSMC's new 5nm chips that will come in the Apple Silicon Macs are gonna be much faster than anyone is expecting, and those first Macs are rumored to be coming this October or November. \n\nThese chips will shake the entire industry due to the vast performance per watt improvements and the way Apple is gonna use them in terms of their Apple devices sharing the same code. \n\nAnd if Apple succeeds in this transition, there's a very good chance that the rest of the industry will start slowly switching to ARM-based chips, which TSMC is the leader in. (Intel is way behind in ARM chip technology)\n\nBecause of this, TSMC will be confirmed as the leader in chip-making technology, and investors will jump onboard.\n\nTheir main advantage is that they're the first to 5nm, and Samsung is currently having trouble with their 5nm process. Their Note 20 Ultra isn't launching with 5nm chips like people expected.  \n\"A new [report](https://www.zhitongcaijing.com/content/detail/324146.html) out of China (via [*GizmoChina*](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/08/05/samsung-lost-qualcomm-5nm-orders-tsmc/)), however, suggests Samsung may have lost most, if not all, of that business to Taiwanese rival TSMC\"\n\n[https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875](https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875)\n\nSo Samsung is having trouble. Intel is having trouble, ordering wafers from TSMC. AMD is ordering wafers from TSMC. Qualcomm is ordering wafers from TSMC.\n\nTSMC is now becoming the Sony of the chip-making world. (Sony owns the camera sensor market by such a vast margin that a TON of cameras come with Sony sensors)\n\nWhat if TSMC becomes the next Sony and more companies rely on them for chips instead of investing into their own chip technology? \n\nSummary: Buy Long calls. Especially while the whole market is having a down day today. Buy the dip!\n\nPositions: TSM $100c 1/15/21",

We are left with TOCK. Wait there is even more hidden value here. C is \u20ac. So we have big BIG moneys at $$\u20ac and we are left with TOK. Twitter comes out of left field and acquires Tik Tok this week. \n\nTWTR 8/14 $40",

        "selftext": "Some of you guys know that Livongo and Teladoc merged and the stock has not reacted well to the news. Fortunately, the true Amazon of health care has been created and the merger dip has only created an opportunity for anyone with a proper working brain to see that it is an easy 5-10x bagger if you play with the right calls (basically any of them tbh) and stocks. This 18.5 billion dollar deal (3rd biggest in 2020 so far), is clearly a winner, both CEO's are excited about it and it is clearly an easy way to own this segment (combine two of the biggest players in virtual healthcare? No shit) . \n\nProof?\n\nGuess who has been loading up on TDOC stocks these past two days? ARK investment (ARK dont miss) purchased 121736 shares today and 393890 yesterday right after the merger was announced.\n\nhttps://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_234323774.png https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_234202394.png\n\nTrump is signing a order boosting the usage of telehealth in rural locations, reported just 3 days ago: https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/03/trump-executive-order-rural-health-care-telehealth-390947\n\nForbes article on the merger: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasefeiger/2020/08/05/say-hello-to-the-largest-virtual-care-company-the-38-billion-teladoc-livongo-merger/#7054de0378e0\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTLDR: A clear victory in the online health game has been created and there is a dip for you guys to get in at unlike missing out on the PRPL or the AMD train. Analysts already predict this stock to the be the amazon of healthcare in the online space and will only grow larger as the number of rural doctors decrease and people are more hesitant of visiting the doctors these days. Both LVGO and TDOC were on rampant gains for the past year and with the combined merger I suspect the gains will be easily amplified (those who had LVGO know the amount of growth that was happening and TDOC is no joke either).

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

        "selftext": "Okay, so I'm writing this here rather than the options sub because this isn't a full-fledged options strategy. It's simply about covered calls and cash secured puts. \n\nTo give you some context, I've been working with my father since September, when we started running this strategy. I've also done it with my own money and realized some things about the capital requirements to be successful writing options. My dad started with about $170,000, and I started with about $45,000. I've dabbled, but I'm now leaning toward going long with about 80% of my money. This will fluctuate, but I think it's best to start with at least $100,000 if you're going to run this strategy, and that should only be no more than 40% of your portfolio if you want to be aggressive. \n\nMisconceptions: \n\n1. **Writing options is risky:** Wrong. It's literally no different than going long. Instead, you're just also collecting a premium for your troubles. The only risk here is singling out certain tickers that might not recover for some time. Hence the reason you need $100k or more: to be able to diversify your positions enough that you're not bagholding on the majority of them. \n2. **Avoid volatile stocks:** My god, this one is the most ridiculous of them all. The only reason--and I mean ONLY REASON--that you would avoid volatile tickers is because you're emotional. Volatile stocks pay higher premiums. Volatile stocks allow you to write on them at big discounts. Volatile stocks might run up before you sell the call, or allow you to collect decent premiums at higher strikes. I've seen people list stocks like Apple, NVDA, Facebook, AMD and Netflix as stocks to avoid when writing options. These are literally the very stocks that made us the most money. Volatility means absolutely nothing if the companies are good, and these companies are much more than good. \n3. **What if the market tanks:** Okay? So...what? People cite some quote about picking up pennies on a train track, when that was attributed to naked options. If you're long anyway, then you're in no different position. I have absolutely no idea why this is cited as a reason to avoid writing options. This, mathematically, makes absolutely no sense, and you cannot prove me wrong. \n4. **Long dated options:** Stop. Just stop. If you're not writing weeklies, you have no idea what you're doing. Again, math: the premiums are higher (yes, they are higher, do the math); you can better aim your strikes; and you don't have to sit there for months on end biting your nails as the market does what it does. \n5. **The object is to make as much premium as possible without my shares being assigned:** Huh? This isn't a long strategy. This is an options strategy; the whole idea is to make outsized weekly gains, between 1-4%. Any capital gains are bonus (though they can be big as well in certain cases). If you're trying to juggle going long with an options strategy, you're just caught in no-man's land. \n6. **Writing options is a neutral to bearish strategy:** Again, why would you listen to your brokerage's tutorial on options trading? Writing calls and puts works in literally any market, except for a crash, in which the only good strategy is shorting, and good luck to you on that one. \n7. **Avoid writing on stocks reporting earnings:** Huh? Again, emotions over logic. Why do I care if my shares get called away because Apple mooned at earnings? If I'm making 3-4% on premium--IN ONE WEEK--why am I getting the FOMOs? Why are you dumping Amazon because it fell 4% after earnings? Why aren't you instead selling another call at the price you bought? Stop shooting yourself in the foot. \n8. **You will miss out on dividends:** This might be the dumbest of them all. When I'm collecting 1-4% weekly, do you think I give two \\*hits about dividends? We once executed a  daily SPY put at near the market bottom in March that netted over 500% annualized. And you're bringing up *dividends*? \n9. **Taxes:** So you have to pay taxes on money you make. Would you rather not make money? Okay then what are we talking about? Also, you can use your IRA if you have enough in there. Enough said. \n\nHere's a brief overview of the strategy. You pick stocks you really like, and then you check earnings each week. Do a good balance of quality stocks and quality stocks reporting earnings, since the premiums are huge. \n\n1. You sell WEEKLY ATM calls or cash secured puts. If you're a little twitchy about the market, sell puts a little further out of the money. Let's say you sell 15 contracts. Two of them dip. You've made 3-4% in a week, so just sell cheaper calls at a strike equal to the cost of the shares. Now you can do it all over again with the shares that got assigned (or didn't if the price was flat or you sold a put). You might make slightly less this week, but with the constant gains, 1-4% per week is going to constantly increase.\n2. Now, for the stocks that you're stuck with, get creative--but be PATIENT. I recently wrote a put on BAC at 28.50. Not my best move, but now I'm waiting, looking to sell longer dated calls. \"Wait, but you just told us to do weeklies.\" With the stocks that are down, not necessarily. That's the beauty of the strategy. If you go long on BAC at 28.50 and don't sell anything, you're shit out of luck until it recovers. At least you can sell a call. Every day I look at what a 28 call with a month to expiration would net me. \"Wait, but you said to write only at the price you bought it at.\" Well, I've already made $50 on the stock, and plus, I don't think it's going to fully recover in a month. Now it's at 26.11, and I can start looking at decent premiums. If they get taken away, fine, I broke even on that one. But for every time that happens, far more often I'll be down on a stock for long enough that I sell enough calls to still make a decent 1-30% annualized profit by the time it's called away. \n3. As for choosing stocks, go with what's good. It's as simple as that. Would you buy Apple? Starbucks? eBay? Verizon? Great, then if it's a good time, such as earnings season or the stock is at a discount, go ahead with it. I like to look at the 52 week highs. It's great to buy stocks at a discount, ESPECIALLY when you've written on that stock before. I can't tell you how many contracts we've written on Apple. It's near a thousand by now. Same with NVDA and Netflix. We're aggressive, because we're emotionless. As I said before, volatility means absolutely nothing when writing options. It's your emotions. If NVDA drops 20%, fine, I don't care. It's a great stock, and at least I collected a premium. I'd happily go long NVDA, and in that case I wouldn't be making anything. I can't tell you how many times we've bought these stocks at discounts because you fools make the price fluctuate. Probably 30% of our profits are riding stocks back up and past where they were, then writing on them again when they fall again.   \nAs for choosing stocks with earnings coming out, the rules are no different; don't write a put on Nikola because the premiums are fat. I.e. don't be an idiot. But it's also about the price. My worst move ever was writing a put on WORK before the past earnings release. I like Slack, it's early but I think they're doing big things. But I sold the put during a run-up prior to earnings. Stupid. Now I'm holding the bag. HOWEVER, as proof of how great this strat is, though I sold the put at 38 strike, I'm writing long dated calls at 32. Why? Because I've already made over $600 writing on that stock. I literally can't lose. Same with Marriott. I wrote so many puts that, after writing one at 111, I could write at less than 90 and still come out even. I won't, because I know it's going to pump after the vaccine announcement, and it's still incredibly undervalued, but again, just another example of how even the losers turn out to be winners if you just run the numbers.\n4. Speaking of running the numbers, it all comes down to math. You write down the price you bought at and/or the strike you sold at. You write down the premium. Then you write down the profit and add to the premium (the difference between the price you bought and the call strike). Recently, I wrote a TMUS put at 108 prior to earnings. It pumped to 116 after--but I made $275. Do you think I give a poop what I 'missed out on' when I just made over 2.5% in one week? Multiple that by 52 weeks and what do you get? And yes, this is consistently reached. Last week we made nearly $8,000. Last month--over $30,000. \n\nMy father and I worked on a $170,000 account starting in late September of 2019. That was only about 15-20% of his portfolio, so he has a lot more than me obviously. It's now almost at 500k. In less than 10 months. This isn't a joke. People laugh at us, tell us we're lying. Could care less. Money is pouring out of our eyeballs. We did this before we even got TDA to let us sell cash secured puts (you have to ask, which is dumb). Once that started, late March was just a deluge of cash. SPY dailies were hundreds of percent annualized. \n\nI wrote this post because I'm thinking about writing a book on this strategy. It's hard though because a) people need to not believe you when you've found out how to do something that's been in front of their face the entire time, and b) as I said, a lot of it is about temperament. If you're the type that would've sold everything in March just because it was bottoming out, you shouldn't even be in the market in the first place. But more so, if you can't handle volatility, uncertainty, and can't be faithful to a plan and trust that the same things that have happened in the market since its inception will continue to happen--i.e. stocks will rise and fall, but mainly they will rise--then you can't execute this strategy. \n\nIf you fall into either camp, a) or b), I couldn't care less. If you don't believe me or need to ridicule me because it helps you feel better about your assumptions, I will still have all of the money we've made. But I'm trying desperately to tell people about this, because I do think it can help give people an opportunity to get a little more out of their portfolio, add some aggressive growth to balance out the long term gains. \n\nOne final note. I started with $45,500 this year, and am now up to about $62,000. I've added a couple grand from work, but other than that, it's just gains. However, most of that is just the investment choices I made. I can't stress enough that this strategy requires a large amount of capital. $100,000 really is a baseline, and even then I think you're a little less flexible than you ought to be. You need to be able to ride out four or five stocks that have dipped, so that you can still write ten or twenty new contracts every week and maintain the cash flow stream. I've pretty much reduced my options strategy for my account to one or two stocks a week. In fact, I might just go back to focusing solely on my dad's account until I have a lot more money to play with. \n\nOkay all, that's my bit. I needed to get that off my chest because I'm really sick of people spreading lies, myths, and generally not understanding the power of this strategy. More than that, I'm sick of the people who refuse to believe me, as if I need to make up some lie about my investing prowess on reddit. I wouldn't be the first to do that, but it's beside the point; it boggles my mind how many people will deny themselves success solely to console their ego. Just as I said about being emotionless, if you can't put money above your need to be 'right,' you're not going to last long in this business.",

Here's the previous list for the last 2 weeks that have done well. Most were weekly-bi-weekly plays, up to a month: REMEMBER, I've done my research and what I actually like, I've looked at the charts, the trends, the candles/patterns, but I'm not posting all of it for you. It's up to you to determine the right trends YOU will follow; I'm just giving you some options. Accountability, make your money! Good Luck!\n\nPDSB, YVR, CPST, KDMN, NLY, TRVN, ETON.\n\nNote, I made 1.2k from TRVN, got back in, I think Monday and Tuesday were just a dump day for those who don't want to play TRVN's possible approval. I'll throw about 3 earnings and 3 PDUFA, and possibly another catalyst play if I like it. I just looked at all of them, and honestly, I wanted 3, but a lot of the ones I looked at I didn't have much confidence in them.\n\nThese are all plays that aren't constantly talked about, or if they are, will be small swing plays.\n\nNOG - Earnings on 8/7/202 - Swing Play, NOG is always one that seems to go down, then right back up. Small swing play if you want to go cheap, but it did spike not long ago. 5 day EMA crossover for 9 and 12 days EMA and a 9 day EMA crossover 12 day EMA.  Bollinger bands, which an easy explanation is consistent fluctuations for day trading plays (not huge in this particular case). Plus NOG has GAPed up today. \n\nABUS - Earnings on 08/07/202 - This one beat it's earnings last time, and recently had a bid over Moderna (Donald Trump's mention on them) for mRNA vaccines. Their earnings are before market, so I'd say if you have a pre-market or day-trade there's a possibility for this to get some quick money. But it is a little tough to call due to it's recent spike. Their average volume is about 37M, so it trades decent enough.\n\nIEA - Earnings 08/11/2020 - GAP-UP, Momentum and recently broke out from a support. Upper Bollinger Band Crossover. Higher than normal volume, you know what that means. Multiple buy indicators, announced at 77M solar contract in Texas. So, I might get into this one. My favorite of the 3, then ABUS. This would be a medium-long hold. You can take profits along the way if you like.\n\nHonorable mentions - This place has probably mentioned these upcoming earnings, too: BIOC, IBIO, TNXP, IDEX, TTOO, BKYI, IZEA, BNGO, and even COTY.\n\nPDUFA/FDA:\n\nAs I mentioned before, I said stay away from MNK, and I am SOLID on that statement, dont go near it. I was bearish before, and they've recently considered Bankruptcy, so yeah.\n\nLPCN - August 28, 2020 - TLANDO - LPCN 1021 Men with low testosterone (Low T) - Similar trend as TRVN, price target of $2.5-$3.0. Most all buys, 1-2 holds, no sells. Get into this one, soon, like this or next week. - They've had a year to fix their issue - The CRL identified one deficiency stating the efficacy trial did not meet the three secondary endpoints for maximal testosterone concentrations (\"Cmax\").  The CRL does not identify any specific issues relating to the chemistry, manufacturing and controls (\"CMC\") of TLANDO.\n\nI'm still pretty bullish on ETON: ETON - August 10, 2020 - FDA status - Allergic conjunctivitis - CRL issued July 12, 2019. NDA resubmitted with new PDUFA date of August 10, 2020. Although positive trend, it's a little less of a trend that TRVN. It's a split between a few sells, a few buys, and a few holds. More buys, followed by sells, then holds. Price target around 12-15, which I think is a little much, so I'd say closer to 7-10 if they are positive in their medicine. This is my write up from previously, BUT, they've recently submitted 2 separate FDA medicines, so there's plenty of catalysts to be had in the near future. \n\nMCRB - August - No official date. I'd only refer this as a swing play. They were spiked in June and July on small, not really drug related news, super small flaot. \n\nOTLK - 1.31 Currently - Set up is similar, but more volatile than TRVN. Wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) - Phase 3 data is due, if the data is good, PDUFA is the next step. Meaning you can catch it on a down-turn (or even now) and sell the news. But careful because if phase 3 data isn't great, then back to square 1.\n\nNEXT LINE UP WILL INCLUDE POSSIBLE- FBIO, CMRX, SPPI, PRTK \n\nList of FDA/PDUFA Phases coming up that I haven't quite look at the data or they haven't specifically popped out at me just yet.",

        "selftext": "I'm hoping some of you can share a bit of advice for a novice. Be brutal. If you think I'm not cut out, let me know. I want to learn, but hopefully not lose too much in the process!\n\nI got on to Revolut a couple of months ago. Bought Delta, SW and MGM thinking they'll go back up after coronavirus. Obviously things have gotten a little worse in the US and those stocks kept dropping. Got impatient, sold and lost money. \n\nMy next venture... Virgin Galactic. Initially bought in around $15, they went up, got excited, continued to plow money in, buying again at$21- $24. Pinned all my hopes on their quarterly earnings thinking they would hit $30... Didn't happen, panicked and sold, again losing more money.\n\nWhat I've learnt is I'm buying stocks without any consideration for the price. My thinking is always \"buy quick before they go up, in a few months time they'll be worth more, so I don't want to miss out\". This is obviously a laughable approach.\n\nMy latest venture is Nio. It's the only stock I own at the minute. Bought in multiple times at $13.37 \u2013 $14.07. Again absolutely no consideration for an entry point.\n\nI'm not so much interested in making a quick buck, my strategy is long term. Ideally I want to have 3-4 stocks that I invest in each month. Then at the end of the year, I take a bit of money out.\n\nMy problem is, I keep chopping and changing. I don't know what companies to pick. I have no problem doing the research, I've got a genuine interest in this stuff, I really like AMD, SPCE, NET, GPS, ATVI, PINS and a bunch of others on my watchlist. But because I'm not investing loads of money, when I see stocks $40+ I'm put off because I think I won't make much of a return.\n\nIs it best to put money aside for investing, but then set price targets for the stocks I like, and then buy in?\n\nI'm completely aware that I'm impulsive and if you haven't already gathered I come from a gambling background. I've certainly learnt, stocks and gambling are way way different.\n\nAny kind of advice/strategy you could share would be much appreciated.\n\nIs NIO a safe bet!?\n\nThanks,\nJason",

Intel is still insanely profitable with lots of collaborations and products lined up. Also safe from any COVID-19 related shutdowns.\n2. Consistent Grind Up history after beatdowns.

        "selftext": "I've got 5 $AMD $35 June 2021 contracts that had already gone deep ITM that was purchased back in April. They're currently worth $5,288. I'm looking to sell those and repurchase a couple of cheaper contracts further dated such as January 2022. I'm extremely bullish on $AMD but with some planned caveats:\n\n1. $AMD will not have too many catalysts in the next two months until the release of their new CPUs, GPUs, and gaming consoles. Thus, $AMD share price will likely level out in the next few weeks, possibly move up slightly in the low $90s.\n2. Once the news start rolling in regarding product reviews and third party sales numbers, it'll lead to share price speculation and then eventually next year post-holidays will confirm whether there will be success. As such, share price will soar to new all time highs. I'm predicting for it to reach a minimum of $100.\n\nWith these assumptions in place, I'm looking at selling all 5 contracts for an approximate $26,440 total. and then using that capital for some new strategies:\n\n1. Don't sell contracts now to take advantage of low theta decay (currently @ -0.007). Keep it all the way until next year May (month before expiration) to take advantage of long term capital gains savings. I'd be saving approximately 7% in tax losses but theta is going to eat away gains here.\n2. Simply move up / roll out by purchasing 7 $AMD $60 January 2022 contracts @ $3,643 for an $25,500. Delta is at .80 and theta is at -.016. I typically negate theta by selling 30-45 DTE OTM calls.\n3. Purchase 10 $AMD $80 January 2022 contracts @ $2,663 for an approximate total of $26,630 (I'll fork over the extra $200 to make it happen). Theta decay is at an aggressive -0.02 and as per my usual strategy, I can negate this by selling 30-45 DTE OTM calls.\n4. Go synthetically long by going to January 2022 and selling 3 contracts of near ATM $90 puts for $2,550 credit and buying $90 calls for $2,245 debit. This leaves me about $900 credit across 3 contracts. However, I need to hold $27,000 as collateral for the whole period of time.\n5. Go synthetically long with a slight twist / risk still with January 2022 expiry. Sell $110 ITM put for $3,900 credit. Buy $60 ITM call for $3,643. Total credit of $2.58 with $22,000 as collateral. This is probably the stupidest play ever but other than the assignment risk, I can't figure out why it would be stupid. \n6. Do a ZEBRA (zero extrinsic back ratio strategy) trade by going short 1 OTM call @ .70 delta and 2 ITM Call @ .50 delta. However, this doesn't seem to work with LEAP calls, only short term calls at 45\\~ DTE. I think this would work quite well in the next few months.\n\nWith that said, I think for the next few months, I could apply strategies 1, 4, and 6. Before the holidays, switch over to strategies 2, 3, and 5. The goal is to preserve gains in the short term and aggressively gain in the long term.\n\nAny thoughts?",

        "selftext": "TSM has been on my radar since I started saving to invest in 2018 because of AMD / GlobalFoundries. Really interesting business model for Semis AMD has.\n\nIn 2019, you couldn't get away from heating up of the trade war. Congress began debating SAR for HK around the end of  Hong Kong's \"2019 Summer of Love\" and rumors of what happens in the \"re-education\" camps / \"Where did the Falun Gong practitioners go?\" This is important because of the SWIFT system of world banking. HK is how they get dollars.\n\nThen in November of 2019, this happened..\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Human_Rights_and_Democracy_Act#Related_bill\n\nArizona plant news is where the tin foil ends and the conviction began for me. The Foundry is basically THE corporation of Taiwan. The Great Cheetoh has been making deals around the world, and technically Taiwan isn't China. We have recent armament deals with Taiwan and Japan to prove it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TLKt9yPb-f0\n\nWhy not?? Seemed like the American thing to do and there is a republican in office hell-bent on decoupling US communications tech from the CCP aka ROC.\n\nIn Feb / March... Rona. April the economic fallout, news about bad PPE and tests from China being sold to Italy. In May all the US boats in Taiwanese waters and the rhetoric worldwide basically reflecting that the world isn't happy with the CCP.\n\nI had the balance for a RH call and it made more sense than an airline play at the time, so i got in.\n\nAnti CCP rhetoric started heating up and bi-partisan on the YouTube's, by the way, it seems 2020 is the year NBC (Comcast) discovered ad-revenue. Thank you Lester.\n\nAt this point morning wood for TSM was a regular thing, so i set my limits on call options for both accounts, and incorporated into the LT DRIP. Thank you Papa Powell. I'm still poor, couldn't have done it without you...\n\nThen it seemed to be heating up at the end of May. Everyone is like WTF 'mate on the \"One Belt. One Road.\" Initiative, both the geographical and digital. People are really starting to report on not-so-great stories out of China, and not just tinfoil or Epoch Times channels.\n\nLot of shade being thrown on China tech, and things are heating up in S China Sea.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6KiLhxgIBys\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BTgDYhtr-LU\n\n...looks like Chy-na is on everyone's shit list, including Australia. Forex folks know how dope-tied the Aussie's and Kiwis are to CCP trade relations.\n\n The rumor was potential decouple from China. I mean the world is kinda dope-tied to Santa's little elves. I just realized how weird Christmas will be...\n\nI bought my shares for both accounts as per the voodoo ritual of purchasing at least 1 stock of a long term call strategy. Got my hand deep (for me) in the cookie jar May and June.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/xb7ptte\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/ToFdT3z\n\nThird week of July called a bull flag on hourly:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hwz949/daily_discussion_thread_for_july_24_2020/fz4bi1b?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nJuly 24th, I got filled to the teeth in RH and my now free play in Webull was up 1,600%.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/0fB3FEp\n\nTHEN July 27th, I closed my \"free play\" in Webull at $1,250. A little over 3,000% between 2 contracts that cost $75 total.\n\nAlong the way, i picked up RH tendies and rebalanced the cash / bought more contracts and shares. They're officially part of the DRIP.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/UFKPnOz\n\n\nRelated post I made last week regarding TSM and INTC. Any thoughts on how US semi production will play out for them?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0jqtu/opinions_on_taiwan_semiconductor/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nLast week, The Fool confirmed many of the LT bias I had been building up on a win for The Foundry since November. All hype, or real talk?\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/31/3-tailwinds-are-lifting-tsmcs-stock-to-new-all-tim.aspx\n\nFinancial analysis-\nThis guy is boring af, but he goes through the numbers that no one likes to read, records in mobile, and is cool enough to zoom in on what he is talking about.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wVxF7wwuogo\n\nCan anyone see a downside other than \"COVID CLAP Trumps all\"? Maybe I've been chewing too much YouTube tinfoil on lunch, but the limit orders that are closing 930-4pm are making me think I've hit the Autistic Lottery. Wish I had bought more.\n\nFriday, all I could see was a bull flag on the 4hr and 30min charts. Monday 8/03 it hasn't shit the bed at 11am EST. Maybe thats just the tin foil talking again and this is the ceiling.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/nRYKBB5",

        "selftext": "Alright retards, strap in. I read the FAA's 96 page summary on the 737 MAX and have the following to report. Here is the link in case you want to read for [yourself](https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/737-MAX-RTS-Preliminary-Summary-v-1.pdf).\n\nThere were 7 different safety items addressed in the report. The biggest issue was the Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor and the way it allowed the pilots to interact with the plane. This sensor would basically override any actions the Pilots wanted to take and the false readings lead to the crashes years ago. The AOA sensor is manufactured by a private company called Rosemount Aerospace.\n\nAnother issue was with the \"maneuvering characteristics augmentation system\" (MCAS) which is the flight control system that is heavily impacted by all the sensors on the plane (especially the AOA).\n\nLooking forward, the FAA has clearly stated requirements that will allow the 737 MAX to return to flight around the world. they are:\n\n*  Completion of all TAB return to service (RTS) recommendations and acceptance by the TAB of those completed actions. (these are the 7 things about AOA and MCAS)\n* Completion by BA and Acceptance by FAA the new regulatory requirements\n* Official revisions to documentation/training for the 737 MAX\n\nAdditionally, there are specific requirements before it can fly in the US:\n\n* For delivered/yet to be delivered 737s, all FAA changes must be incorporated and updated based on the above changes\n* All Pilots must be trained and certified on the new changes BA will be making to aircraft operation.\n\nAfter this is compelte, FAA will issue a  Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC) (example [here](https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/media/CAN-2019-05.pdf)). this basically tells the international 737 MAX owners to:\n\n*  strongly encouraged to mandate the pilot training identified in the 737 MAX FSB report as a minimum starting point\n* be responsible for the continued airworthiness and continued operational safety (COS) of aircraft on its registry \n\nThe rest of the report breaks down in engineering terms what is wrong and how it is going to be fixed.\n\n**TL;DR: FAA is making BA rework all of its 737 MAXs. BA will likely be taking those cost directly out of its own profit margins. Buy calls / stock on their top suppliers, who BA will have to pay for all the new equipment\\***\n\n[**BA TOP SUPPLIERS**](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionNO4.php?supply&amp;code=BA)\n\n* TAITRON COMPONENTS - TAIT (no options)\n* MSFT - whatever you retards are buying for Tik Tok is fine. Leaps will be good here as well\n* TSM - Jan21 80c should work. if you are cheap do 90\n* Intel - more importantly AMD is a supplier and they will eat intel's lunch. Dell and IBM also provide them chips.\n* other big defense companies that subcontract, LMT, NOC, RTX etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*DISCLAIMER**: I am not an engineer, I am a retarded PFA for a DFEN company. I do not have any active positions from above. I will be waiting for a red day to get in.",

        "selftext": "First off, not sure if this type of post is allowed here to just hoping for the best. Thanks for reading if you decide to. I just want to get some frustrations off my chest, and feel like writing it down will help me move on. To preface, I am turning 30 this year to help put all of these numbers in perspective.\n\nI started trading stocks in early 2017. I deposited $5,000 into my account and looked at all my possibilities. Being a gamer, naturally my watch list included the likes of Nvidia, AMD, INTC, ATVI, EA and what else was I familiar with? Tech, so it also included the likes of FB, APPL, NFLX, etc. At this point you get the picture. So now you're probably saying to yourself, almost every single one of these stocks has rocketed since 2017, did I misread his title? No, you didn't. This is where my stupidity takes over. \n\nAlthough I only started with a $5,000 deposit, I've held a well paying desk job since 2017. By no means am I struggling financially, which ultimately was my downfall for trading. Since I had a well paying job, but no capital going into trading, my mentality was all wrong. I thought I had to go for life changing money instead of the 'safe' bets. My thought was, 5-10% a year wasn't going to pay off my student debt, buy a car, nor put a large down payment on a home and theoretically if I lost it all, I would still be financially stable. Enter penny stocks... I took out all my money in the companies that I knew well, and started researching risky penny plays. Montage time: my timing is always off; I chase the profits; I sell out of fear; the nagging of hindsight eats away at every trade I make; I play swings and then miss the big jump. I make every mistake in the book and refuse to learn from them. Stupid decision after stupid decision. Ultimately, I decided to hold onto bags instead of moving to the stable opportunities staring me in the face. Fast forward 3 years later, I have been able to add a total of $70k in cash to my portfolio, but am currently sitting at a market value of $43k. Obviously this isn't terrible, but when considering the market as a whole since 2017, it has been a huge failure. I am finally done, I tried and failed to 'make it big'. \n\nI am currently researching more stable plays and debating if I missed the boat on all the tech stocks I was watching in the beginning.\n\nIf you want to know more specifics I would be happy to provide but knew this was getting long already. Also before you jump to attack me, I know my balance (and more importantly my job) is still very lucky to have at all in the current state of the world. I am thankful for what I have but I let greed get the better of me for far too long. Hopefully I can stop squandering what I have now.",

Would it be a good idea to keep adding to those companies if I\u2019m only able to add maybe 2 shares a month to some?  \n\n\nI do believe in the companies that I hold, also don\u2019t want all my eggs in one basket.. this is a different account from my Roth which in that i hold mostly index funds/ETF\u2019s with 3 individual stocks total... As I\u2019m only able to contribute 6K a year.\n\nThis other account is intended to be added to more often.. but just curious to if I\u2019m better off trimming or just know I\u2019m building positions and keep going and in the long term it\u2019ll be worth it?   \n\n\nsome of the 25-30 stocks I own but not all in this account...

        "selftext": "The new OSS CEO (David Raun) has some intriguing incentives and a much different skillset than the previous CEO (Steven \"Old News\" Cooper). In general, Steven Cooper's background appears to have been more directly tied to the product line (B.A. in electrical engineering) while David Raun is an experienced CEO with at least one major exit and a focus on profitability. I'll leave the skillset analysis to others, but I thought it might be worth sharing some intriguing bits from the new CEOs compensation package.\n\nThe [CEOs full compensation agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1394056/000119312520178183/d948391dex101.htm) (filed with the SEC as an attachment to the [8-k announcing the new CEO hire](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1394056/000119312520178183/d948391d8k.htm)) specifies that \"a discretionary bonus provided that the Company\u2019s common stock price reaches $5.50 per share and remains at or above such price for six (6)\u00a0consecutive months\". It doesn't specify the discretionary bonus amount, but I would assume it would be fairly lucrative considering that would represent \\~150% of increased market cap over the time. The CEO Officially started in June and has been interim CEO since February.\n\nHe's got vesting incentives that lock in at the end of Q2 and Q4 which incentivize him to increase the price $0.25 over the previous six months at the end of the period using a weighted average price.\n\nHis compensation agreement went into effect on June 24, 2020, so it's early in the term of the agreement but it's meaningful that this is the goal. The earning report on Thursday represents the end of Q2 so the price run up here matches the incentive to increase the price over the previous six month period. End of the price around Q4 last fiscal year was $1.80ish so they've easily hit the $0.25 price increase milestone with the current \\~$3 price. That said, I believe the end of Q2 (relevant period for the price escalator) was actually approximately June 20-30 at which point the price was hovering around $2.00. \n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n* The board of directors has incentivized the CEO with a price target of $5.50 (average price over 6 month period during the next three years of the agreement period) and stock option vesting escalators if the price increases $0.25 at the end of Q2 and Q4, pro-rated if he doesn't hit it. \n* CEO has previous exit experience PLX Technologies acquired by the company now known as Broadcom (an OSS partner) and the CEO change would seem to be an indication that they are looking to move toward growth/profitability.\n* Strong partnership list including NVIDIA, AMD, and others.\n* [COVID-19 statement](https://www.onestopsystems.com/coronavirus-covid-19-statement) includes this language: \"Due to the medical, military and other critical applications serviced by our products, the US Undersecretary of State has requested that OSS remain in operation and continue to provide the essential critical infrastructure products we manufacture.\" They had some supply crunch early on during COVID-19, [but according to this CEO interview they never stopped the production line.](https://www.channelchek.com/channelcast-detail/157)\n* A diverse product set that ruggedizes computation in a wide set of markets (e.g. military, medical, autonomous vehicles, media and entertainment, etc) where quick decisions need to be made faster than is possible in cloud computing applications.\n\nKey Resources:\n\n* [8K - SEC filing announcing hiring of David Raun as CEO.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1394056/000119312520178183/d948391d8k.htm)\n* [CEO Employment Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1394056/000119312520178183/d948391dex101.htm)\n* [CEO Interview on OSS product offerings including \"AI on the Fly\" and Edge Computing](https://www.channelchek.com/channelcast-detail/157)\n* [July 21 Corporate Presentation including Customer List, Q1 and Q2 progress, and some fluff.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_e9cdb971205220b8a434fada5addbc0a/onestopsystems/db/354/2817/pdf/OSS+Corporate+Profile+July+2020.pdf) Key customers in industries ranging from aerospace, military/government, medical instrumentation, 5G communications, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nI don't know where this is going, but I like the company's outlook. Long term price outlook is $5.50 at some point over the next three years. I have no idea what's going to happen in the short term.",
