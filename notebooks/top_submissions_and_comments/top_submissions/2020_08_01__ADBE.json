        "selftext": "Good morning fellas. Swaggy is back with a Sunday morning read and summary of unusual options activity for the week. I've highlighted some plays that came across as unusual based on how far OTM the bet was, the premium paid, and the volume of contracts in the play. If you want to check out additional tickers for yourself, you can scan the [unusual option flow tracker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) that I use at your liking (it's free).\n\n**ADBE \u2013 Adobe**\n\nSaw a bullish position in ADBE being opened with a debit spread. My scanner missed the long leg being opened, but I managed to catch the play by digging deeper. I\u2019ve added the OI from Yahoo Finance so you can see the contracts. Stock is currently sitting at $450 after Friday\u2019s -3% move. The debit spread was in October\u2019s $450 strike (long leg) and sold the $490 strike (short leg). Earnings aren\u2019t until September 15.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5zwew1t8zf51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeb0137a19b57af372a8bc574686146ec796933b\n\n**CNK \u2013 Cinemark**\n\nA bit of an unusual ticker for unusual activity. Cinemark saw some pretty heavy call buying on Friday. The stock has been on a bit of a run recently. One player bought calls 80% OTM for the $20 strike (stock is currently $11). This play was only $55k, but highly suspect with how far out the money they went. The play has an expiration date for September 18. I\u2019ve attached Yahoo Finance option chain for August 21 so you can see the heavy volume in the near OTM strikes. This stock typically does not have high volume with options.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfl6sgou8zf51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c240cd54686a66f589a3733cc3a44437c29467d\n\n**FB \u2013 Facebook**\n\nFacebook had a huge melt up Thursday and Friday. Volume on option activity was well above the average for the last 2 weeks. Saw a good amount of CALL buying with some CALL selling far OTM as well. Most of the call selling (potentially covered calls?) were done with expirations in the next 1-3 weeks. The call buying had expirations toward the end of the year and even into 2021. Long-term bullish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h59saplv8zf51.png?width=2856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b36f92032e3c7444ec4f41e4a83bc22468518393\n\n**MSFT \u2013 MicroTok**\n\nMicrosoft saw a massive bullish debit spread opened in November 2020 calls. 75,000 CALL contracts bought with the $220 strike while selling 75,000 CALL contracts at the $240 strike. Looks like the player/fund is expecting upside, but wanted to limit their downside by opening a spread. They have a max risk of $49 million with a max reward of $150 million if MSFT closes above $240 by November.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/804hwqew8zf51.png?width=2858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f76633f4b0db8220a1d1053daa8f54f5b796121\n\n**SDC \u2013 Smile Direct Club**\n\nAnother unusual ticker, this stock saw some unusual call buying recently. Two trades in particular were for next week\u2019s earnings report (August 12). Both trades are for $9 strike, which is currently in-the-money. When the trades were initiated the stock was trading at $8.82. Judging from the OI it looks like of the 16k contracts traded, only 10k are left on the Open Interest. He may have sold part of his position to collect profit, but left a lot on the table for next week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4ish39x8zf51.png?width=2740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08d9b879e6326f3a90959a6c2e9087da82ab9c1c\n\n**Snap \u2013 Snapchat**\n\nSnap saw extremely high volume of call options traded relative to it\u2019s average. Bullish flow out-weighed bearish flow by 3.5 to 1. Could be potential TikTok play as they expect the ban to increase their own share. There\u2019s was a lot of flow to go through on this ticker, so I\u2019m only mentioning that flow in general was above the average here and also more on the bullish side.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy8yygxx8zf51.png?width=2858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a02ccb95317ec638ac9566cbae050a86c6067d22\n\n**V \u2013 Visa**\n\nVisa saw some unusual option flow last week on Wednesday. That day alone the stock gapped up 2% and closed another 3% higher. Stock is currently trading at $196 and most of the call blocks had strikes of $202.5-$205. Visa generally does not have that much volume on option flow so it\u2019s always interesting to keep an eye on. If you look at the price action of the stock is has been in range-bound trading in the $190-$200 channel for almost 3 months now. Hit\u2019s $200 and drops back down to $190, then touches $190 and makes it\u2019s way back up to $200. Maybe some flow rolling through will be enough to have it break out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l7wovjqy8zf51.png?width=2860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92e352e915225089fb7e9f31524ed1fe04cbdefd",

In some ways I was privileged because I got to work with my dad in factories during an era where manufacturing technology started to change in drastic ways.

The best education technology companies are those that support the flow of education with high quality tooling rather than trying to replace it. Under this framework, I regularly invest in things like Autodesk, Adobe, and Dropbox as the companies have created an environment where IT school administrators will offer Creative Cloud, Autodesk, and Dropbox services under their student email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are familiar with the American education system, you know that this is an absurdly slow dinosaur when it comes to getting changes in motion. Technology, as a result, has to execute in rather phenomenal way to even have a chance in the education space. This is why you'll see awfully accessible and robust technology exist in the space - Windows, Macs, Chromebooks, Khan Academy, Symbolab, Dropbox, Adobe, Autodesk, Oracle, Blackboard, Canvas, etc. They are convenient tools that pay a lot of attention to things like ADA (disabilities) compliance and the like.\n\nThere is a revolution occurring in education in the form of disabilities pedagogy (the study of how to teach). Unlocking a lot of understanding in children with non-verbal autism, PTSD, and other serious learning challenges is an enormous frontier in teaching, learning, and understanding human development. \\*\\*These technologies do not get in the way and exist to assist.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as a Technical Product\n\nThe File &amp; Storage system in any given operating system will always be critically important to a user and the need will always be larger than you can anticipate. It extends from IT safety, banking, education, supercomputing, and so on. Can you evaluate the amount of storage and data needed after Machine Learning tools have grown for 10 years? It can not be determined, but it can be anticipated. Organizations that have built their own distributed infrastructure are advantaged. One can reasonably assume that these companies will distribute the building blocks to their products. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu67kf179qe51.png?width=2953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16a1ce179420a08750c5df246064f6eebdad30cc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: the CEO is currently in the Board of Directors of Facebook - who is also looking into workspace applications \\*\\*SPECIFICALLY TO SOLVE LONG TERM WORK-FROM-HOME COMMUNICATIONS\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workplace @ Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/vpcnvvru4qe51.png?width=3382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b3f6da6502c53102a73047c4b13977f3d498b1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workspace @ Dropbox](https://preview.redd.it/rr462ns25qe51.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb2ba0e8e4fcc2bc24e82129bd0e209bee2d55d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is an enormous list of high-quality features that Dropbox offer due to its integration and infrastructure approach across multiple platforms:\n\n* \\- File security\n\n[banned by xi](https://preview.redd.it/mtg94ntd8qe51.png?width=1411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e62965952b2e9b876860beede13c106b59115f6)\n\n* \\- Signatures\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewaxdbdl8qe51.png?width=2791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce09ff54bad22b1920a33326478f69e11171a81d\n\n* \\- Computer vision document scanning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OCR](https://preview.redd.it/0551mtwz8qe51.png?width=2413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22ec6a63fe1fe5935dea0d7c743ea4a202f7a393)\n\n* \\- Workspace expectations (file syncing, large file transfers, organization,IT controls)\n* \\- Link generators to leak those sweet unreleased albums through zoom [https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0)\n* \\- File embedding \n* \\- Self-built storage infrastructure\n* \\- Deep industry wide integrations ranging from Zoom to Adobe\n* \\- Deep relationships in the education sector\n* \\- An unholy amount of other file solutions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hicx44ptdqe51.png?width=2547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc087db00260d31a49e3c33a32020848f9d91e05\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Compliance Advantage\n\nCloud computing is no longer a mystery, nor is it an open secret. It's a necessary supply chain tool, demanded, and growing faster than imaginations can keep up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work in the fintech industry. Let me tell you, compliance is everything. There is no Square, Paypal, Dropbox, Cloudflare, or any of your favorite important apps without various degrees of compliance. It would be much more helpful to view Square as an organization that distributes compliance to it's small businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \\- For Banking it's the Bank Secrecy Act and PATRIOT Act\n* \\- For Education it's FERPA\n* \\- For Healthcare it's HIPAA\n* \\- The list goes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean? It's means that mature cloud companies like Cloudflare, Dropbox, and the like are in an excellent positions to \\*\\*satisfy the legal means to continue to grow at scale\\*\\*. This is an extremely important factor to consider in the next 5 years. **Dropbox is not something people \"get\" -  it's something that they're \"given\".** For example, when I signed my name to accept my first career job - I was given Dropbox's HelloSign to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cloud Computing Hierarchy of needs](https://preview.redd.it/s3hfokxg5qe51.png?width=2981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ff1c87c8db5802df55d7f4156ee9b9f2e4f23c4)\n\n[Compliance advantage in education](https://preview.redd.it/s1qhcdxj5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34678980f20b163d47ec041add6defae67720038)\n\n[Another example of compliance-focused approaches](https://preview.redd.it/6nhym58n5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bc8101854eaa2a29f643f630024be629b23b9de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Monopoly Problem &amp; Integrations Competitors\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d1vs3oy5qe51.png?width=1835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81db898c8bd65364d7b2162ede4daecd5455547e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverybody knows it. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple is a monopoly cluster on data. Breaking them up is not a complex equation. Much like the death of a drug or religious cartel; there are many other viable candidates eager to steer the wheel in another direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is possible to compete against them, as evidence by organizations like Dropbox, Cloudflare, TikTok, Zoom, and the like. These smaller companies combining is what I consider the Unicorn Operating System. There opportunity is by distributing infrastructure to overwhelm larger companies that depend on acquisitions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is already happening.

        "selftext": "Swaggy is back with his Sunday morning read of Unusual Options Activity. I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.\n\nIn addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).\n\nAs for unusual trades, it\u2019s been pretty quiet the last two weeks. Most flow is coming into big tech stocks and pumping them higher. I caught a few other smaller plays that I\u2019ll get into the details of here.\n\n**MSFT \u2013 Microsoft Corporation**\n\nMicrosoft has been a repeat name for some bullish flow in the last months. Looks like players have been opening bull call spreads with relatively medium-term expirations (end of the year) expecting the stock to continue it\u2019s slow rise up. The range of strike prices has been $215-$240. MSFT has been one of the companies looking to acquire TikTok in the latest rumors. Other names that have seen some similar flow last week were AMZN, FB, ADBE, and of course, AAPL.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmrkvz3e4ri51.png?width=2150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5128bc760d4ad4905cf479242fa4be52c7dfcd5\n\n**NVDA \u2013 NVIDIA Corporation**\n\nNVDA reported earnings last week and although they blew estimates out of the water, the stock remained flat post-earnings. NVDA demonstrated some high growth in their server market and overall they have been one of the best performing tech stonks. Flow has been mixed, but leaning on the bullish side. Overall activity has picked up greatly since last week as traders could be expecting another move up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1klzg6ze4ri51.png?width=2430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d91676e3f077ecd17e9a2f2d604de2ac8b64563\n\n**QCOM \u2013 QUALCOMM Incorporated**\n\nQCOM is another semi-conductor company that has seen a good run over the last several months. Players placed bets that the company would continue it\u2019s steady rise up as demand for chips in a more data-driven world are becoming the new norm. A lot of calls were traded with strikes in the $105-$120 range. These mostly have expirations from November to January 2021, so they are mid-term in the timeframes and expectations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rv6wpktf4ri51.png?width=1610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f5f1ed70da42174709714410765d64535b69f56\n\n**ORCL \u2013 Oracle Corporation**\n\nORCL has seen an uptick in activity on the bullish side. Rumors are they are making a bid for the TikTok acquisition as well. ORCL\u2019s stock price has been somewhat stagnant over the last several months and they didn\u2019t rally as hard as the rest of big tech from the March lows. The option flow might indicate a bullish move in the future for this stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6njzexg4ri51.png?width=2420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fcb092d4b6735bb223c38bedc6fff892e0e33f7\n\n**LYFT \u2013 Lyft Inc**\n\nLYFT and UBER have shut down service in California due to a new ruling that would require them to treat independent contractors as employees with benefits moving forward. Their rebuttal was to simply shut-down service and put the pressure back on the government to make their next move. Soon it will show that these ride-sharing companies have become a staple in our societal culture as they have made our lives so much easier. A whole slew of some pretty large calls were opened last week that was caught as bullish flow. I\u2019m not sure what the catalyst would be here, maybe it\u2019s because the stock is near the lows and shutting down service actually induces less losses on the company. Who knows.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pxz92li4ri51.png?width=2020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5eed0add829b6b63c17a73322ccab635ca8d309\n\n**DLTR \u2013 Dollar Tree Inc**\n\nDollar Tree caught some unusual call volume last week. Looks like players are betting on a 10% gain in the stock price with the October strike. These bets weren\u2019t unusually large in size, but for a company like DLTR they were pretty significant. The plays were sweeps at the $108 strike in Sept 25/Oct 02 expirations. The stock has had a decent run over the last several months and the players are expecting another leg up soon. We\u2019ll see about this one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3dkhbkj4ri51.png?width=1902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1de6a827de4fd6572df1600de3f839783271624\n\n**CRM \u2013 Salesforce**\n\nCRM/Salesforce has been a hot stock recently. There was some bullish flow earlier this month and again into last week. My scanner picked up two long position, although in my opinion it looks like a spread was opened (still bullish). The spread was actually opened when the stock was trading at $197, and it is currently $10 higher at $207. The player bought to open 11,000 calls at the $200 strike and sold 11,000 calls at the $220 strike, paying $9 million for the position. They are already profitable on their position, but if CRM closes above $220 by February, they will have a net profit of $22 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkw6lpok4ri51.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cf3112c70a994a5724707e18b3376cb6490b43d\n\n**CZR \u2013 Caesars Entertainment Inc**\n\nCZR caught some bullish activity last week when players opened January and March 2021 calls. The stock has already had an unbelievable recovery from the March lows, but is still nowhere near the highs. Looks like as the country opens back up again (if it stays that way), they expect the company to continue it\u2019s good performance. Some of the bullish flow was put-selling, which suggests the stock will have already reached it\u2019s long-term bottom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzkpssol4ri51.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7978edf9012a3334d7978075da93bac94215fd1",

I am having great trouble picking one over another though and would like to hear some input. I\u2019ll start with my thoughts.\n\n\nNetflix\n\nWhile competing against many other streaming services, I simply cannot see them going anywhere or being beaten in the long run. Their Netflix Originals are far and away better than other streaming services\u2019 original productions, and they are rapidly expanding globally, tapping into a much larger market.\n\n\nAdobe\n\nThe company I know the least about but am strangely attracted to the most. Adobe sets the bar for video creation and editing and has a very impressive chart and balance sheet. I am worried about growth, though I do think if they successfully tap into cloud computing more they will substantially rise. \n\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia\u2019s GPUs are so far advanced that it poses as barriers to entry for other competitors, with these companies settling for having the \u201cbest\u201d middle or lower tier GPUs. Nvidia also stands as an industry leader and analyst pick to develop and perfect autonomous driving technology.",

I felt closer expiration is safer, as the price cant move too much in 2 days... Thoughts ?! Also, I feel like with spreads, you need to hold on to them till close to expiry, due to extrinsic value still built inside of them, that you wont be able to capture. For instance, in TOS, the purple curve is today and the blue line is at expiry, and the blue line is always more profit than the purple curve. Thanks!!!!!! Also, is it a good idea to hold a spread to expiry? Why is assignment such a bad thing. On tastyworks it costs 5 dollars to excersize an option contract... What is such a big deal about worrying about assignment and closing out early... Thanks",

        "selftext": "Good morning fellas. Swaggy is back with a Sunday morning read and summary of unusual options activity for the week. I've highlighted some plays that came across as unusual based on how far OTM the bet was, the premium paid, and the volume of contracts in the play. If you want to check out additional tickers for yourself, you can scan the [unusual option flow tracker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) that I use at your liking (it's free).\n\n**ADBE \u2013 Adobe**\n\nSaw a bullish position in ADBE being opened with a debit spread. My scanner missed the long leg being opened, but I managed to catch the play by digging deeper. I\u2019ve added the OI from Yahoo Finance so you can see the contracts. Stock is currently sitting at $450 after Friday\u2019s -3% move. The debit spread was in October\u2019s $450 strike (long leg) and sold the $490 strike (short leg). Earnings aren\u2019t until September 15.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5zwew1t8zf51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeb0137a19b57af372a8bc574686146ec796933b\n\n**CNK \u2013 Cinemark**\n\nA bit of an unusual ticker for unusual activity. Cinemark saw some pretty heavy call buying on Friday. The stock has been on a bit of a run recently. One player bought calls 80% OTM for the $20 strike (stock is currently $11). This play was only $55k, but highly suspect with how far out the money they went. The play has an expiration date for September 18. I\u2019ve attached Yahoo Finance option chain for August 21 so you can see the heavy volume in the near OTM strikes. This stock typically does not have high volume with options.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfl6sgou8zf51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c240cd54686a66f589a3733cc3a44437c29467d\n\n**FB \u2013 Facebook**\n\nFacebook had a huge melt up Thursday and Friday. Volume on option activity was well above the average for the last 2 weeks. Saw a good amount of CALL buying with some CALL selling far OTM as well. Most of the call selling (potentially covered calls?) were done with expirations in the next 1-3 weeks. The call buying had expirations toward the end of the year and even into 2021. Long-term bullish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h59saplv8zf51.png?width=2856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b36f92032e3c7444ec4f41e4a83bc22468518393\n\n**MSFT \u2013 MicroTok**\n\nMicrosoft saw a massive bullish debit spread opened in November 2020 calls. 75,000 CALL contracts bought with the $220 strike while selling 75,000 CALL contracts at the $240 strike. Looks like the player/fund is expecting upside, but wanted to limit their downside by opening a spread. They have a max risk of $49 million with a max reward of $150 million if MSFT closes above $240 by November.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/804hwqew8zf51.png?width=2858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f76633f4b0db8220a1d1053daa8f54f5b796121\n\n**SDC \u2013 Smile Direct Club**\n\nAnother unusual ticker, this stock saw some unusual call buying recently. Two trades in particular were for next week\u2019s earnings report (August 12). Both trades are for $9 strike, which is currently in-the-money. When the trades were initiated the stock was trading at $8.82. Judging from the OI it looks like of the 16k contracts traded, only 10k are left on the Open Interest. He may have sold part of his position to collect profit, but left a lot on the table for next week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4ish39x8zf51.png?width=2740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08d9b879e6326f3a90959a6c2e9087da82ab9c1c\n\n**Snap \u2013 Snapchat**\n\nSnap saw extremely high volume of call options traded relative to it\u2019s average. Bullish flow out-weighed bearish flow by 3.5 to 1. Could be potential TikTok play as they expect the ban to increase their own share. There\u2019s was a lot of flow to go through on this ticker, so I\u2019m only mentioning that flow in general was above the average here and also more on the bullish side.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy8yygxx8zf51.png?width=2858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a02ccb95317ec638ac9566cbae050a86c6067d22\n\n**V \u2013 Visa**\n\nVisa saw some unusual option flow last week on Wednesday. That day alone the stock gapped up 2% and closed another 3% higher. Stock is currently trading at $196 and most of the call blocks had strikes of $202.5-$205. Visa generally does not have that much volume on option flow so it\u2019s always interesting to keep an eye on. If you look at the price action of the stock is has been in range-bound trading in the $190-$200 channel for almost 3 months now. Hit\u2019s $200 and drops back down to $190, then touches $190 and makes it\u2019s way back up to $200. Maybe some flow rolling through will be enough to have it break out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l7wovjqy8zf51.png?width=2860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92e352e915225089fb7e9f31524ed1fe04cbdefd",

In some ways I was privileged because I got to work with my dad in factories during an era where manufacturing technology started to change in drastic ways. It inspired me as a young pup which eventually lead me down the road of online mathematics-related education. Lucky for you, this includes game theory and finances.\n\nI write these DD's because I believe I have an enormous advantage in the current climate. I love to distribute knowledge, love the process of learning and I consider it one of my hobbies.\n\nI self-taught myself serverless and cloud computing technologies while I was in school and moved to California to pursue building my dream company in education technology. It also appears that the US is shifting toward increased Mexican trade, which I understand quite closely and have written about before.\n\nI love education and I love teaching - it is my passion. The intent here is to spur imagination and debate on the subject. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as an Education Company\n\n[Compliance is king](https://preview.redd.it/mil0bshb4qe51.png?width=2782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b42c5173e74ab83bd9cc38b115796a772c6d5b43)\n\nDropbox has a wonderful history introducing the masses to cloud computing applications. It solved a real file problem at the time - Apple and Microsoft files were not intuitive and there was a split in adoption. Academics of various ages needed an elegant solution and that was Dropbox. Think about that; users looked to solve a File Operating System problem using cloud computing in 2007. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDropbox is an education company. The best education technology companies are those that support the flow of education with high quality tooling rather than trying to replace it. Under this framework, I regularly invest in things like Autodesk, Adobe, and Dropbox as the companies have created an environment where IT school administrators will offer Creative Cloud, Autodesk, and Dropbox services under their student email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are familiar with the American education system, you know that this is an absurdly slow dinosaur when it comes to getting changes in motion. Technology, as a result, has to execute in rather phenomenal way to even have a chance in the education space. This is why you'll see awfully accessible and robust technology exist in the space - Windows, Macs, Chromebooks, Khan Academy, Symbolab, Dropbox, Adobe, Autodesk, Oracle, Blackboard, Canvas, etc. They are convenient tools that pay a lot of attention to things like ADA (disabilities) compliance and the like.\n\nThere is a revolution occurring in education in the form of disabilities pedagogy (the study of how to teach). Unlocking a lot of understanding in children with non-verbal autism, PTSD, and other serious learning challenges is an enormous frontier in teaching, learning, and understanding human development. \\*\\*These technologies do not get in the way and exist to assist.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # Dropbox as a Technical Product\n\nThe File &amp; Storage system in any given operating system will always be critically important to a user and the need will always be larger than you can anticipate. It extends from IT safety, banking, education, supercomputing, and so on. Can you evaluate the amount of storage and data needed after Machine Learning tools have grown for 10 years? It can not be determined, but it can be anticipated. Organizations that have built their own distributed infrastructure are advantaged. One can reasonably assume that these companies will distribute the building blocks to their products. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu67kf179qe51.png?width=2953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16a1ce179420a08750c5df246064f6eebdad30cc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: the CEO is currently in the Board of Directors of Facebook - who is also looking into workspace applications \\*\\*SPECIFICALLY TO SOLVE LONG TERM WORK-FROM-HOME COMMUNICATIONS\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workplace @ Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/vpcnvvru4qe51.png?width=3382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b3f6da6502c53102a73047c4b13977f3d498b1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Workspace @ Dropbox](https://preview.redd.it/rr462ns25qe51.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb2ba0e8e4fcc2bc24e82129bd0e209bee2d55d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is an enormous list of high-quality features that Dropbox offer due to its integration and infrastructure approach across multiple platforms:\n\n* \\- File security\n\n[banned by xi](https://preview.redd.it/mtg94ntd8qe51.png?width=1411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e62965952b2e9b876860beede13c106b59115f6)\n\n* \\- Signatures\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewaxdbdl8qe51.png?width=2791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce09ff54bad22b1920a33326478f69e11171a81d\n\n* \\- Computer vision document scanning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OCR](https://preview.redd.it/0551mtwz8qe51.png?width=2413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22ec6a63fe1fe5935dea0d7c743ea4a202f7a393)\n\n* \\- Workspace expectations (file syncing, large file transfers, organization,IT controls)\n* \\- Link generators to leak those sweet unreleased albums through zoom [https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/36pz554f6ds5eyu/Uzi%20Wheezy%20Zoom.wav.m4a?dl=0)\n* \\- File embedding \n* \\- Self-built storage infrastructure\n* \\- Deep industry wide integrations ranging from Zoom to Adobe\n* \\- Deep relationships in the education sector\n* \\- An unholy amount of other file solutions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hicx44ptdqe51.png?width=2547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc087db00260d31a49e3c33a32020848f9d91e05\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Compliance Advantage\n\nCloud computing is no longer a mystery, nor is it an open secret. It's a necessary supply chain tool, demanded, and growing faster than imaginations can keep up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work in the fintech industry. Let me tell you, compliance is everything. There is no Square, Paypal, Dropbox, Cloudflare, or any of your favorite important apps without various degrees of compliance. It would be much more helpful to view Square as an organization that distributes compliance to it's small businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \\- For Banking it's the Bank Secrecy Act and PATRIOT Act\n* \\- For Education it's FERPA\n* \\- For Healthcare it's HIPAA\n* \\- The list goes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean? It's means that mature cloud companies like Cloudflare, Dropbox, and the like are in an excellent positions to \\*\\*satisfy the legal means to continue to grow at scale\\*\\*. This is an extremely important factor to consider in the next 5 years. **Dropbox is not something people \"get\" -  it's something that they're \"given\".** For example, when I signed my name to accept my first career job - I was given Dropbox's HelloSign to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cloud Computing Hierarchy of needs](https://preview.redd.it/s3hfokxg5qe51.png?width=2981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ff1c87c8db5802df55d7f4156ee9b9f2e4f23c4)\n\n[Compliance advantage in education](https://preview.redd.it/s1qhcdxj5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34678980f20b163d47ec041add6defae67720038)\n\n[Another example of compliance-focused approaches](https://preview.redd.it/6nhym58n5qe51.png?width=3821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bc8101854eaa2a29f643f630024be629b23b9de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Monopoly Problem &amp; Integrations Competitors\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d1vs3oy5qe51.png?width=1835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81db898c8bd65364d7b2162ede4daecd5455547e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverybody knows it. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple is a monopoly cluster on data. Breaking them up is not a complex equation. Much like the death of a drug or religious cartel; there are many other viable candidates eager to steer the wheel in another direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is possible to compete against them, as evidence by organizations like Dropbox, Cloudflare, TikTok, Zoom, and the like. These smaller companies combining is what I consider the Unicorn Operating System. There opportunity is by distributing infrastructure to overwhelm larger companies that depend on acquisitions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is already happening. Zoom &amp; Dropbox distribute infrastructure.\n\n[Cloud Infrastructure is critical.](https://preview.redd.it/2entdn446qe51.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f486402438fd28382c109b7e3cc6c62483f99a1a)\n\n[Dropbox executing like a pioneer, similar to Paypal](https://preview.redd.it/wfli2evh6qe51.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7e0ac53777e81ff94736208493a873475eed8ef)\n\n# # Dropbox Financially\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7s08qzcdqe51.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9ad76618cd785e924f3e2203480903a9e681e0d\n\nThis part easy.

I get a lot of DMs asking about the activity, so if you want to read a bit about option flow, I made [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) describing how it works.\n\nIn addition, if you would like to check out the option flow tool and scan for yourself, here is the [option flow tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow).\n\nAs for unusual trades, it\u2019s been pretty quiet the last two weeks. Most flow is coming into big tech stocks and pumping them higher. I caught a few other smaller plays that I\u2019ll get into the details of here.\n\n**MSFT \u2013 Microsoft Corporation**\n\nMicrosoft has been a repeat name for some bullish flow in the last months. Looks like players have been opening bull call spreads with relatively medium-term expirations (end of the year) expecting the stock to continue it\u2019s slow rise up. The range of strike prices has been $215-$240. MSFT has been one of the companies looking to acquire TikTok in the latest rumors. Other names that have seen some similar flow last week were AMZN, FB, ADBE, and of course, AAPL.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmrkvz3e4ri51.png?width=2150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5128bc760d4ad4905cf479242fa4be52c7dfcd5\n\n**NVDA \u2013 NVIDIA Corporation**\n\nNVDA reported earnings last week and although they blew estimates out of the water, the stock remained flat post-earnings. NVDA demonstrated some high growth in their server market and overall they have been one of the best performing tech stonks. Flow has been mixed, but leaning on the bullish side. Overall activity has picked up greatly since last week as traders could be expecting another move up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1klzg6ze4ri51.png?width=2430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d91676e3f077ecd17e9a2f2d604de2ac8b64563\n\n**QCOM \u2013 QUALCOMM Incorporated**\n\nQCOM is another semi-conductor company that has seen a good run over the last several months. Players placed bets that the company would continue it\u2019s steady rise up as demand for chips in a more data-driven world are becoming the new norm. A lot of calls were traded with strikes in the $105-$120 range. These mostly have expirations from November to January 2021, so they are mid-term in the timeframes and expectations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rv6wpktf4ri51.png?width=1610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f5f1ed70da42174709714410765d64535b69f56\n\n**ORCL \u2013 Oracle Corporation**\n\nORCL has seen an uptick in activity on the bullish side. Rumors are they are making a bid for the TikTok acquisition as well. ORCL\u2019s stock price has been somewhat stagnant over the last several months and they didn\u2019t rally as hard as the rest of big tech from the March lows. The option flow might indicate a bullish move in the future for this stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6njzexg4ri51.png?width=2420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fcb092d4b6735bb223c38bedc6fff892e0e33f7\n\n**LYFT \u2013 Lyft Inc**\n\nLYFT and UBER have shut down service in California due to a new ruling that would require them to treat independent contractors as employees with benefits moving forward. Their rebuttal was to simply shut-down service and put the pressure back on the government to make their next move. Soon it will show that these ride-sharing companies have become a staple in our societal culture as they have made our lives so much easier. A whole slew of some pretty large calls were opened last week that was caught as bullish flow. I\u2019m not sure what the catalyst would be here, maybe it\u2019s because the stock is near the lows and shutting down service actually induces less losses on the company. Who knows.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pxz92li4ri51.png?width=2020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5eed0add829b6b63c17a73322ccab635ca8d309\n\n**DLTR \u2013 Dollar Tree Inc**\n\nDollar Tree caught some unusual call volume last week. Looks like players are betting on a 10% gain in the stock price with the October strike. These bets weren\u2019t unusually large in size, but for a company like DLTR they were pretty significant. The plays were sweeps at the $108 strike in Sept 25/Oct 02 expirations. The stock has had a decent run over the last several months and the players are expecting another leg up soon. We\u2019ll see about this one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3dkhbkj4ri51.png?width=1902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1de6a827de4fd6572df1600de3f839783271624\n\n**CRM \u2013 Salesforce**\n\nCRM/Salesforce has been a hot stock recently. There was some bullish flow earlier this month and again into last week. My scanner picked up two long position, although in my opinion it looks like a spread was opened (still bullish). The spread was actually opened when the stock was trading at $197, and it is currently $10 higher at $207. The player bought to open 11,000 calls at the $200 strike and sold 11,000 calls at the $220 strike, paying $9 million for the position. They are already profitable on their position, but if CRM closes above $220 by February, they will have a net profit of $22 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkw6lpok4ri51.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cf3112c70a994a5724707e18b3376cb6490b43d\n\n**CZR \u2013 Caesars Entertainment Inc**\n\nCZR caught some bullish activity last week when players opened January and March 2021 calls. The stock has already had an unbelievable recovery from the March lows, but is still nowhere near the highs. Looks like as the country opens back up again (if it stays that way), they expect the company to continue it\u2019s good performance. Some of the bullish flow was put-selling, which suggests the stock will have already reached it\u2019s long-term bottom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzkpssol4ri51.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7978edf9012a3334d7978075da93bac94215fd1",

        "selftext": "I am choosing these stocks to discuss as they are all near the same price and have been on my watchlist for some time now. I am having great trouble picking one over another though and would like to hear some input. I\u2019ll start with my thoughts.\n\n\nNetflix\n\nWhile competing against many other streaming services, I simply cannot see them going anywhere or being beaten in the long run. Their Netflix Originals are far and away better than other streaming services\u2019 original productions, and they are rapidly expanding globally, tapping into a much larger market.\n\n\nAdobe\n\nThe company I know the least about but am strangely attracted to the most. Adobe sets the bar for video creation and editing and has a very impressive chart and balance sheet. I am worried about growth, though I do think if they successfully tap into cloud computing more they will substantially rise. \n\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia\u2019s GPUs are so far advanced that it poses as barriers to entry for other competitors, with these companies settling for having the \u201cbest\u201d middle or lower tier GPUs. Nvidia also stands as an industry leader and analyst pick to develop and perfect autonomous driving technology.",

I felt closer expiration is safer, as the price cant move too much in 2 days... Thoughts ?! Also, I feel like with spreads, you need to hold on to them till close to expiry, due to extrinsic value still built inside of them, that you wont be able to capture. For instance, in TOS, the purple curve is today and the blue line is at expiry, and the blue line is always more profit than the purple curve. Thanks!!!!!! Also, is it a good idea to hold a spread to expiry? Why is assignment such a bad thing. On tastyworks it costs 5 dollars to excersize an option contract... What is such a big deal about worrying about assignment and closing out early... Thanks",
