        "selftext": "For all of you that spent today FOMOing into $DBX, listen up. Although they have recovered well from their COVID low, $BOX has plenty of room to run and this may finally be the chance for some of you to make a play better than just bending over for an IV crush. **TLDR: $BOX calls**\n\n#Overview\n\nEven amid all of the recent hype for $DBX, $BOX hasn't gotten the love that it deserves. Where $DBX spends most of their time making small money on the consumer front or on limited basic enterprise plans, $BOX focuses on playing with the big money (like the MMs that steal your weekly allowance). To give a bit of background, let's get into the background and then their latest 10-K.\n\n&gt;With our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud content management platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data\nprotection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations . . .  Our platform enables a broad set of business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers have access to their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\n\nAs a common theme, you'll continue to see this enterprise focus throughout, but it gets better.\n\n&gt;Our go-to-market strategy is focused on selling our cloud content management platform as a solution for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities, leveraging our product suite offerings, and driving high-value significant business outcomes for our customers . . .  We focus our efforts on larger enterprises, capitalizing on international growth, and utilizing our partner ecosystem, where most advantageous . . . We offer nearly 1,500 integrations with partners including Microsoft, IBM,\nSalesforce.com, Apple, Google, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Okta, Zoom and others, giving our users easy access to their content in Box without leaving these applications. \n\nSee some familiar names here? Those are the stocks that you've already missed the boat on. Beyond that, if you take a look at their site, you can look at some of the big names already using Box in their business: Morgan Stanley, GE, Intuit, AstraZeneca, etc. \n\nEven their CEO himself has been out trying to [tell everyone to hop on for the ride](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/box-ceo-aaron-levie-sees-cloud-growth-during-coronavirus), but hopefully the news coming out of the $DBX call was enough to convince you that it's viable. \n\nIf we get into their financials, you'll see strong revenue growth YoY from about $600M for the year ending 1/31/2019 to $700M on 1/31/2020. Although they have recorded a net loss each year, it's primarily driven by sales and marketing expense (45% revenue and declining YoY). When your product sells itself in this pandemic, that becomes a bit less of an issue. The balance sheet is a bit weak with limited cash and substantial A/R that may be problematic, but given the nature of their customer base and limited leverage, it shouldn't be as big of a concern.\n\nIn terms of revenue generation, I'll direct you to their [Enterprise License Agreement](https://cloud.app.box.com/s/xec0gl0gqcgverpn2rw0r4kkzqycdsme). These are 3 year agreements which include implementation and full integration into the Box platform. Over the past couple of months, even a few large organizations signing up for these are going to make it rain tendies, but I'd bet you see massive growth here. Because enterprise customers on broad platform integrations tend to be locked in for a while, it's going to lead to incredibly strong guidance.\n\n#Why now?\n\n$BOX reports earnings on 5/27, so for once you'll have the chance to get in *before* the big run up. As of now, premiums are still low and have plenty of room to run. The best part here is that because $BOX hates their accountants, their fiscal year ends on 1/31, so their quarterly earnings on 5/27 will include actual numbers through 4/30/20. Because of this, they'll have a good 2 months worth of pure COVID gains to showcase. Analysts are estimating about $0.05 EPS, but I'd bet on that being revised up and still beaten. The window may start to close as the market reacts to the $DBX earnings and detail from their conference call, but there's still time to get in tomorrow.\n\n#My Positions\n\n$BOX 6/19 17c\n\n$BOX 6/19 20c\n\nI entered started building the position earlier today and am already up about 20%, but I plan to hold over the next couple of weeks and use any dips as an opportunity to add more. As always, do your own research and mind your personal risk tolerance.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 18th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks could be stuck in a range until there\u2019s more proof reopenings are reviving the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/stocks-could-be-stuck-in-a-range-until-theres-more-proof-reopenings-are-reviving-the-economy.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Coming off a volatile week, analysts expect stocks to continue navigating choppy trading as investors try to build a view of what the economy will look like once states reopen.\n*****\n&gt; Recent data on April employment and consumer spending show the worst declines in post-World War II America. More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.\n*****\n&gt; Investors\u2019 focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government\u2019s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday night.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&amp;P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.\n*****\n&gt; # Home sweet home\n&gt; \u201cHousing is going to be important in that you\u2019ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be an issue. One of the key things we\u2019re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There\u2019s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren\u2019t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. \u201cThat\u2019s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarket reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. \u201cThe markets right now don\u2019t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Solvency concerns\n&gt; The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting kind of threshold here as we\u2019re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We\u2019re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That\u2019s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,\u201d Arone said.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. \u201cThe reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cLook out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the Fed\u2019s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we\u2019re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we\u2019re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don\u2019t have reason to believe that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a \u2018B\u2019 of \u2018B+\u2019 based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.\n*****\n&gt; But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that\u2019s going to be injected into peoples\u2019 arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; # Range bound\n&gt; For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It\u2019s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it\u2019s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cIf you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don\u2019t necessarily know if that\u2019s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they\u2019ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn\u2019t a ton of fuel for the downside there,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zvpr3QV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AG078t9.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/rZdWJAt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yC4IyAc.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HovLnbP.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hgJTyte.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iPw8MFr.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QBgwc4P.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QmygShJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9XPyDjX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1vFPlrt.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/joZmmeD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retail Sales Telling the Economy\u2019s Story\n\n&gt; Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.\n\n&gt; The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cOne of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAs the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there\u201d\n\n&gt; For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.\n\n&gt; While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.\n\n*****\n\n# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?\n\n&gt; As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&amp;P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While stocks look expensive on this metric\u2014one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs\u2014valuations may be getting too much attention.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile the return to 2019\u2019s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.\u201d\n\n&gt; So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:\n\n&gt; * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we\u2019ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year\u2019s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.\n&gt; * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock\u2019s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.\n&gt; * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.\n\n&gt; Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we\u2019re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.\n\n*****\n\n# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine\n\n&gt; Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&amp;P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.13.20-gold-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower\n\n&gt; Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4e19557c405d330902008fffb0a44c9/6eb13090bbcbbb54-1c/s500x750/43d5f31c2ba69a27a6253c19a4e3323b55287794.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves\n\n&gt; The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH.png))**\n\n&gt; While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH-C-vs-E.png))**\n\n&gt; One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, \"During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?\" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-News.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Remain On Guard\n\n&gt; In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors\u2019 portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.\n\n&gt; The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&amp;P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051420-Investor-Movement-Index.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$NAT** \n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$SE** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$BJ** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$TTWO** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$OAS** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$MCK** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$INSE** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FL** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$EXPE** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CBL** \n&gt; * **$DE** \n&gt; * **$KMDA** \n&gt; * **$SPLK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$EXP** \n&gt; * **$WB** \n&gt; * **$NIU** \n&gt; * **$HZN** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$TRVG** \n&gt; * **$IGT** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$OMP** \n&gt; * **$URBN** \n&gt; * **$SNPS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfbW3wN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/HmyOo14.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AyHFMTJ.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5ZcrgPO.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DWLvaBT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ClIq9Ts.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7SQEwiM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vhjzEL1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oJLC8tG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UVcv4sk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IsY2N2x.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Walmart Inc. $125.94\n&gt; **Walmart Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 18th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks could be stuck in a range until there\u2019s more proof reopenings are reviving the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/stocks-could-be-stuck-in-a-range-until-theres-more-proof-reopenings-are-reviving-the-economy.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Coming off a volatile week, analysts expect stocks to continue navigating choppy trading as investors try to build a view of what the economy will look like once states reopen.\n*****\n&gt; Recent data on April employment and consumer spending show the worst declines in post-World War II America. More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.\n*****\n&gt; Investors\u2019 focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government\u2019s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday night.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&amp;P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.\n*****\n&gt; # Home sweet home\n&gt; \u201cHousing is going to be important in that you\u2019ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be an issue. One of the key things we\u2019re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There\u2019s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren\u2019t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. \u201cThat\u2019s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarket reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. \u201cThe markets right now don\u2019t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Solvency concerns\n&gt; The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting kind of threshold here as we\u2019re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We\u2019re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That\u2019s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,\u201d Arone said.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. \u201cThe reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cLook out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the Fed\u2019s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we\u2019re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we\u2019re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don\u2019t have reason to believe that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a \u2018B\u2019 of \u2018B+\u2019 based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.\n*****\n&gt; But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that\u2019s going to be injected into peoples\u2019 arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; # Range bound\n&gt; For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It\u2019s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it\u2019s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cIf you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don\u2019t necessarily know if that\u2019s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they\u2019ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn\u2019t a ton of fuel for the downside there,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zvpr3QV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AG078t9.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/rZdWJAt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yC4IyAc.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HovLnbP.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hgJTyte.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iPw8MFr.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QBgwc4P.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QmygShJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9XPyDjX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1vFPlrt.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/joZmmeD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retail Sales Telling the Economy\u2019s Story\n\n&gt; Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.\n\n&gt; The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cOne of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAs the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there\u201d\n\n&gt; For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.\n\n&gt; While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.\n\n*****\n\n# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?\n\n&gt; As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&amp;P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While stocks look expensive on this metric\u2014one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs\u2014valuations may be getting too much attention.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile the return to 2019\u2019s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.\u201d\n\n&gt; So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:\n\n&gt; * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we\u2019ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year\u2019s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.\n&gt; * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock\u2019s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.\n&gt; * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.\n\n&gt; Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we\u2019re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.\n\n*****\n\n# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine\n\n&gt; Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&amp;P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.13.20-gold-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower\n\n&gt; Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4e19557c405d330902008fffb0a44c9/6eb13090bbcbbb54-1c/s500x750/43d5f31c2ba69a27a6253c19a4e3323b55287794.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves\n\n&gt; The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH.png))**\n\n&gt; While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH-C-vs-E.png))**\n\n&gt; One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, \"During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?\" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-News.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Remain On Guard\n\n&gt; In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors\u2019 portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.\n\n&gt; The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&amp;P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051420-Investor-Movement-Index.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending May 15th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r19CK8HrH_c))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 5.17.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$NAT** \n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$SE** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$BJ** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$TTWO** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$OAS** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$MCK** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$INSE** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FL** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$EXPE** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CBL** \n&gt; * **$DE** \n&gt; * **$KMDA** \n&gt; * **$SPLK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$EXP** \n&gt; * **$WB** \n&gt; * **$NIU** \n&gt; * **$HZN** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$TRVG** \n&gt; * **$IGT** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$OMP** \n&gt; * **$URBN** \n&gt; * **$SNPS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfbW3wN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/HmyOo14.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AyHFMTJ.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5ZcrgPO.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DWLvaBT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ClIq9Ts.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7SQEwiM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vhjzEL1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oJLC8tG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UVcv4sk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IsY2N2x.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Walmart Inc. $125.94\n&gt; **Walmart Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 18th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks could be stuck in a range until there\u2019s more proof reopenings are reviving the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/stocks-could-be-stuck-in-a-range-until-theres-more-proof-reopenings-are-reviving-the-economy.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Coming off a volatile week, analysts expect stocks to continue navigating choppy trading as investors try to build a view of what the economy will look like once states reopen.\n*****\n&gt; Recent data on April employment and consumer spending show the worst declines in post-World War II America. More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.\n*****\n&gt; Investors\u2019 focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government\u2019s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday night.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&amp;P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.\n*****\n&gt; # Home sweet home\n&gt; \u201cHousing is going to be important in that you\u2019ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be an issue. One of the key things we\u2019re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There\u2019s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren\u2019t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. \u201cThat\u2019s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarket reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. \u201cThe markets right now don\u2019t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Solvency concerns\n&gt; The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting kind of threshold here as we\u2019re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We\u2019re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,\u201d said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That\u2019s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,\u201d Arone said.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. \u201cThe reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cLook out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the Fed\u2019s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we\u2019re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we\u2019re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don\u2019t have reason to believe that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a \u2018B\u2019 of \u2018B+\u2019 based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.\n*****\n&gt; But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that\u2019s going to be injected into peoples\u2019 arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; # Range bound\n&gt; For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It\u2019s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOn a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it\u2019s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cIf you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don\u2019t necessarily know if that\u2019s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPart of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they\u2019ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn\u2019t a ton of fuel for the downside there,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zvpr3QV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AG078t9.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/rZdWJAt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yC4IyAc.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HovLnbP.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hgJTyte.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iPw8MFr.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QBgwc4P.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QmygShJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9XPyDjX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1vFPlrt.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/joZmmeD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retail Sales Telling the Economy\u2019s Story\n\n&gt; Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.\n\n&gt; The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cOne of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAs the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there\u201d\n\n&gt; For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.\n\n&gt; While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.\n\n*****\n\n# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?\n\n&gt; As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&amp;P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While stocks look expensive on this metric\u2014one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs\u2014valuations may be getting too much attention.\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cWhile the return to 2019\u2019s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.\u201d\n\n&gt; So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:\n\n&gt; * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we\u2019ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year\u2019s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.\n&gt; * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock\u2019s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.\n&gt; * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.\n\n&gt; Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we\u2019re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.\n\n*****\n\n# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine\n\n&gt; Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&amp;P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.\n\n&gt; \u201cFrom COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.13.20-gold-chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower\n\n&gt; Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4e19557c405d330902008fffb0a44c9/6eb13090bbcbbb54-1c/s500x750/43d5f31c2ba69a27a6253c19a4e3323b55287794.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves\n\n&gt; The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH.png))**\n\n&gt; While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH-C-vs-E.png))**\n\n&gt; One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, \"During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?\" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-News.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Remain On Guard\n\n&gt; In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors\u2019 portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.\n\n&gt; The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&amp;P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051420-Investor-Movement-Index.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$BABA** \n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$NAT** \n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$SE** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$BJ** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$TTWO** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$OAS** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$MCK** \n&gt; * **$SOGO** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$INSE** \n&gt; * **$SOHU** \n&gt; * **$FL** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$EXPE** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CBL** \n&gt; * **$DE** \n&gt; * **$KMDA** \n&gt; * **$SPLK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$EXP** \n&gt; * **$WB** \n&gt; * **$NIU** \n&gt; * **$HZN** \n&gt; * **$TNK** \n&gt; * **$TRVG** \n&gt; * **$IGT** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$OMP** \n&gt; * **$URBN** \n&gt; * **$SNPS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/SUxpLyG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfbW3wN.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/HmyOo14.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AyHFMTJ.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5ZcrgPO.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DWLvaBT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ClIq9Ts.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7SQEwiM.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vhjzEL1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oJLC8tG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UVcv4sk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IsY2N2x.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.22.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Walmart Inc. $125.94\n&gt; **Walmart Inc.
