        "selftext": "By Al Root \n\nThe short squeeze that continues to send shares of GameStop higher has spread to other small capitalization stocks with high short interest. And while it would be more difficult for this kind of trading to spread to large capitalization stocks, there are some that share similar characteristics with those that popped. \n\nHigh short interest is, essentially, a high percentage of total shares available for trading borrowed and sold by bearish investors betting on price declines. It can exacerbate a stock's price rise in a short squeeze because investors like hedge funds, who for the most part are active short sellers, have to buy more shares to cover bets as losses mount. That's what happened when traders targeted GameStop (ticker: GME) and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), whose short interest is far above the average short interest for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&amp;P 500. \n\nGoldman Sachs publishes a report that looks at the holdings of 814 hedge funds with $2.4 trillion of gross equity positions. As of the start of the fourth quarter 2020, the most recent report available, 10 of the stocks Goldman calls \"very important short positions\" for hedge funds with the highest short interest included: C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Aon (AON), Duke Energy (DUK), Analog Devices (ADI), Kroger (KR), Simon Property (SPG), Hormel Foods (HRL), Willis Towers Watson (WLTW) and Chipotle Mexican Grille (CMG).\n\nThose are not small capitalization stocks like GameStop. GameStop is worth more than $24 billion as of Wednesday's closing price, but six months ago it was valued at less than $300 million. The average market cap of Goldman's group is about $44 billion. The least valuable company is Willis Towers Watson with a $26 billion market cap. \n\nThe short interest in these 10 doesn't compare with stocks such as GameStop or Bed Bath and Beyond, either. The average percentage of stock available to trade sold short in the 10 stocks is about 7%. Short interest in Bed Bath and Beyond is about 67%. \n\nLower short interest limits the potential for a big move. But there are rumblings of a squeeze. The average gain in the 10 VISP stocks over the past five trading days is about 1.2%. The S&amp;P 500 is down about 2.6% over the same span. \n\nIf fallout from the GameStop squeeze continues, the impact could spread to those 10 stocks. Kroger and Hormel shares are already up more than others, by 17% and 13%, respectively, over the past five days. That's because losses piling up for hedge funds can cause them to sell long positions. It also means they may have to cover short positions, the trading action that is causing more intense short squeezes like GameStop's. \n\nGains like GameStop are unlikely for those stocks. Still, nothing seems to be off the table these days. \n\nJanuary 28, 2021 09:24 ET (14:24 GMT) Copyright (c) 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. Story ID: 20210128DN009398",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, January 6, 2020**\n\nAfter climbing throughout the day, stocks pulled back in the last few hours of the session as turmoil in Washington D.C. escalated. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.56% up, the Dow Jones (DIA) 1.43% up, and the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.39% down.\n\nToday, as lawmakers debated President-Elect Biden\u2019s election victory, protesters in support of Donald Trump broke through the barricades and flooded the Capitol Building. In response, the building was placed under lockdown and Trump deployed the national guard and other law enforcement agencies to control the chaos. According to the Associated Press, one person was shot in a violent clash with the police. The unnamed person was rushed to the hospital, though their condition is not known. Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a city-wide curfew from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m.\n\nIn Georgia, Democratic Raphel Warnock defeated incumbent Kelly Koeffler to win one of the two Senate seats in the state. This gives Democrats 49 seats to the Republicans 50, with one seat still hanging in the balance. The race between incumbent Republican David Perdue and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff remains too close to call at the time of writing and will decide which party has the majority position. Remember, in the case of a 50/50 tie, the Vice-President (Kamala Harris after January 20) casts the tie-breaking vote. \n\nAs of Monday morning, the first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine had been given to more than 4.5 million people in the U.S., far below the Trump Administration promise of vaccinating 20 million Americans by years-end. Dr. Anthony Fauci said President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s goal of ramping up distribution to vaccinate 100 million people in his first 100 days was a \u201crealistic goal,\u201d according to an interview with ABC on Sunday. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The New York Stock Exchange announced it would delist three Chinese telecommunication companies in an effort to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order from November banning U.S. investment in companies that were said to support China\u2019s military. The companies are: China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom\n* European Union\u2019s drug regulators approved Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, making it the second available in the bloc\n* U.S. officials are considering delisting Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) from the stock market, according people familiar with the matter. (Reported in an article by Benzinga)\n* According to a report, the recent SolarWinds (SWI) hack affected the US Department of Justice.\n* NIO has entered into a contract with battery supplier CATL for procuring a production line of lithium iron phosphate batteries for cheaper vehicles, Chinese media reported.\n* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by Keycorp from $160 to $175 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "I've bought ADI several times in 2020 and am currently holding a 13%+ position. What are thoughts on whether or not it is a legitimate 5G / semi stock compared to it's competitors? What else is to be considered in relation to its earnings and so forth? I am trying to grow past just letting this go for a 13% profit because, as far as I can tell, my understanding (as layman's as it may be) of the company's role in the world and their earnings line up to make it an optimal long term prospect. \n\nASML, being a 200B market cap, whose niche role in the chip market is something I'm choosing to hang my hat on and take as truth, potential competitor interference considered, is something that seems very attractive to hold long term. I would like to garner conviction behind the 100-500B companie's younger cousins. \n\nFor instance, my broker purchased salesforce earlier in 2020, and I've been looking at their 50B younger brother, WDAY, and wondering as I go forward in conjunction with the market/what my broker is doing,  how it is safe to make some of these \"risky\" medium-long term moves on companies that are considered small. \n\nBeing a new investor, please pardon my unavoidable short-sightedness. Definitely trying to attain some sense of long  term consistency here. Switched a lot of things around prematurely in 2020 (my first year) and want to make sounder, longer choices in the future.",

        "selftext": "I trade semiconductor vol because the options are liquid despite their core businesses perplexing most of the middle-aged lacrosse bros on Wall Street. The basic idea of my most recent trade is to get long gamma and express a view on relative valuation spread by buying a call on INTC and buying a put on AMD, while also expressing a bullish view on legacy lithography machines by buying a call on CAJ into their earnings print.\n\nHere's the trade that I am carrying into AMD and CAJ earnings this week, with roughly equal amounts of premium allocated to each:\n\n* Long INTC 05Feb 56c\n* Long AMD 05Feb 89.5p\n* Long CAJ Feb 22.5c\n\n|*Name*|*Earnings Date*|*Implied Move for AMD earnings*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|INTC|[Last Thursday PM](https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1439/intel-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-financial)|3.2%|\n|AMD|[26Jan PM](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/987/amd-to-report-fourth-quarter-fiscal-year-2020-financial)|9.9%|\n|CAJ|[28Jan 3PM Tokyo](https://global.canon/en/ir/calendar/)|5.3%|\n\nThis trade is long delta overall but somewhat agnostic to overall sector valuation; if the floor falls out of the whole market, it is protected by long skew and long gamma. However, the inverse correlation of the AMD-INTC pair has been very strong in the past 10 trading days or so, so ignoring general market moves I expect the AMD-INTC spread to either widen or tighten on AMD's earnings print. This trade sells growth versus buying value within a very specific sub-sector. The CAJ component seems like a wildcard but it's a targeted play on lithography; I'll address that.\n\nAMD and Intel have become matched competitors in the CPU space. A few years back, Intel's over-eagerness to roll out the 10nm process node, combined with a slavish obsession with Moore's Law, caused them to avoid waiting for upcoming technologies that would have made their work much easier. As a result, [Intel ate 10nm shit](https://www.eetimes.com/intels-10nm-node-past-present-and-future/).\n\nAMD has gobbled up market share over the past several quarters, and Intel's most recent numbers show a decline in the Data-Center Group, indicating that the market share attrition may not be constrained to the consumer market. AMD stock has enjoyed a six-year bull market that began after Silver Lake attempted to buy a large chunk of equity and restructure the company; [ultimately, the Silver Lake deal didn't materialize](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/215353-amd-talks-with-private-equity-firm-silver-lake-fell-through-report), but the stock is up 4400% now versus where it was at that time. AMD is fabless, which means that their chips aren't made in-house, but rather by pure-play foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\nIn terms of performance, Intel's 10nm is roughly comparable to Taiwan Semiconductor's 7nm. Similarly,  Intel's upcoming 7nm is roughly comparable to Taiwan Semiconductor's 5nm. As you may know, [those numbers aren't direct measurements of transistor gate length](https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/). It's kind of like the iPhone 12 vs the Galaxy S21, where the two competing phones are from the same generation despite a difference in the numbers that each company uses to name them. Still, Intel has fallen behind by one node.\n\nRecently, [Third Point bought a stake in Intel and is pushing for a strategic reshaping of the company](https://www.yahoo.com/now/third-point-full-letter-intel-220753103.html), including the possible decoupling of Intel's foundry and design businesses, that is reminiscent of what AMD underwent in 2008 when it jettisoned GlobalFoundries to avoid bankruptcy. I think Third Point is smart to invest in Intel, but the strategic recommendations are foolish. After spinning off GlobalFoundries, AMD was a pariah stock for seven more years. AMD's renaissance came about largely due to market positivity regarding GPUs for parallel computing applications (in line with NVDA), and began with an earnings short squeeze in 2015. Promisingly, Intel has signed on a veteran engineer-manager-executive, a man whom [Intel assisted in obtaining an advanced academic education](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/pat-gelsinger-coming-home-to-intel-will-be-the-greatest-honor-of-my-career-) during his prior stint with the company, as CEO starting in the middle of February. Gelsinger understands the technology and -- having run VMWare as CEO -- he also understands the big customers.\n\nNowadays, AMD is a crowded long. INTC has been on the ropes in part because [pundits who don't understand the sector tell investors that there's no reason to buy the stock](https://youtu.be/lQvkjJW7wYk?t=284). True, AMD is an amazing company run by brilliant people, arguably a David that has grown to be Goliath's equal through decades of passion and perseverance. Even so, looking at the multiple spread between INTC (P/E 11) and AMD (P/E 130), it's hard to explain the width of that spread purely by blaming Intel's fabrication business (which is very much alive) or loss of market share (the whole market is growing and INTC is still the largest player).\n\nDespite the challenges presented by M1 and Zen 3, Intel is still king for fully-specced flagship notebooks if you look at who moves product; for example, [Dell's XPS13 uses 11th-Gen Intel](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/help-me-choose/cp/hmc-intel-processor-xps), [Apple's Macbook Pro 13 uses 10th-Gen Intel](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP819?locale=en_US), and [Lenovo's upcoming Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen9 uses 11th-Gen Intel](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/coming-soon/X1-Carbon-G9/p/22TP2X1X1C9). AMD has copycatted some of Intel's strategic moves, notably [acquiring Xilinx for $35B a few years after Intel bought Altera for $17B](https://semiengineering.com/amd-wants-an-fpga-company-too/). (Xilinx and Altera were the two major producers of FPGAs, chips that can alter their logic structure based on instructions from the end user.)\n\nIntel also dominates the server market with something in the ballpark of [90% market share despite losing ground](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/318217-amd-arm-both-increased-their-server-market-share-in-q3-2020) to the competition.\n\nAny move that Intel makes to outsource chips to Taiwan Semiconductor's 5nm process would put pressure on gross margins for Apple and AMD, because [more competition for 5nm fab allocation reduces availability](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-prioritizing-apple-consoles) and eventually drives prices higher. That's an aggressive move in today's high-demand fab environment. Intel putting some CPUs on Taiwan Semiconductor's 5nm process doesn't mean Intel has given up on its own 7nm, but rather that Intel wants to suck oxygen out of the room where its competitors breathe, while it gets its own technology ready for prime time. Also, AMD is an important customer for TSMC, but if their allocation of TSMC fab capacity undershoots demand, then my assumption is that AMD would have to compete with other important TSMC customers for whatever additional capacity they attempt to book. INTC may not have this problem because it's an IDM.\n\nMy view is that Taiwan Semiconductor's [5nm isn't the central driver of the semiconductor market right now; it made up only 20% of the company's wafer revenue](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/14/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited/) in the most recent quarter, and semiconductor demand nowadays is overwhelming across the board. Surprisingly, the present shortage is not entirely due to work-from-home and distance learning. The legacy end of the market, ie 22nm and larger, is [a more reasonable choice for automotive applications and was actually experiencing overcapacity prior to the pandemic](https://semiengineering.com/foundries-prepare-for-battle-at-22nm/). Even [Bosch, which owns a number of its own fabs, may have to pay damages because it is unable to deliver some orders to automakers](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-chips/volkswagen-looks-to-claim-damages-from-suppliers-over-chip-shortages-idUSKBN29T09I) due to chip shortages. More broadly, [auto industry experts say that chips are hard to find across the board](https://barrons.com/articles/auto-chip-shortage-will-slow-down-car-makers-analog-devices-ceo-says-51610499262) \\-- including chips fabricated on legacy process nodes. [Automakers are scrambling to acquire](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35228204/microchip-shortage-car-production-disruption/) chips for conventional and electric vehicles, which have different functional requirements than a PC or smartphone. ASML (which dominates the semiconductor lithography machinery market with 80+% market share) stated last quarter that they had excess inventory in anticipation of greater demand, and this quarter they shipped 9 EUV machines and booked 6 net orders for future EUV shipments, but those leading-edge machines aren't particularly critical for production of devices like control units and power ICs. ASML saw the demand coming, but in contrast the back end of the market got caught off guard.\n\nIn other words, the semiconductor market requires greater *legacy* process node production (again, 22nm and above) right now. [Toyota, Ford, Nissan, and Fiat-Chrysler are cutting production](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-honda-output/chip-shortage-forces-ford-toyota-nissan-fca-to-cut-vehicle-production-idUSKBN29D1NF) because they need more bread-and-butter semiconductors to do basic important things like run traction control systems and tell the injectors how much fuel to deliver. In my view, the semiconductor shortage at legacy process nodes is only going to get more relevant as time passes and electric vehicles become more and more mainstream. Compound the electrification of the auto market with the pandemic boom in auto sales, and it's easy to imagine a resurgence of chip production at legacy process nodes. It's not hard to imagine that automakers and parts suppliers will buy some of their own chip machinery for upcoming EVs, but it takes years to set up a new fab so there will be broad-based demand for all the technologies involved. My bet is that some of the demand has already progressed into the order books of makers of semiconductor machinery -- in other words, the middle-aged lacrosse bros will be sifting through the semiconductor equipment names pretty soon.\n\nEnter Canon. Despite [recent improvements in demand for mirrorless cameras and inkjet printers](https://global.canon/en/ir/release/2021/p2021jan14e.pdf), this company has been forgotten by investors for many reasons, but it makes DUV (Deep UV, in other words not as low wavelength as EUV) machines too. Think of lithography machines as room-sized laser printers for semiconductors. They employ very precise optics, and that's why optics manufacturers like Canon are involved ([ASML works with Zeiss](https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/zeiss-and-asml-strengthen-partnership-for-next-generation-of-euv-lithography-(54430))). Canon only holds about 5% of the lithography machine market. One difference between EUV and DUV is that you can't use lenses for EUV because the lens glass would absorb all the light, so you have to use extremely specialized mirrors (which still absorb 90+% of the light) instead. Canon's DUV machines are not as good as ASML's DUV machines, and right now ASML is the only supplier of EUV. Canon isn't a dedicated lithography house, but it makes about 20% of its profits from the segment that makes and sells photolithography equipment.\n\nDUV lithography is not an appropriate tool for the newest process nodes like TSMC's 5nm. It uses lasers from wavelengths (248nm, 198nm, 157nm) that can't reliably be resolved to features in the 5nm range even if you use a bunch of tricks (aka Resolution Enhancement Techniques). In contrast, EUV employs 13.5 nm lasers that can do so, in theory down to 6.75nm (half the wavelength) without RETs.\n\nEUV and the leading-edge nodes enabled by it, eg Taiwan Semiconductor's 5nm process, are amazing for mobile devices because they fit lots of little units onto a single silicon wafer (higher wafer efficiency), and produce chips that use less power per unit of computation (better battery life and less heat generation). All of this is important for CPUs, GPUs, and RAM, but extremely tiny features are not necessary for every semiconductor application. Power electronics, control systems, and other chips that you might find on a car or truck have different functional requirements from an iPad or PS5. There's good money to be made using legacy semiconductor processes; by all appearances, GlobalFoundries (remember them?) doesn't even have plans to go down into the single-digit process nodes for the time being, with its leading-edge node being [12LP+](https://www.eenewsanalog.com/news/globalfoundries-12lp-finfet-process-ready-production) after [having cancelled its 7nm plans](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13277/globalfoundries-stops-all-7nm-development) in 2018.\n\nI can't stress how big the impact of semiconductor demand from automakers has become. Imagine: several major automakers have slowed or stopped production just as [EVs are entering the mainstream](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/22/electric-vehicles-close-to-tipping-point-of-mass-adoption), and [even the aluminum market is feeling the effects](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alcoa-slides-warning-higher-costs-214731067.html). I think the market has overlooked DUV demand because, again, most people on Wall Street don't really understand the different products and technologies within the chip sector, and even those who were knowledgeable about the sector didn't foresee broad-based demand for legacy chips.\n\nCAJ trades at a 37 P/E. (Nikon is another name similarly involved in DUV, but I don't trade options on OTC stocks.) Last quarter, [Canon made 20.2% of its overall sales revenue from the business unit that includes lithography machines and other industrial devices](https://global.canon/en/ir/results/2020/rslt2020q3e.pdf). Given the fact that Canon has a mature lithography business with minority market share in the sector, the potential for market share expansion due to higher demand for DUV would really transform the company's role in the segment.\n\nIf the AMD/INTC pair gamma trade goes well, I may take it off and roll the premium into more CAJ calls.",

        "selftext": "Let's brainstorm this a little bit.  I'm sure most of you saw that snippet from 60 minutes (posted on WSB recently), saying, \"Amazon would have to sell every book being sold in the world today to justify its stock price.\" That was way back in the late 1990s when Amazon was just an on-line book store. \n\nSomeone else said, \"That's Tesla today.\" \n\nI'd like to know how. \n\nAmazon had a clear path to expand from selling books, to household gadgets, to literally everything and anything sold by anyone anywhere. Including things that didn't exist in the 1990s, like AWS cloud services (that \\*should\\* have gone to someone like Akamai or CSCO or MSFT, or Oracle or even freaking WalMart had a better information system infrastructure than Amazon had in the 1990s.)  Amazon dominating that segment was just a fluke. And currently the lion's share of its revenue too.\n\nAlso, I wanted an electric car but didn't want Tesla's goofy iPad-style interface system, among other things, so I took an old sports car and built my own EV. Guess what? EV's are not hard. Sure, mine is definitely not more efficient than a Tesla (or Bolt, or etc.) but I learned something important -- replacing the drivetrain and installing batteries was the easy part (granted, I have some electrical engineering experience -- but not much). Literally everything else about building a car was way, way, WAY harder. Companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, VW, etc. can \\*easily\\* outbuild Tesla, and highly efficient, high-torque electric motors and solid state batteries appear to be on their way to commodity status. \n\nSolar Panels, self-driving capability, yada, yada... I don't see how these can possibly match the scale of what Amazon did. Grid energy storage, merging with Space-X and using Starlink's Skynet as part of the self-driving hive-mind... maybe? \n\nWhat else could there be? Fully autonomous, self-managing houses? Is Tesla going to start selling phones that use Starlink, to fulfill the space Iridium tried to back in the 90's? \n\nHelp me understand how TSLA \\*might\\* live-up to its current stock price. I want to believe, but currently, I'm just not seeing it.",

Everything in this post is based on my personal opinion and open-source information. Please don't see this as any financial or investing advice. I have no positions in Okta at the moment.\n\n**OKTA - General Description**\n\nThe company can be seen as providing Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) and is one of the leading companies in the IDaaS market. Okta primarily focusses on 6 main industries: Healthcare, Public Sector, Education, Energy, Financial Services and Technology providing their services to more than 9400 small, medium and large enterprises worldwide.\n\nOkta's main product is the Okta Identity Cloud which is comprised of 6 platform services:\n\n    Directories: stores users and attributes\n    \n    Integrations: ensures that apps (currently 6500+) can connect to Okta\n    \n    Insights: aggregates, analyses and disseminates data from Okta and its partners\n    \n    Identity Engine: customizable access experiences like authorization, authentication and registration\n    \n    Workflows: automates identity-centric processes\n    \n    Devices: collects device identity and context\n\nThese platform services can be leveraged using Okta's products, API's and SDK's like:\n\n    Single Sign On\n    Universal Directory\n    Advanced Server Access\n    Adaptive Multi-actor Authentication\n    Lifecycle Management\n    Access Gateway\n    API Access Management\n    Developer\n    One App\n    Enterprise\n\n**Okta Integration Platform**\n\nThe biggest part that makes Okta a key player is the fact that they integrated 6500+ applications into their cloud and on-premises systems which ensure that on all aspects, an organization can secure their processes. They integrated:\n\n* Human Resources Information Systems like bambooHR and Workday\n* Network Security like Cisco, PaloAlto and Fortinet\n* Application Delivery Controllers like F5, Akamai and Citrix Netsclar\n* Security Analytics like Splunk, Rapid1, IBM QRadar\n* Cloud Access Security Brokers like Bitglass and McAfee\n* API Gateways like AWS, Google Cloud, Apigee\n* Identity Governance and Administration like SailPoint\n* ID Proofing like Acuant, Evident and Experian\n* Privileged Access Management like BeyondTrust and CyberArk\n* Endpoint Security and Management like IBM, MobileIron and VMware\n* Healthcare Technologies like Cerner and AthenaHealth\n* Protocol Based Custom Integrations like Radius, LDAP and SAML\n* Bot Detection like Arkose Labs, Shape and Perimeter\n* Customer Data Integrators like Segment\n* Email Security like ProofPoint\n* SaaS Management Platforms like BetterCloud and Intello\n\nI've made this list, to show how versatile and broad their product is. They ensure that their single product can be used for a multitude of cases within the Workforce Identity, Customer Identity and Access Management market segments.\n\n**How they make money**\n\nOkta's business model follows a SaaS-based delivery model in which business subscribe to Okta's services and pay a fee per user per month. Okta's subscription revenues in the 9 months ending 10/31/2020 jumped 50% YoY to $571.2M.\n\n**Financials &amp; Valuations (as of** [10/31/2020](https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-strong-third-quarter-results)**):**\n\n* Current Market Capitalization (as of 1/15/2021) - $32.75B\n* Total Revenue (3 months): $217,379,000\n* Total Revenue (9 months): $600,684,000\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 3 months: ($72,764,000) \u2013 Up from ($63,495,000)\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 9 months: ($190,526,00) \u2013 Up from ($158,441,000)\n* Cash on Hand: $2.945B\n\n**Growth &amp; Opportunities**\n\nOkta is one of the companies that greatly benefited from the lockdowns all over the world, and the subsequent rise in the need for identity and access management services triggered by the  work-from-home wave. The company's momentum will highly likely continue through fiscal 2021 and beyond, with more and more companies looking to ensure safe and secure work-from-home environments that protects companies, their employees and their customers. CFO Bill Losch said on the company's third-quarter [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings),  \"We remain confident that the factors that are driving our business today will continue to drive our business well into the future.\"\n\nJust recently, [Okta's products were made available in the AWS Marketplace](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201202005943/en/Okta-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Bring-the-Okta-Identity-Cloud-to-AWS-Marketplace). It is expected that this move will drive top-line growth.\n\nOkta estimates that it will end fiscal 2021 with revenue of about $822.5 million, an increase of 40% from the previous year, and that it will surpass $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2022. Although Okta isn't profitable yet, one of its pro's is that the free cash flow consistently stays on the plus side and makes up 19% of Okta's revenue. One of the most important contracts in this business are annual contracts. Okta gained 100 customers in Q3 with $100,000+ annual contracts, totaling over 1700 customers. The number of large enterprise contracts ($500,000+) grew 50% YoY to 320. These now represent 80% of Okta's annual contract values.\n\nAs president-elect Joe Biden will take office later this week, one of the most anticipated moves is an [increase in cyber security](https://buildbackbetter.gov/press-releases/statement-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-cybersecurity/) spending by the new administration. Putting Okta, among other big cyber security players, into an excellent playing field the coming years.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nMarch 3 is the expected Q4 earnings. Okta is in a good position to beat their ER once again.\n\n[18 Analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OKTA/analysis?p=OKTA) combined have an average price target of $262.44.17 (upside of \\~4%) with tops being at $313.\n\n**TL;DR Okta is in a great position within the Identity and Access Management market which makes the company one of the ideal high-growth stocks moving forward. Personally, I think it is worth taking a look at and most likely a stock that will pay off not only when Q4 Earnings are reported, but easily for the next 2 years at least.**",

        "selftext": "[https://youtu.be/\\_O-YtayUoiw](https://youtu.be/_O-YtayUoiw)\n\nTravis Kalanick Is an american businessman who built some of the most recognizable tech startups in the world. He built Scour, Red Swoosh and Uber and after leaving uber he started cloudkitchens. He was born in 1976 and grew up in Northridge, a suburb of Los Angeles. His parents had catholic and jewish background. He showed lots of interest towards computing when he was already vey young. He learned coding when he was just in middle school and, as a matter of fact, studied computer engineering at UCLA. While at UCLA, he helped develop Scour, a company that had a search engine but was mainly known for its peer to peer file sharing service. He dropped out in order to take part in this project. That was a tough time for him because while working at Scour he lived with the disoccupation subsidies. But they received a $250 billion copyright infringement lawsuit so they declared bankruptcy. He later started another venture called Red Swoosh which was another peer to peer file sharing company. Since he was seriously broke, he moved to India while developing Red Swoosh in order to cut his expenses. Red Swoosh finally was acquire by Akamai Technologies in 2007 for $19 million dollars. This made Travis a millionaire. In 2009 after a bad experience with a taxi cab Kalanick and his friend Garrett Carp, that I\u2019ll later cover, got the idea to create a cheaper way to find rides. Camp worked at the first prototype while Kalanick was a project supervisor. It was orginally called UberCab but later they changed the name into Uber. In 2010 Kalanick took the role of CEO at Uber. Kalanick started the service in San Francisco but later expanded in all of the United States and later to rest of the world. It was started for high end customers. It started with black cars only but when Lyft started its peer to peer ride app, Kalanick wanted a slice of the pie and raised hundreds of millions of dollars through venture and private equity funds like Google Ventures, now GV and Texas Pacific Group, also known as TPG. They used the money to create Uber X and take a chunk of the marketplace from Lyft. Uber tried to expand in different mobility sectors, started experimenting bike sharing, autonomous driving vehicles, boat rides and even helicopter rides. In 2014 they started Uber Eats, a food delivery service that is having a strong growth all around the globe. Uber started facing criticism because it became a very strong competitor to usual taxi cabs. It had privacy issues as well because the app continued to track people location even after the app was closed. It also faced criticism for not paying drivers enough. It was also accused by Google of stealing the self-driving technology. The company has also been charged for misleading drivers on possible earnings. Uber and Kalanick himself faced lots of criticism after an employee who left Uber accused the company of systemic sexual misconduct. Kalanick later, due to this, said he would step down as CEO at UBER and Dara Khosrowshahi was named as his successor. But Kalanick stayed on the board until the end of 2019, when he sold 90% of the shares he owned in the company. The company was listed on the NYSE in May, 2019. It struggled but it\u2019s still thriving thanks also thanks to the backing of SoftBank, the fund created by Masayoshi Son, which I\u2019ll soon cover so make sure to subscribe. But Kalanick already saw a big trend cominc, delivery food so he invested through his company City Storage Systems into UK company FoodStars, a dark kitchen company. A company that owns kitchens without restaurants. It only works with delivery. In the meantime Kalanick started a new company, CloudKitchens, also thanks to a $400 million investment received for Saudi Arabia Sovreign Fund and $300 million of his own money, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. He spends most of his time between Los Angeles and New York. He bought $36 million apartment in SoHo New York. He also started his own venture fund called 10-100 that is focused on investing in e-commerce companies in the US, China and India. He has not showed much interest in philanthropy yet but he has donated through the companies he managed.",
