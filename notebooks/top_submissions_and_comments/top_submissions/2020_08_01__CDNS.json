        "selftext": "In a recent post I did on AMD, some had expressed interest in a write-up on Cloudflare. I wasn\u2019t going to write anything since I am long NET, but then I saw Fastly up around 13% today ahead of its earnings on Wednesday. With both Cloudflare and Fastly reporting this week, I thought the timing was apt to compare these two as they\u2019ve pursued different approaches to building their networks. And I happen to believe that while Fastly\u2019s heavy focus on speed/performance does offer some advantages in the CDN market, the real opportunity in these names (as well as Akamai for that matter) is the edge computing market \u2013 not CDN.\n\nI think one of the major reasons why Fastly is up over 430% YTD and Cloudflare over 145% is because most analysts were slow to pick up on the full extent of the end market(s) these companies are exposed to. I also think there has been some conflation in terms of the technology. Even now, I see CDN and edge computing used interchangeably when they are not necessarily the same. While similar ideas in that they both leverage edge servers (servers placed at a closer geographical proximity to the end-user or device), the use-case is not necessarily the same. Think of a CDN more so as a particular application or use of edge computing. To this point, multiple CDN players (Akamai, LimeLight, CDNetworks) have made recent moves into the broader edge computing market. \n\nBroader is the keyword here, because whereas CDNs cache web content (videos, photos, etc. from a website to speed its \u201cdelivery\u201d to the site\u2019s visitor), the hype surrounding edge computing is more so tied to 5G and the Internet-of-Things rather than primarily websites or SaaS applications necessarily. To be more specific, the value proposition of IoT is the vast distribution of sensors and real-time *collection* of data. Positioning edge networks closer to the IoT devices can enable faster industrial or logistics solutions.\n\nThose familiar with Fastly will be aware that they offer (or offered) the fastest cold start times (this just means the time it takes for an application to start up and be responsive to user input) of any serverless network application (CDN or edge) at 35 microseconds. Fastly claims that they are the gold standard for speed and performance and superior to AWS, Azure, Google, and Cloudflare. This approach has been successful, especially in targeting large enterprise customers. Fastly has a much larger average customer size relative to Cloudflare. \n\nWhile Fastly has recently expanded their security offerings as they further develop their edge platform, Cloudflare's strategy from the onset has been to balance performance, speed, and flexibility. Why does this matter? The major drawback to edge computing is that it greatly increases attack vectors for network intrusion. 5G will enable an extremely rapid proliferation of IoT devices. According to the Telecommunications Industry Association, by 2022, more than half of all internet-connected devices will by IoT machines. And IoT device operators will absolutely prioritize security of their industrial and logistics applications, especially as most computing applications (websites, programs, etc.), are not really as sensitive to latency at the speeds we are talking \u2013 i.e. the user/operator can\u2019t actually discern the speed difference on their end. \n\nIoT operators (industrial, logistics, transportation companies) won\u2019t be focused on consumers doing e-commerce or going on Reddit. They will be collecting zettabytes of structured and unstructured data to *push upstream* so that they can manage their assets more efficiently and securely. Fastly\u2019s network utilizes fewer servers to increase efficiency and speed. Although that is great for Twitter, this lowers the network capacity to mitigate DDoS attacks (the most common IoT attack). Cloudflare has more points-of-presence and network capacity versus Fastly. This combined with their more expansive attack logs (Cloudflare services a far greater number of web properties than Fastly) and more mature security product portfolio, gives their network architecture numerous advantages for the edge computing market. This is all ignoring the fact that Cloudflare announced last week *zero nanosecond* cold start times for its edge computing platform which totally undercuts the Fastly speed advantage anyway. \n\nThe CDN market is larger today. Prior to COVID and the work-from-home demand boost, estimates tagged it at around $13.3bn. In comparison, the edge computing market was only $3.5bn in 2019 according to Grand View Research. Looking towards the future though? The CDN market is forecasted to hit $23bn plus by 2025, while the edge computing market is seen hitting $43bn or more in 2027. There have been recent reports that suggest the rise in the edge computing market over the next 10 years could even rival the growth in public cloud over the previous ten years (led by Amazon, Microsoft, Google). And Gartner believes that by 2025, three-quarters of enterprise-generated data will be created and processed at the edge. If you stop and think how much data has been created in 2020 versus just a few years ago, that is truly staggering growth. \n\nThe above comments gloss over the fact that there are also some very real reasons why a CTO or purchaser would select Cloudflare as a CDN over Fastly. The other big advantage Fastly has over Cloudflare (and Akamai) is it is *much* more customizable for developers. For web applications that are very high-level enterprise grade or extremely sensitive to latency, it absolutely makes sense to go with Fastly. However not all use-cases for a CDN require that level of customization, and there is quite the vertical learning curve for developers to learn the Fastly platform. Cloudflare also has more flexible pricing tiers (including a free tier) for customers who may not need the premium features. In short, there is a much wider range of use-cases that Cloudflare can cater to with its CDN platform relative to Fastly. I think this is evidenced by the fact that Cloudflare has far more customers (number not size) in addition to a much bigger developer community on Stackflow. \n\nThis all gives Cloudflare more potential to scale with its CDN customers and cross-sell its more diverse product portfolio. Again, Fastly certainly has a very strong presence in the large enterprise market. And for many, the performance and customization offered by Fastly will be a decisive factor when it comes to which CDN provider to choose. But I do think that Fastly has very much built itself to be the premium provider when a lot of customers are totally happy with a marginally slower cold start time if it means more flexibility on cost or ease-of-use.\n\nAt the end of the day, what this boils down to is which end market are you more bullish on: CDN or edge computing. For the record, I think over the next five years Fastly has a great opportunity to keep up the momentum. Its performance YTD would scare me a little bit in the immediate term because I think these levels assume continued growth acceleration or more guidance raises. But the CDN market is projected to keep growing at a healthy clip. And like I said, there are definitely some clear use cases for Fastly. \n\nI just happen to think that Cloudflare has a much, much, much higher long-term ceiling (thinking next 10-15 years) when you look at its natural advantages in the edge computing space and the enormous potential of that end market. Also of note, Cloudflare is slated to nearly double its global data center footprint over the next 3 years through its joint venture in China with JD.com. And whatever you think of China, its undeniable that there will be a data explosion there as internet penetration goes from the low 60% it is today to someday rival western countries. \n\nFastly is interesting, but when you look at the fact that Cloudflare has 77% gross margins compared to 57% for Fastly, you are ultimately paying a higher EV/revenue for slower growth, fewer revenues, one-fifth the cash, and significantly weaker margins. Good luck to all!",

        "selftext": "  \n\nI was introduced to options in 2005. \n\nA co-worker of mine, who happened to be a 9/11 Truther before that was a term, was all hyped up on the upcoming ER for Amgen. He went around the office on a manic high, telling everyone to buy short term OTM call options - or as we refer to them around these parts, FDs. \n\nAs part of our retirement plans, we each had Fidelity brokerage accounts. To enable options trading, however, you had to call Fidelity and answer questions about your level of financial smarts and how much money you had. The correct answers were, of course \"genius level\" and \"shitloads.\" I answered truthfully. My other coworkers did not. They got to options trading enabled. I did not.\n\nAmgen beat and some of these guys landed 8 baggers. My own officemate made $50k and promptly took his family to Disneyland. As you can imagine, I was dismayed that I missed out.\n\nFor the next few months, chasing the next big trade was all the rage, and our team could hardly get anything done. I got my account upgraded by answering the questions correctly, but every play the group made after Amgen was a loser. Because I never had that thrill of victory, I quickly lost interest, but the temptation to recapture those initial gains captivated some of the other guys. As the losses racked up, the trading group got smaller and smaller, eventually distilling down to the most degenerate off talking in the corner, the crazy Truther mumbling his false prophesies to his last few disciples. I lost about $1000 \u2013 which was no small change at that time in my life \u2013 but I know that some of the guys lost a lot more chasing that high.\n\nThat\u2019s still better than the snake oil the retail investment crowd is selling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor any market at any given time, Boggleheads and r/investing will tell you to just keep putting money in, no matter how badly you are getting fucked.\n\n*\u201c7% YoY in the market!\u201d* \n\n*\u201cThe greatest force in the universe is compound interest!\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIf you hold for the long term, you don\u2019t have to worry about volatility!\u201d*\n\nHere\u2019s the cold truth: the life advice Boomers give out is fucking outdated, designed for an analog world created by a Greatest Generation that coddled them, and that includes their financial advice as well.\n\nI am from the \u201c[Oregon Trail Generation](https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/)\u201d, the last slice of GenX that actually grew up with computers. We are the cohort that witnessed the death of the American Middle Class that the Internet Age and Globalization, entering the workforce just as the dot-com bubble finally put it out of its misery.\n\nWhen I was 3, my grandfather retired from Boeing after 35 years. They gave him a platinum plated set of draftsman\u2019s tools, a brass desk clock and a lifelong pension.\n\nWhen I was 19, my girlfriend\u2019s dad was a consultant for Boeing. His job was to dig up dirt on upcoming retirees so they could be fired to deprive them of that pension.\n\nI did the *thing,* that good old American Dream \u2013 marriage, house, car, kids. I did what the \u201cexperts\u201d tell you to do: save a slice of each paycheck for retirement, invest in a college plan, buy a house as a solid investment. \n\nHere I am barely middle-aged, and I have worked through three major financial crises since I entered the workforce.\n\nI\u2019ve chased a runaway housing market, lowering my parameters every month because the prices kept rising faster than I could make for a down payment.\n\nTwice, I have had my retirement account fleeced, then had to draw down what was left to keep a roof over my head - paying a penalty to do so. \n\nI have been so upside down on a mortgage I\u2019ve considered burning the house down.\n\nSo I am here to tell you firsthand that *Save, Buy, Hold and Diversify* will not help you when the whole market collapses and you find yourself in need of that money, that a house is just an investment that you can live in while it drops in value, and that *Dollar Cost Averaging* is another way of saying *Getting Cucked.*\n\nI say, if you are going to make or lose 50% in the next 10 years, you may as well make or lose that 50% in the next 10 *hours.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn some ways, younger Millennials and Zoomers are better equipped to face these facts than us older folks. If you came of age during the GFC or later, you understand that the game is rigged. All that bailout money is moving around the market while you are struggling to make minimum wage in the Uber Eats gig economy. Unlike those of us who grew up in more stable times, you know in your bones the halcyon days - the ones you've only ever heard about - about are never coming back. \n\nNot for everybody, at any rate.\n\nSo enters RobinHood, and it drives the financial pundits absolutely berserk. Who are these fucking kids YOLOing on HTZ? Don\u2019t they know they are supposed to be investing that money into a passive index fund, or even better, one of those retirement-date funds with the massive expense ratios? It\u2019s fucking up the game for the rest of us! \n\nI have traded options on and off for years in the hopes of making a little pocket money. Fact is, when commissions were $8-$20 per trade (plus a fee per contract), there was no way a small-time retail investor could participate meaningfully. With free or no commissions, the calculus has changed, lowering the bar of entry for smaller investors who can enter and exit a position at any time with only the bid-ask spread the main concern.\n\nBoomers created a monster, and they have only themselves to blame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike many of you, when March hit, I jumped in to puts and lost a bunch of money. This is because I was using an old way of thinking about options, the only one available to small-time retail traders just a few years ago: \u201cI hope that this security makes a huge break in a particular direction.\u201d \n\nAfter this loss and subsequent reflection, I determined that the money was there to be had, just that I was taking the wrong approach. I developed a new strategy, one that takes advantage of the simple fact that I can enter and exit a position without significant commission costs. I began to diversify my targets, and enter smaller positions on those targets, so that I didn\u2019t have everything riding on one or two plays. I developed exit strategies - and followed them! \u2013 so that I could take my wins or cut my losses quickly and move on to the next trade. \n\nAnd most importantly, I made it a point to withdraw my gains, if any, at the end of every week.\n\nSince April, I have executed no less than 20 trades per week if you count option expiry. In 15 weeks, I have doubled my account value. Not because of some one-off spectacular play or because I\u2019ve been a bull a bull market. In fact, I\u2019m a bear, but using a pretty neutral strategy. I doubled my money because I adapted to this new trading climate, found what works for me, and simply stuck to it.\n\nDo I think that makes me some some sort of fucking genius? Absolutely not. I\u2019ve made some smart, conservative plays that turned really goddamned sour. I\u2019ve made some truly retarded plays that turned out great. I\u2019ve had good weeks, bad weeks, and weeks that amounted to an incredibly stressful waste of time. I still make a bunch of mistakes - weekly, if not daily. \n\nI am still prepared \u2013 waiting, even \u2013 for my whole account to get wiped out due to a cacophony of bad plays. In the end, these are all gut decisions. Do I feel good about this? For each of them, only time reveals if I am right.\n\nBut if I have taken one thing away from what I have learned so far this year, it is this: *anybody can make rent money in the equities market now*. You do not have to have a massive account to overcome the burden of commissions, or have a huge investment in dividend stocks to realize a gains-based income. And thank God for that, because the job market is not going to save you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the gain porn here is enough to make a man drool, and the loss porn is enough to make his balls retract into his stomach. Just understand those are always one-sided directional plays. It\u2019s all-in on a single ticker, a true YOLO, not unlike putting it on black at the roulette table. It\u2019s easy to get caught up looking at the massive gains and get stars in your eyes.\n\nBut forget the lambo and the gold-plated yacht for a moment and consider something more immediate, such as: \u201ccould I pay this month\u2019s phone bill with my gains?\u201d With the money you can pare off into a brokerage account, is it possible to avoid spending the the money you make doing whatever it is you do for someone else and make your phone service \u201cfree\u201d?\n\nFor example, if you have $1000 and you make a reasonably conservative play with an exit strategy of $100 gain and $100 loss (such as a deep OTM 45DTE bull credit spread on a decent stock that\u2019s been beaten up recently, with a hard exit 21DTE), the likelihood is very high. It is not guaranteed \u2013 you may end up down $100 from where you started. But what *is* guaranteed is that you will have to spend 8 hours flipping burgers or whatever at $12.50 an hour to make that $100 if you don't. (Yes, I know, *taxes \u2013* the point still stands).\n\nWhen you finally get to take that $100 out and pay the phone bill with it, it becomes very, very real. \n\nImagine getting to a point where your trading gains pay for the things you *need*, so you can spend the money you earn with your blood sweat and tears on the things you *want.*\n\nThis is what it means to have a \u201cS.M.A.R.T.\u201d goal \u2013 small, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. When you conform your efforts to translate into something small yet meaningful to your life, it changes the perspective.\n\nBut even if you decide to take your bi-weekly retirement contribution and YOLO it on MU FDs, you\u2019ve got just as much of a chance of coming ahead with that as you do giving it to Mr. Market to hold for the next 20 years.\n\nBoomers will tell you \u201cmost day traders lose money!\u201d First, \u201cday trader\u201d is a specific term. But that aside, it is also true most businesses fail in the first year. In both cases, people get burned, give up and go back to what they know. They fail to plan, they fail to learn from experience, and they fail to persevere. \n\nThis is not an appeal to \u201cnot be average\u201d nor to keep \u201cchasing bad money with good\u201d - just to keep trying. Set your goals, manage your risk, hone your successes, and learn from your failures.\n\nAt no other time in history has it been possible for the average Joe to participate in the equities market with so little friction as commission-free mobile trading, and with so much leverage as weekly options. I know, because I\u2019m old enough to remember when stock quotes were in the weekly paper, and they were registered in one-eighths of a dollar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL,DR; T**o Hell with the haters like Cramer and his ilk. Keep learning and growing and trying to rake in tendies. The lambo isn\u2019t the goal - *financial freedom* is. An Ally savings account and a shit job the boss is trying his damnedest to offshore ain\u2019t gonna get you there. We live in a Merchant Republic awash in wealth, and you have the right \u2013 the obligation, even - to participate. Go get your fucking slice.\n\nI love you retards.",

        "selftext": "I am quite surprised to see there hasn't been anything written about R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Company (NYSE: RRD).\n\nDespite being a very large company with massive revenue, they are extremely nimble and have handled the pandemic beyond my wildest expectations. They trade like a penny stock, with an extremely low market cap despite having billions in sales. \n\nBut what makes RRD even more special, is that it has a good bit of drama behind the recent share price cycling. This is not insider info or anything like that, and no I do not work for RRD.\n\nYou can look all this up of course, as it is all public info. Mid/late last year, there was an investment firm who apparently does hostile takeovers, Chatham Asset Management. For an example of what they do, look up McClatchy or read this NYT article:\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/media/hedge-fund-chatham-mcclatchy-postmedia-newspapers.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/media/hedge-fund-chatham-mcclatchy-postmedia-newspapers.html) \n\nThey bought up 12.9% of RRD and it raised their board's eyebrows, and they passed a shareholder protection plan, which basically stated nobody can own more than 10% of RRD, else you have to liquidate your position down below 10%. That seemingly upset Chatham, because they called it a \"poison pill\" but in reality RRD was protecting itself. You can read RRD\u2019s response to Chatham here:\n\n[https://investor.rrd.com/news-releases/rrd-sends-letter-response-chatham-asset-management](https://investor.rrd.com/news-releases/rrd-sends-letter-response-chatham-asset-management) \n\nSince then, Chatham seems to have bad blood and was holding the stock down, as they tried to liquidate their position. They bought in at an average roughly $2 per share, and they owned 9,141,657 at climax. They sold off approximately 4 million shares as of June 1st's filing, and now own a maximum of 7.5%. It is widely speculated that the reason it kept capping out at $2 is because Chatham was trying to sell out and break even. By all accounts, this is a $3-4 stock all day long. \n\nNumerous other firms/banks are buying up shares. Geode (fidelity) has [$1M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/1M) stake, Acadian 1.95M, State Street 2.26M, Saba 4.5M, Whitebox 2.3M, Brigade 1.74M, etc. and they've been increasing their positions for a steep discount since Chatham apparently kept selling it back to the ground. However, it is also widely speculated that Chatham\u2019s position has now been mostly, if not entirely liquidated. A run back up to $2 may be the last time RRD is in the $1 range, as there would be no further selloff. \n\nFinancially, RRD looks very sound. With their most recent ER on July 28th, they beat EPS by $0.07 and beat revenue by $14.90 million. Historically RRD has also paid a dividend, and if/when the covid19 situation turns around, it is expected the dividend would be restored as well. \n\nThey were the company responsible for printing the 2020 Census materials:\n\n[https://www.piworld.com/article/rr-donnelley-awarded-114m-contract-for-2020-census-production/](https://www.piworld.com/article/rr-donnelley-awarded-114m-contract-for-2020-census-production/)\n\nIt is entirely possible RRD will be printing mail-in ballots for the 2020 Presidential Election as well. In their Q1 2020 results filing, they stated:\n\n\u201c\\[RRD\\] is also receiving pandemic-related orders in many parts of its business, including special notification letters, government mailings, product packaging, labels, signage, mail-in ballots, test kit assembly, emergency kits, digital creative and COVID-19 specific consumer research and analytics.\u201d\n\nSource: [https://investor.rrd.com/news/news-details/2020/RRD-Reports-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx](https://investor.rrd.com/news/news-details/2020/RRD-Reports-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx)\n\nAdditionally, read what one of the Analysts asked on the July 29th ER call, and see how RRD's CEO responded:\n\n**Charlie Strauzer** \\-- *CJS Securities -- Analyst*\n\n\"\\[...\\] there's a lot of talk about this election year about mail-in ballots and other things where you potentially -- that could benefit you in terms of extra print work related to that? Are you starting to see some of that, you know, at the early stages here yet? Or do you think that will pick up more on Q4?\"\n\n**Dan Knotts** \\-- *President and Chief Executive Officer*\n\n\"Yeah. Charlie, it's Dan. The -- the election revenue -- that, you know, election season and the revenue that comes along with that. And we do expect to be a participant in that again this year and utilizing our commercial -- primarily our commercial print platform to support -- uh, to support those efforts.\n\nWe're seeing some of it flow through now. We expect to see more flow through in Q3. Relative to the mail-in ballot piece, we've connected with every state. And you know, given our work, leveraging our work on the Census and our performance on the Census, we're staying very close to that each of those individual states as they -- as they make those decisions.\"\n\nSource:  [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/rr-donnelley-sons-rrd-q2-2020-earnings-call-transc.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/rr-donnelley-sons-rrd-q2-2020-earnings-call-transc.aspx) \n\n\\--\n\nFinally, in regards to competitor\u2019s stocks, RRD is extremely undervalued in every way. Their most direct competitor is Quad which has fewer sales yet trades at a higher p/s and p/c. See this chart of companies in the same/similar niche. \n\n[Why RRD? Growth, Undervalued, Gov't Deals &amp; Institutional Ownership.](https://preview.redd.it/ssrjeylqgaf51.png?width=492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ae178e6ec05d5a16ef516ab1216ad6272a2f54c)\n\nI believe, for all of these reasons, that RRD has been overlooked and brushed aside by most retail investors. It doesn't pop up on RobinHood's radar, it doesn't have a massive following online, yet they frequently release Press Releases with positive news and beat expectations. \n\nI am currently long on RRD, but wanted to share my research and findings with others since nobody seems to be talking about RRD.",

I've been swing trading TSLA, PRPL cult, and some other volatile stocks 8 hours a day. \n\nI see Musk's buttock of a stock drop to $1380, and although my heart said to buy calls, I knew I wouldn't check my portfolio as I liquidated all positions the day before, and instead bought 30 shares instead of a couple $1450 9/18 calls.\n\nI get back home, happy to see that it jumped to just under $1,500. But then the stock split gets announced, and sure, I made a few grand, but had ai grabbed the calls... I'd have made well over 200 grand.\n\nThis month is my first month of FOMO. And I want to buy calls on $ROPE.",

I believe it was a free ride or GVF but not sure.\n\nSo looking at this now, I day traded a stock I bought yesterday with all my settled funds. I then bought new stocks today with the proceeds I got from the sell(I believe the cash from the day trade never settled). I know I can't sell because I did not used \"settled funds\" but rather \"cash available to trade\".

        "selftext": "I wrote an `R` function to analyze a table of lots that make up a stock position for a single company (specifically, a single ticker). In addition to the normal stuff, it also provides adjustments for dividend reinvestments (and the relevant taxes on those dividends), as well as tax implications for selling. Short and long holding periods are considered automatically.\n\nThe function takes the following  arguments\n\n**data** \\- a data.frame with named columns *PurchaseDate*, *Quantity*, *CostPerShare*, *DivReInvest*, and *CapGainsRate*. Entries in the *DivReInvest* column take a value of 1 if the purchase was a dividend reinvestment, and 0 if it was not a dividend reinvestment. The CapGainsRate value will typically be the capital gains tax rate applicable *for the year of purchase*. In the event that a lot was purchased so recently income tax rates apply, use your marginal income tax rate for the specified value.\n\n**cgr** \\- Your capital gains tax rate for date specified with *date* argument.\n\n**itr** \\- Your current marginal income tax rate\n\n**price** \\- the market share price for the date specified with  *date* argument. Defaults to current date.\n\nThe output of the function is a list with two elements. The first element is an enhanced version of the data.frame passed as *data*. As before, each row represents one lot. The second element is a summary of the entire position with some useful information that can be tedious to calculate manually.\n\nFirst, I've built the table with the basic lot data below for a hypothetical investment in AAPL. In practice, all of the columns but Ticker, DivReInvest, and CapGainsRate are copied from from the individual lots view of my Fidelity account (as accessed via Safari on MacOS), into a Numbers spreadsheet. I change the column headers, delete unwanted columns, and add a column each for *CapGainsRate* and *DivReInvest*. From there, I save it, and import it into `R`.\n\n    # Build a hypothetical stock position.\n    \n    aapl = data.frame(Ticker = rep(\"AAPL\", 8),\n                      PurchaseDate = c(\"2019-01-03\", \"2019-02-08\", \"2019-05-10\",\n                                       \"2019-08-09\", \"2019-11-07\", \"2020-02-07\",\n                                       \"2020-05-08\", \"2020-08-07\"),\n                      Quantity = c(100, 0.436, 0.392, 0.386, 0.300, 0.244, 0.269, 0.188),\n                      CostPerShare = c(142.19, 167.45, 197.18, 200.99,\n                                       259.43, 320.03, 310.13, 444.45),\n                      DivReInvest = c(0, rep(1, 7)),\n                      CapGainsRate = rep(0.15, 8))\n\nHere is the function:\n\n    analyzePosition = function(data, cgr = 0.15, itr = 0.3, price, date = Sys.Date()) {\n    \tdata$PurchaseDate = as.Date(data$PurchaseDate)\n    \tdata$LongHoldDate = data$PurchaseDate + 365\n    \tdata$CostBasis = round(data$Quantity * data$CostPerShare, digits = 2)\n    \tdata$AdjCostBasis = round(ifelse(data$DivReInvest == 1,\n                                             data$CapGainsRate * data$CostBasis,\n                                             data$CostBasis),\n                                      digits = 2)\n    \tdata$PresentValue = round(data$Quantity * price, digits = 2)\n    \tdata$UnrealizedGain =\n                round(data$PresentValue - data$CostBasis, digits = 2)\n    \tdata$AdjUnrealizedGain =\n                round(data$PresentValue - data$AdjCostBasis, digits = 2)\n    \tdata$LiquidationTax = round(ifelse(data$LongHoldDate &gt; date,\n                                               data$UnrealizedGain * itr,\n                                               data$UnrealizedGain * cgr),\n                                        digits = 2)\n    \tdata$LiquidValue = data$PresentValue - data$LiquidationTax\n    \tdata$LiquidValuePerShare = round(data$LiquidValue / data$Quantity,\n                                             digits = 2)\n    \tdata$GainPercentage = round(100 * data$UnrealizedGain / data$CostBasis,\n                                        digits = 2)\n    \tdata$AdjGainPercentage =\n                round(100 * (data$PresentValue / data$AdjCostBasis - 1), digits = 2)\n    \n    \tcostBasis = sum(data$CostBasis)\n    \tadjCostBasis = sum(data$AdjCostBasis)\n    \tpresentValue = sum(data$PresentValue)\n    \tunrealizedGain = sum(data$UnrealizedGain)\n    \tnetDivReInvest = costBasis - adjCostBasis\n    \tunrealizedTaxLiability = sum(data$LiquidationTax)\n    \tliquidNetValue = presentValue - unrealizedTaxLiability\n    \tliquidationNetProfit = liquidNetValue - costBasis\n    \tadjLiquidationNetProfit = liquidNetValue - adjCostBasis\n    \tunrealizedGainPercent =\n                ifelse(costBasis != 0, 100 * unrealizedGain / costBasis, NA)\n    \tadjUnrealizedGainPercent =\n    \t    ifelse(adjCostBasis != 0, 100 * (presentValue / adjCostBasis - 1), NA)\n    \tunrealizedNetGainPercent =\n    \t    ifelse(costBasis != 0, 100 * liquidationNetProfit / costBasis, NA)\n    \tadjUnrealizedNetGainPercent =\n    \t    ifelse(adjCostBasis != 0,\n                       100 * adjLiquidationNetProfit / adjCostBasis,\n                       NA)\n    \treEntryPrice = ifelse(unrealizedGain &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; sum(data$Quantity) != 0,\n                                  price - sum(data$LiquidationTax) / sum(data$Quantity),\n                                  NA)\n    \t\n    \tout = data.frame(SummaryStatistic = c(\"Cost Basis\",\n                                                  \"Reinvested After-tax Dividends\",\n                                                  \"Adjusted Cost Basis\",\n                                                  \"Present Market Value\",\n                                                  \"Current Market Share Price\",\n                                                  \"Unrealized Gain (Pre-tax)\",\n                                                  \"Unrealized Pre-tax Gain (%)\",\n                                                  \"Adjusted Unrealized Pre-tax Gain (%)\",\n                                                  \"\",\n                                                  \"Unrealized Tax Liability\",\n                                                  \"Position Value (After-tax)\",\n                                                  \"Unrealized Gain (After-tax)\",\n                                                  \"Adjusted Unrealized Gain (After-tax)\",\n                                                  \"Unrealized After-tax Gain (%)\",\n                                                  \"Adj.

        "selftext": "I ended up with a wash sale that I wasn\u2019t planning on. I bought some shares of CMG. Then on 2 different days within the week I bought some more as it dropped down some to bring down my cost basis per share. About a week later I sold all shares for a small profit over my new cost basis. The price I sold at was above most of my shares, but was below some of the first ones I bought. The loss on those first shares show up on Fidelity as a wash sale so I can\u2019t count those losses against my gains for tax purposes. I thought that to create a wash sale I would have had to buy CMG again within 30 days after I sold. But I never bought CMG again after I sold all my shares so why did I end up with a wash sale on those first shares?",

        "selftext": "**A little background:**\n\n22yr old beginning to invest in stocks, ETFS, Retirement, etc. Long Term investment strategy\n\nI currently have a taxable brokerage account, Roth IRA, 401k(split between Roth and traditional) and finally an HSA all with Fidelity. I actively contribute to all of them. I max out my Roth IRA and contribute to my employer match for my 401k at the bare minimum. Rest of the money goes into the taxable account. \n\nMy current brokerage account is all stocks. The usuals(AAPL, DIS, BABA, etc). My Roth IRA will mainly be mutual funds(FZROX, etc) and MSFT. I mistakenly added MSFT to my Roth IRA and since it\u2019s a long term hold anyway, I don\u2019t feel like selling and rebuying in my taxable account. I want to open a second brokerage account specifically for ETFs. Haven\u2019t decided the ETFs yet but looking at VOO or an equivalent, WCLD, maybe ARKK.\n\nMy question is, is this a good or bad idea? Is it too many accounts? Any other ETFs suggestions? Any other suggestions in general?\n\nThanks in advance",

        "selftext": "Some of you may know what this company is. Some of you may even use it's service, idk. For those who don't know, Sezzle is an ASX-listed US payment services company, that allows you to make a purchase online, and have it split into 4 interest free payments (1 at time of purchase and 3 more spaced 2 weeks apart each) to a debit or credit card. \nNow, I like their service. So much so, that I bought a small (10 share) position through my Fidelity international account, roughly a month ago. In that time, it has gone up about 75%.\nNow, if you do some google searching, you'll find plenty of \"experts\" that say it's a shit company, don't touch it. I say this is a winner, an underdog.\nWhy, do you ask? Simple. I use their services on a semi-regular basis, and I just used it for a purchase today. When I got the confirmation email, there was a link to a survey. Well, I took the survey. It was all about banking, specifically checking accounts. 10-15 questions or so, about features you look for in a checking account, how important those features are to you, etc. All the questions led to a culminating question;  Would you be interested in opening a checking account through Sezzle with features such as: no overdraft fees, no monthly account minimum fees, no late fees on Sezzle purchases, ability to easily send money to friends and family, debit card with no ATM fees, and 2-day early direct deposit?\nI have no option but to conclude that they're looking to become a rival of Chime and other recently popular online banking companies. Obviously this is conjecture, and you won't find this in their prospectus or any news articles, but I think it could be big.\n\nTLDR: ASX-listed Sezzle (SZL:AU) might be a real winner.\nAlso, for the retards out there, international trading means you pay a commission ^gasp.",

I have $2,000 in my Fidelity account with $400 waiting to be invested and $1,000 in my robinhood with $700 to be invested. My question is, should i dump a bigger percentage of my money into stocks or am i good where i am? I work a minimum wage job although right now i\u2019m on unemployment. I live at home with little expenses and feel like $10,000 would be be a good idea to just keep on hand. I\u2019m not into options trading or very risky moves, I currently have shares of apple, microsoft, Activision, Take Two, Cisco and Pepsi however i was thinking of getting rid of that. I know i need to diversify more and was planning on buying into some index funds over the next few weeks and months and adding more to my current positions. Would it be smart to add, let\u2019s say $2000 more dollars, over that time or would you guys add more since savings accounts are basically useless and the dollar is getting weaker.",

A season has been in the works for a few years now.  Frank has confirmed a 2021 season starting in April and ending July 1. \n\nThere will be a spring football league. Absolutely. The people want it and it will happen. \n\nAs recently as last month MLFB jumped from .002 to .02 a 10x with no news.  Leading up to the season before COVID the price was nearly .06 - 20x on current prices. If this league has a successful launch who knows where the price will end up.\n\nIt is OTC so it\u2019s not on Robinhood or Webull. \n\nE*TRADE you have to call in your order, 1-800-387-2331. \n\nYou can trade freely on Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and Fidelity.",

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nMy wife recently came into some money from her mom and it is all in a Fidelity account. While getting things changed over into her name, the people helping us suggested using their adviser services. We have done a couple of free meetings discussing goals and what we have and all the major assets. \n\nFrom this, he gave us a general plan and a cost estimate of .94% (+ fund expense ratios) to manage this for us. This would include re-balancing as needed, adjusting the asset ratios as plans change, and in general making adjustments to meet the general ups and downs of the market. The general plan looks like a bunch of mutual funds and a few things called SMA's (Separately Managed Account).\n\nMy question is: does that cost sound reasonable? does anyone have experience with Fidelity Management?\n\nI have been managing my 401k for years with no issues and i think I'm doing pretty good on that front. My wife is leaning toward giving them a chance and I'm unsure of the cost.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I am currently 21 and in college as the title says, and over the past two years I have maxed out my Roth IRA contributions in my account at Fidelity, which are being invested into FDKVX (Fidelity Freedom 2060 Fund) which is a target-date fund. I have just recently gotten into looking at this fund and others that I could possibly buy. Now I'm very new to this, but from what I can tell it seems that FDKVX follows the exact same trend as fidelity's total market/SP500 fund (FXAIX) except it consistently gets less of a percent return. So what I am wondering is, if either way, I am going to let my money sit for a very long time, why would I want to be invested in the target-date fund and not FXAIX which seems to perform better. I have also heard that FZROX is basically the same as FXAIX but with a 0% expense ratio, so why would anyone invest in FXAIX if that is the case. Any input would be appreciated, thanks!",

I make about 1400 a month, spending 850 for all living expenses (rent, groceries, utilities) leaving me with around 550 a month for everything else. I do end up spending most of this 550 (drinks with friends, maintaining my bike, shopping etc), or use what I save monthly (~100) for a yearly holiday and going home to see my family for Christmas. I have a few thousand saved from when I was working previously, and I have been trying to use this for investing. When I finish my PhD, I should hopefully see an increase in salary and will be able to invest more. \n\nI currently have 1000 invested via an ISA with 500 in HSBC FTSE 250 and 500 in Legal&amp;General UK index (both accumulation).\n\nI have an additional ~3000 GBP that I would like to invest but I\u2019m just kind of at a loss of what to do.\n\nI don\u2019t mind taking some risk (I guess medium risk? Maybe some high risk?) and I am interested in global markets and emerging markets. Also sustainable funds would be great. I am not investing for any particular reason mostly I\u2019m just looking to grow my money (and I\u2019m happy not to touch these investments at all, eg a 20-30 year time frame). \n\nI\u2019ve been looking at fidelity and vanguard tracker funds, as well as the S&amp;P 500. from what I understand it\u2019s best to have one fund aimed at developed global markets and one at emerging global markets, only I\u2019m not sure which ones are right for me.\n\nDoes anybody have suggestions for the best way to invest my 3000 GBP?\n\nThank you for reading all this!",

        "selftext": "So i just turned 16 years old, and my uncle, who is doing very well for himself off of investing, opened me a brokerage account with Fidelity and gave me $500 to learn the trade and have a retirement fund for myself. Hes teaching me what he knows, giving me tips and showing me the ropes, but wants me to make the decisions with the money. He says that if i turn the $500 into $5k then that's great, but if i turn it into 5 cents then at least i learned something. I'm very great full for this opportunity he has given me to start early and set myself up for success, just looking for any beginner tips from you experienced folks.  \n\nI'm into tech and build custom pcs for people i know, so i already have a good understanding of manufacturing companies such as Intel, AMD, Nvidia, TSMC, and the ARM talks. When i told him about these he bought some shares of AMD and Intel, so i guess that was a good call? He also told me to invest in a food stock, so i'm thinking of General Mills (GIS)? Like i said i'm very new to this, but i'm a fast learner and hope to make something out of his generosity. Thanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been riding AMD\u2019s cock since late June and have made some great returns, especially in the past two weeks. That being said, today I sold my remaining call contracts on the stock. No, not because I think AMD is going to drop (although it will have price pullback all the way down to $77)- but because I think there\u2019s an opportunity that many investors (including you autists and bag holders) are overlooking.\n\nINTC took a massive hit the last two weeks (-$13.42 between 07/20-07/31) , following a pump on AMD after their Q2 earnings beat, with the additional help of many news outlets covering the AMD versus INTC battle. In the midst of all of this, INTC decides to let everyone know that they will not be manufacturing chips anymore- which sealed the deal on AMD being a dominant force in the chip manufacturing industry. \n\nI see a lot of people, especially on this retarded reddit page full of blind option traders (with the exception of the 10% who know what they are doing) talk about how \u201cINTC is going to drop all the way down to $32\u201d... \n\n\n\n- Here is what you need to understand about Intel -\n\nSince 2014, Intel\u2019s revenue in the Client Computing Group (chip manufacturing) has dropped almost 7% in 6 years. You cannot let this news regarding Intel\u2019s switch in corporate direction give jurisdiction on whether you think the corporation will be of any value a year from now. It is obvious that Intel has been slowing the production of their chips for atleast two years now, and they have slowly been shifting in a different direction because of an increase in revenue provided from the data sector.\n\n\n\nSo what does this all mean?\n\nThe fact that Intel has cut the manufacturing of chips is actually a good thing for the corporation, whether you think so or not. It has been a slowly-decaying revenue stream for years, and the money can be implemented in other sectors in which Intel has seen yearly-growth in revenue.\n\nI know, it\u2019s hard. Intel isn\u2019t making chips, doesn\u2019t make sense right? Yea it kind of doesn\u2019t make sense. BUT, in a broader scheme of things, it does. They have been getting killed by their competitors for years, so the move seems appropriate.\n\n\n\nINTC STOCK\n\nThe only times INTC stock has dropped below $50, in the past 3 years, were for the following reasons:\n\nAugust to February 2018- Intel suffers scrutiny for announcing that they are shifting their focus away from chip making and towards A.I., memory solutions, cloud computing, and IoT.\n\nJuly to August 2019- News articles released regarding AMD\u2019s new Ryzen chips and their comparison to Intel.\n\nMarch 2020- Do i really need to explain this drop\n\n\n\nConsensus\n\nINTC has been hinting for YEARS that they are leaving the chip manufacturing sector and turning towards other profitable ones. Their latests announcement shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but if you are someone who hasn\u2019t followed them for years- then it may seem like one.\n\n\n\nThe reason you are reading this\n\nINTC 60C - exp 01/15/21 \nThese \u201crelatively small\u201d leap contracts are sold for pennies on the fucking dollar right now. If you read what I just wrote, which I\u2019m sure most of you won\u2019t- then you would understand that this move has a lot potential. Right now, INTC isn\u2019t gonna drop any more. If it goes below $40, then maybe I\u2019m wrong.\n\nBut I\u2019m never wrong.\n\n\n\nAmd to the moon, but lets not be retarded on how we value a major corporation like this. I mean cmon. LOL",

        "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone &amp; iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.",

        "selftext": "Listen up fuckers.\n\n\nI\u2019m not ludicrously experienced with options, but I can recognize some bullshit when I see it. This arcticle [(Intel \u2018Stunning Failure\u2019 Heralds End of an Era for U.S. Chip Sector)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html) and a bunch of other \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b news caused $INTC to drop off the face of the earth last week. \n\n\nI kinda fail to see the drama. Intel has always outsourced it's chips. Maybe it's doing it more now, but even 8 years ago when my brother and I built our first PC's. His chip was from Mexico, mine was from Taiwan. \n\n\nFurthermore, TSMC, the company this article says Intel should sell factories to, has been the heavyweight chip maker for a decade or more.\n\n\nNvidia and AMD for example, they are the two graphics card manufacturers. BOTH of them have their chips made by TSMC. These companies do all their designing, but in the end everything is made by TSMC anyway. At least, a lions share of it.\n\n\nNow, Intel definitely has struggled in the recent market, but that's because they've demolished AMD in the performance chip market for nearly two decades. There was no reason to keep pushing their envelope, spending billions on R&amp;D for a better product. All they had to do was refine their Lake series processors and they'd continue to rake in a ton of profit. This profit was used to expand their market to the mobile industry. Particularly laptops. For a long time it was hard to get an apple product with any kind of processor that wasn't Intel.\n\n\nThey're not going away. They're not crashing.\n\n\nThey're just finally seeing AMD pass them in one market. This has caused other markets to start to shift due to uncertainty about who the \"best\" chip manufacturer is, but trust me - we will see Intel back with a fiery vengeance.\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Intel pops out some high core count chips that are pushing 5.0-5.5 all core clock count speeds. Once they scale down their transistor size... Oof. It's going to be a Rottweiler back in the pit. \n\n\n\nTL;DR INTC $55c 09/18, but load up on whatever the hell you want, these contracts are CHEAP",

        "selftext": "Not sure why more people aren\u2019t talking about Intel (INTC), especially given the recent run-up we\u2019ve seen from rival AMD. INTC is only up 8% from yearly lows, and severely underpriced in my opinion, and see serious runway in the next few months back up to February highs of $65-$68 \u2013 options are cheap as well with IV only at 40% in most cases. \n\n**Earnings and Revenue Beat** \n\nQ2 earnings were up 16% and revenue was up by over 20%, despite COVID. The stock dropped admittedly as people looked to delayed 7 nano-meter processors until 2022, which isn\u2019t great (AMD\u2019s is in market), but people have overlooked their core revenue drivers that supported earnings beat in the pandemic. See the chart below from last week \u2013 the 13% drop in the stock only puts it closer to support at around the $55 level.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Things to Consider:** \n\n\u2022\tIntel is the worlds largest chip maker, and boasts high return on assets by free cash flow \n\n\u2022\tIntel is still a high growth company \u2013 namely in revenue and free cashflow. Worth also looking at gross profit growth, operating income growth and EPS growth \n\n\u2022\tStrong balance sheet strength and trend \n\n\u2022\tHigh yield backed by strong dividend coverage by free cash flow and strong financial statement trends \n\n\u2022\tWorth looking at how many hedge funds (smart money) picked up Intel in Q1/Q2 ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-intel-163602103.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-intel-163602103.html))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cheap Options / Low IV** \n\nIV is minimal on most Sept-Oct calls, and volume is great given that it\u2019s the worlds largest chipmaker.

For example, in 2017, they dropped 32 bit app support for iOS 11. In 2018, their macOS Mojave forced developers to use their Metal framework (That's why Nvidia cards don't work anymore in eGPUs) In 2019, macOS Catalina dropped support for 32 bit apps.\n\nThese 3 steps are incredibly important to the Apple Silicon Macs coming this Fall because one of the most important features is the ability to run completely unmodified iPhone and iPad apps on day 1, which of course, are 64 bit apps that run using the Metal framework on the current Apple Silicon chips. manufactured by TSMC. \n\nBecause of this, the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon chips is gonna be much more smooth compared to the previous transition from PowerPC to Intel chips. \n\nA major benefit for the future is that app developers can build apps that have most of the code shared across all Apple devices, which minor adjustments to get the UI to scale properly from the Mac, to the iPad, to the iPhone and of course the Apple TV.\n\nAnd a huge benefit will be the ability to fix bugs and optimize code for all platforms at once instead of having to do it all separately since the main code is shared.\n\nAnd unlike the last transition, Rosetta 2 can now translate x86 app code into ARM-supported code during the install time instead of using real-time emulation. And for plugins and drivers, Rosetta 2 emulates them as well.\n\nDevelopers who have been using Apple's Developer Transition Kit with the A12Z chip from the iPad Pro have already mentioned that Rosetta 2 works incredibly well, much better than expected:  \n[https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20](https://twitter.com/yiningkarlli/status/1278897047324602369?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/never\\_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1288658469827104769?s=20)\n\nAnd this is with the A12Z chip, which mind you, hasn't changed in terms of processing performance from the A12X chip from 2018. This is also a chip that comes in an iPad Pro that is thinner than any iPhone ever, and has absolutely zero active cooling. \n\nThat chip from 2018 currently outperforms Intel's brand new 10th-gen 10nm chip that came in the 2020 MacBook Pro in terms of both processing and Metal graphics performance.\n\nApple Silicon Macs will of course, have active fan cooling, and Apple has already stated that their Apple Silicon chips for their Macs will be a brand new family of chips, and each Mac will have a chip built specifically for it's enclosure and it's cooling capabilities.\n\nAnd Apple has mentioned that their Silicon has been built for years with easy scalability in mind, so they can add much more cores into the new Mac chips, especially since they'll have active fan cooling. \n\nBecause of the pandemic, Apple's original plans to release a new iPad Pro this Fall with the brand new A14X chip built on TSMC's new 5nm process and a new Mini-LED display were delayed, so that's why the released the 2020 iPad Pro in March, where they basically reused the A12X chip and rebranded it.\n\nSo right now, most investors have no idea how good the A14X is gonna be.\n\nThe A13 chip from last year's iPhones already performs incredibly well in terms of single-core performance, almost neck and neck with Intel's i9-9900K.\n\nThe new A14 chip will be a major improvement, due to being the first chip built on TSMC's 5nm chip.\n\nThere will also be an A14X chip will have a massive improvement over the current A12Z chip, and let me remind you that it will be in an iPad Pro that's thin and passively cooled.\n\nThis same 5nm technology is gonna be scaled up to fit active cooled Apple Silicon Mac computers, first coming into MacBooks like the MacBook Air and the 13\" MacBook Pro, and then into the redesigned 24\" iMac. \n\nOne of the first rumored chips will be a 12-core 5nm chip built by TSMC with 8 high performance cores and 4 efficiency cores. This will likely go into the MacBook Pro. \n\nI'm almost certain that it will outperform the previous Intel-based MacBook Pros in every way. And on top of that, the new Apple Silicon chips will come with Apple's Neural engine and machine learnings accelerations. Along with that, they'll get the same HEVC hardware accelerators as well, which is now becoming the standard for video recording. \n\nBasically, the point of all of this is that TSMC's new 5nm chips that will come in the Apple Silicon Macs are gonna be much faster than anyone is expecting, and those first Macs are rumored to be coming this October or November. \n\nThese chips will shake the entire industry due to the vast performance per watt improvements and the way Apple is gonna use them in terms of their Apple devices sharing the same code. \n\nAnd if Apple succeeds in this transition, there's a very good chance that the rest of the industry will start slowly switching to ARM-based chips, which TSMC is the leader in. (Intel is way behind in ARM chip technology)\n\nBecause of this, TSMC will be confirmed as the leader in chip-making technology, and investors will jump onboard.\n\nTheir main advantage is that they're the first to 5nm, and Samsung is currently having trouble with their 5nm process. Their Note 20 Ultra isn't launching with 5nm chips like people expected.  \n\"A new [report](https://www.zhitongcaijing.com/content/detail/324146.html) out of China (via [*GizmoChina*](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/08/05/samsung-lost-qualcomm-5nm-orders-tsmc/)), however, suggests Samsung may have lost most, if not all, of that business to Taiwanese rival TSMC\"\n\n[https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875](https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-reportedly-choose-tsmc-over-samsung-its-upcoming-snapdragon-875)\n\nSo Samsung is having trouble. Intel is having trouble, ordering wafers from TSMC. AMD is ordering wafers from TSMC. Qualcomm is ordering wafers from TSMC.\n\nTSMC is now becoming the Sony of the chip-making world. (Sony owns the camera sensor market by such a vast margin that a TON of cameras come with Sony sensors)\n\nWhat if TSMC becomes the next Sony and more companies rely on them for chips instead of investing into their own chip technology? \n\nSummary: Buy Long calls. Especially while the whole market is having a down day today. Buy the dip!\n\nPositions: TSM $100c 1/15/21",

        "selftext": "Microchip is a semiconductor company out of Arizona with a Mkt. Cap of about $26 Billion. They make chips for a bunch of products like Cyber Security, Wireless Products, and Telecommunications. The thing is that they earnings on 08/04 Tuesday after hours. It is very obvious that are going to beat earnings. Why? Because look at the rest of the industry: Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Qorvo, and IBM have all destroyed earnings. And since Intel just told everyone that they're too retarded to even make potato chips all the smaller time semiconductor competitors are making bank, example: AMD and QCOM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrochip isn't just your run of the mill small back water company. They actually make acquisitions of other chip companies and use their intellectual property to increase the quality and market share of their own chips. Microchip was found in 1989 and has since made 16 acquistions!!! \n\nYou may, for some reason, say that only big boy chip companies are gonna beat earnings. Well if you don't believe me think about the industries that depend on Microchip for their needs: online educational servicing companies, cloud servicing companies, cyber security companies, telecommunications companies, and just software/tech companies in general. What the hell do we already know about these industries from earnings season? We know they absolutely massacred earnings estimates as everything during COVID has gone tech. Yes, the age of actual industry is dead. Now there are only tech companies that get pumped because of sky high demand (looking at you Apple) and Amazon that sells random shit and still has a tech company valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and you know what's awesome because we have all this knowledge? MCHP is expected to post $1.43 EPS on tuesday, but last year on this quarter they posted $1.41 EPS. What a fucking joke, we should expect at least 40-50% growth in that number from COVID induced semiconductor demand. Not to mention, I think MCHP is gaining market share and could be a big player in a few years in the semiconductor industry. \n\nYou might be hesitant because of my last post on $TER, a chip supplier that many people played incorrectly. I say to you, fuck you. I made money on that play because I sold directly at market open after they destroyed earnings like my data said they would. So if you feel even the slightest FOMO look at these charts from last week: QCOM, QRVO, and AMD; and then tell me what you think MCHP (the same industry) will do!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; MCHP $107c 08/07",

Or GOOG invents an improvement to instant results, ie Mind Results, results pop up on your android even before you type anything, and it works on 50 different languages.

Recent excessive beatdown due to AMD getting the spotlight and chip delays. Consolidating around \\~$48 primed for a gap up. Intel is still insanely profitable with lots of collaborations and products lined up. Also safe from any COVID-19 related shutdowns.\n2. Consistent Grind Up history after beatdowns. Tends to slowly increase, but expecting a Pop tomorrow or Wednesday due to some factors listed below.\n3. Ex-dividend date this Thursday. Dividends are only distributed if bought before the date so run ups are higher likely tomorrow and Wednesday. Dividend also demonstrates the fundamental strength of the company.\n4. Alot of Insider buying recently with leaked Institutional buying this week(sorry can\u2019t say who but yeah going to get called out but it is what it isss).\n5. Stimulus package confirmation this week may cause excessive euphoria in market-leading to even more buying.\n\nSafe price target would be \\~50.4 and could easily run past 52+. Hope this helps!",

        "selftext": "TSM has been on my radar since I started saving to invest in 2018 because of AMD / GlobalFoundries. Really interesting business model for Semis AMD has.\n\nIn 2019, you couldn't get away from heating up of the trade war. Congress began debating SAR for HK around the end of  Hong Kong's \"2019 Summer of Love\" and rumors of what happens in the \"re-education\" camps / \"Where did the Falun Gong practitioners go?\" This is important because of the SWIFT system of world banking. HK is how they get dollars.\n\nThen in November of 2019, this happened..\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Human_Rights_and_Democracy_Act#Related_bill\n\nArizona plant news is where the tin foil ends and the conviction began for me. The Foundry is basically THE corporation of Taiwan. The Great Cheetoh has been making deals around the world, and technically Taiwan isn't China. We have recent armament deals with Taiwan and Japan to prove it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TLKt9yPb-f0\n\nWhy not?? Seemed like the American thing to do and there is a republican in office hell-bent on decoupling US communications tech from the CCP aka ROC.\n\nIn Feb / March... Rona. April the economic fallout, news about bad PPE and tests from China being sold to Italy. In May all the US boats in Taiwanese waters and the rhetoric worldwide basically reflecting that the world isn't happy with the CCP.\n\nI had the balance for a RH call and it made more sense than an airline play at the time, so i got in.\n\nAnti CCP rhetoric started heating up and bi-partisan on the YouTube's, by the way, it seems 2020 is the year NBC (Comcast) discovered ad-revenue. Thank you Lester.\n\nAt this point morning wood for TSM was a regular thing, so i set my limits on call options for both accounts, and incorporated into the LT DRIP. Thank you Papa Powell. I'm still poor, couldn't have done it without you...\n\nThen it seemed to be heating up at the end of May. Everyone is like WTF 'mate on the \"One Belt. One Road.\" Initiative, both the geographical and digital. People are really starting to report on not-so-great stories out of China, and not just tinfoil or Epoch Times channels.\n\nLot of shade being thrown on China tech, and things are heating up in S China Sea.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6KiLhxgIBys\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BTgDYhtr-LU\n\n...looks like Chy-na is on everyone's shit list, including Australia. Forex folks know how dope-tied the Aussie's and Kiwis are to CCP trade relations.\n\n The rumor was potential decouple from China. I mean the world is kinda dope-tied to Santa's little elves. I just realized how weird Christmas will be...\n\nI bought my shares for both accounts as per the voodoo ritual of purchasing at least 1 stock of a long term call strategy. Got my hand deep (for me) in the cookie jar May and June.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/xb7ptte\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/ToFdT3z\n\nThird week of July called a bull flag on hourly:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hwz949/daily_discussion_thread_for_july_24_2020/fz4bi1b?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nJuly 24th, I got filled to the teeth in RH and my now free play in Webull was up 1,600%.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/0fB3FEp\n\nTHEN July 27th, I closed my \"free play\" in Webull at $1,250. A little over 3,000% between 2 contracts that cost $75 total.\n\nAlong the way, i picked up RH tendies and rebalanced the cash / bought more contracts and shares.

        "selftext": "Alright retards, strap in. I read the FAA's 96 page summary on the 737 MAX and have the following to report. Here is the link in case you want to read for [yourself](https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/737-MAX-RTS-Preliminary-Summary-v-1.pdf).\n\nThere were 7 different safety items addressed in the report. The biggest issue was the Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor and the way it allowed the pilots to interact with the plane. This sensor would basically override any actions the Pilots wanted to take and the false readings lead to the crashes years ago. The AOA sensor is manufactured by a private company called Rosemount Aerospace.\n\nAnother issue was with the \"maneuvering characteristics augmentation system\" (MCAS) which is the flight control system that is heavily impacted by all the sensors on the plane (especially the AOA).\n\nLooking forward, the FAA has clearly stated requirements that will allow the 737 MAX to return to flight around the world. they are:\n\n*  Completion of all TAB return to service (RTS) recommendations and acceptance by the TAB of those completed actions. (these are the 7 things about AOA and MCAS)\n* Completion by BA and Acceptance by FAA the new regulatory requirements\n* Official revisions to documentation/training for the 737 MAX\n\nAdditionally, there are specific requirements before it can fly in the US:\n\n* For delivered/yet to be delivered 737s, all FAA changes must be incorporated and updated based on the above changes\n* All Pilots must be trained and certified on the new changes BA will be making to aircraft operation.\n\nAfter this is compelte, FAA will issue a  Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC) (example [here](https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/media/CAN-2019-05.pdf)). this basically tells the international 737 MAX owners to:\n\n*  strongly encouraged to mandate the pilot training identified in the 737 MAX FSB report as a minimum starting point\n* be responsible for the continued airworthiness and continued operational safety (COS) of aircraft on its registry \n\nThe rest of the report breaks down in engineering terms what is wrong and how it is going to be fixed.\n\n**TL;DR: FAA is making BA rework all of its 737 MAXs. BA will likely be taking those cost directly out of its own profit margins. Buy calls / stock on their top suppliers, who BA will have to pay for all the new equipment\\***\n\n[**BA TOP SUPPLIERS**](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionNO4.php?supply&amp;code=BA)\n\n* TAITRON COMPONENTS - TAIT (no options)\n* MSFT - whatever you retards are buying for Tik Tok is fine. Leaps will be good here as well\n* TSM - Jan21 80c should work. if you are cheap do 90\n* Intel - more importantly AMD is a supplier and they will eat intel's lunch. Dell and IBM also provide them chips.\n* other big defense companies that subcontract, LMT, NOC, RTX etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*DISCLAIMER**: I am not an engineer, I am a retarded PFA for a DFEN company. I do not have any active positions from above. I will be waiting for a red day to get in.",

        "selftext": "First off, not sure if this type of post is allowed here to just hoping for the best. Thanks for reading if you decide to. I just want to get some frustrations off my chest, and feel like writing it down will help me move on. To preface, I am turning 30 this year to help put all of these numbers in perspective.\n\nI started trading stocks in early 2017. I deposited $5,000 into my account and looked at all my possibilities. Being a gamer, naturally my watch list included the likes of Nvidia, AMD, INTC, ATVI, EA and what else was I familiar with? Tech, so it also included the likes of FB, APPL, NFLX, etc. At this point you get the picture. So now you're probably saying to yourself, almost every single one of these stocks has rocketed since 2017, did I misread his title? No, you didn't. This is where my stupidity takes over. \n\nAlthough I only started with a $5,000 deposit, I've held a well paying desk job since 2017. By no means am I struggling financially, which ultimately was my downfall for trading. Since I had a well paying job, but no capital going into trading, my mentality was all wrong. I thought I had to go for life changing money instead of the 'safe' bets. My thought was, 5-10% a year wasn't going to pay off my student debt, buy a car, nor put a large down payment on a home and theoretically if I lost it all, I would still be financially stable. Enter penny stocks... I took out all my money in the companies that I knew well, and started researching risky penny plays. Montage time: my timing is always off; I chase the profits; I sell out of fear; the nagging of hindsight eats away at every trade I make; I play swings and then miss the big jump. I make every mistake in the book and refuse to learn from them. Stupid decision after stupid decision. Ultimately, I decided to hold onto bags instead of moving to the stable opportunities staring me in the face. Fast forward 3 years later, I have been able to add a total of $70k in cash to my portfolio, but am currently sitting at a market value of $43k. Obviously this isn't terrible, but when considering the market as a whole since 2017, it has been a huge failure. I am finally done, I tried and failed to 'make it big'. \n\nI am currently researching more stable plays and debating if I missed the boat on all the tech stocks I was watching in the beginning.\n\nIf you want to know more specifics I would be happy to provide but knew this was getting long already. Also before you jump to attack me, I know my balance (and more importantly my job) is still very lucky to have at all in the current state of the world. I am thankful for what I have but I let greed get the better of me for far too long. Hopefully I can stop squandering what I have now.",

Problem was the rest of the market had gained more and I was (and am) too proud to willingly take a loss on my experiment, and it's gotten worse since.\n\nSo, I've been dollar cost averaging in, about 0.30% of my cash per trading day into stocks, hoping for a dip or downward trend to get back in at my original sell point (about 5% below on US, 3% on ex-US). Right now, I'm also DCA 0.60% per trading day into bond indexes to get potential value for the dead money I have sitting, I plan to dump them if I can lump sum back into the market. Any other ideas to hedge my bets? Looked at alternative index ETFs, but no matter what they are, they seem to follow the rest of the market too closely. Selling puts on the funds I want doesn't really garner a premium worth the lack of flexibility. Pricing of precious metals seems too erratic. ETFs that sell covered calls like QYLD seem like an okay idea for a hedge if I tread lightly.

        "selftext": "I want to discuss my strategy with you my beloved redditors and get some opinions for inspiration.\n\nPersonal situation: 30 yo married no kids\nI am a lawyer in germany. My wife has a very advanced understanding of work life balance and works only 24/h. She doesnt excpect me to work more then her. She values sparetime. Im totaly fine with it. I just have higher materialistic goals then her. \n\nI am working for 1 year now and i am partner in a small chancellery.\n\nTotal income after taxes wife (21k \u20ac) me (50k): 61k/y or 5k/m\nCost of living per month: 1.4k \n\nWe are both very ecenomical and are sitting a house at the beach till the summer of 2023 which allows us to only pay 300\u20ac/m of rent.\n\nMy goal is to be financialy free (1.5m in stocks + maybe 2-3 flats for renting to tourists) at the age of 50 with a payed off house. We want to build the house in 2022 so we can move in in 2023. \n\nOur house will cost us aproximatly 800k-900k. Its expensive here at the beach but we want the quality of life not to go down.\n\nI dont care about prestige. I will drive used cars worth 5k forever. If i have to show off in front of clients i rent a car or use the car of one of my partners and pay them something.\n\nIn 2019 we both finished the law exams and started working in august 2023.\n\nWe started with 10k cash 1 year ago. Started investing in Dec 2019.\n\nPortfolio:\n\n20k Cash\n\n40k stocks\n\nMSFT 12k (up 10%)\n\nAmzn 9k (up 72%)\n\nGoogl 6k (up 3%)\n\nMA 6k (up 13%)\n\nJPM 2k (down 5%)\n\nINTC 5k (down 17%)\n\nOPTION A: \nWe have the chance to buy a 71sqm flat 100m from the beach for 250k. Its build in 1970 and we need to invest 50k to make it a modern and flooded with light. \n\nMy father is an architect. He can help us for free. The price is ok'ish in this overheated market.\n\nOur plan is to use the flat as a vacation rental. This would pay for mortgage and all expenses and leave ~ 100 \u20ac/m of free cash flow. We can rent it for 150\u20ac/d in the summertime. I expect 160 booked days per year.\n\nPos: \n-we  create a steady small income stream\n- after 20 years we payed off the mortgage and have a nice asset\n- we use debt to create wealth which ensures we dont suffer under a possible hyperinflation in our allocation phase before we invest our money into our own house\n\nCons:\n- additional effort for renting the flat  via airbnb\n- i would have to sell all my stocks right now\n- risk of things like roof damage and other unforseen things\n- all savings are bound in the flat\n- maybe not enough savings until we plan to buy our own property in 2022\n- my own inexperience concerning this matter\n\nOPTION B:\n\nWe dont buy the flat and keep investing 1k/ month in etfs waiting for a nice entry points like in march and save up via this way until we buy our property.\n\nI am interested in your comments! \nSry for my bad english skills. \n\nHave a nice saturday",

        "selftext": "Sorry if this is a stupid question. \n\nI recently got into stocks during COVID. I purchased some shares of TMobile (TMUS), but then decided I didn't want it. I put a limit order to fill at 'x' price a few weeks ago.  I also own some shares of Intel (NTC)... we all know how that's going.  I got freaked out and pulled the trigger to sell all my TMUS shares once it was at a comfortable number for me. So I owned 0 shares.   Then the share price met the limit order value, and sold off another equal number of shares.  So now I'm in the hole and own 'negative' shares? I didn't think this is even possible.  My checking account looks likes I have money from the sell of negative shares, so I tried buying back the stock to balance it back to zero. No luck. When I got to make the purchase, my checking balance is 0.  I'm using stock slices with Schwab.  \n\nWhat do I do? Is there anything I can do? Am I now a target of the TMobile mafia? \n\nAny advice is helpful! Thanks!",

        "selftext": "Long strategies have been quite profitable the last few months, but I'm looking to add some shorts to balance out my deltas. I'm not predicting a second crash, just looking for companies that are likely to decline no matter what. In a crash, they'll just decline more steeply, offsetting losses to long positions... in theory.\n\nFor example, I was thinking of buying puts in MAC ($7-ish)  back when it was around $35. They had been in decline for a long time while their competitors were doing fine.\n\nMaybe INTC? I don't think their troubles will be over soon. If Apple shows that custom ARM chips are superior, others will jump ship. ARM is making inroads even in the enterprise market.  (If NVDA does buy ARM, that would give them a huge advantage: long NVDA. Also long TSM as the actual manufacturer of Apple's custom silicon, but damn it, I should be looking for shorts!)\n\nNNN: It's already gone down quite a lot, but they are still paying a hefty dividend. I'm not sure that's sustainable while people are staying away from malls, and if it's cut, the share price will drop further.\n\nKODK: It was all hype anyway, and it's already on its way down.\n\nAnyone else got some ideas?",
