        "selftext": "There are three fairly basic ways that new traders lose money in 2021:\n\n**1)** They read some elaborate post about how some piece of garbage stock is the next MEME explosion.  To their newbie eyes the extensive DD looked convincing, and the stock is *only* $10 a share right now, so they they buy 1,000 shares.  And then they average down another 1,000. Two months later they are being told by the same people that were wrong about their DD to begin with,  to hold on to the now, $8 stock.  Even worse, they now believe that selling that stock is \"exactly what the evil hedge funds want you to do!\".  A few months after that they are questioning their life choices and stuck with a useless $4 stock.\n\n**2)** Most YouTube videos are geared towards trying to sell you a method of Day Trading that is based on *Gap n Go* strategies.  These methods, while real, are far more difficult than they are made to appear, but yet they are very marketable (i.e. \"how to turn $5,000 into $50,000!\").  Instead what happens is new traders become singularly focused on finding low float, highly shorted stocks that jump up after the open, convinced they are moments away from the next big score.  Once again, months later they are questioning their life choices and stuck with an account that has dropped far below the PDT requirements\n\nAnd finally that brings us to OTM options:\n\n**3)** Slightly more sophisticated than the first two methods of losing your money, this one requires actual thought and analysis.  \n\nThe appeal is obvious - they are cheap.  And if the stock explodes those options can double, triple, etc in value.  \n\nHere's why they don't work - The options themselves have no real value other than the pure premium you are paying.  When *buying* options, your goal should always be to pay as little premium as possible.  Ideally you would have options at total parity (i.e. Stock is at $100 and the $99 Call Option is worth - $1).  \n\nSimple formula here for ITM Options - (Strike Price + Option Price) - Stock Price = Premium you are paying.\n\nSimpler formula for OTM Options - Option Price = Premium you are paying.\n\nSo let's take an example -\n\nYou like **CSCO,** it is smart pick, the daily chart looks good, it is past earnings (and seriously, please stop holding options over earnings) and looks like clear skies ahead.  Two choices:\n\n56 Strike Call, Expires Aug 27th for $2.35\n\n59 Strike Call, Expires Aug 27th for .30 cents\n\nLet's say you are going to spend $500 - so you can get 2 of the 56 Calls or 16 of the 59 Calls.  \n\nIf next week CSCO hardly moves at all (current at $58.22), your 56 calls will be worth $2.22 - a loss of only 13 cents per call or $26.  \n\nHowever, in that same scenario, your 59 calls will expire worthless, a loss of $480.  \n\nOK, let's say CSCO goes up $1 next week, it is now at $59.22 - \n\nYour 56 Calls are now worth $3.22 (at expiration), a profit of .87 per call or $174.\n\nYour 59 calls are now worth .22 a loss of .08 per Call or -$128.\n\n**OTM Options place heavy lifting on the stock to get you to profitability.  You are betting on a huge move in the stock that pull your options ITM faster than Theta strips away their value.**    \n\n***You are almost always better off going with ITM options, that have a Delta of .6 or higher and are at least a week out, if not more.***  \n\nIn fact, if you just stuck to these three rules it would increase you likelihood of success a great deal:\n\n**1) Do not trade Options over earnings, trade them before, trade them after, but do not hold them** ***over*** **the earnings announcement.**\n\n**2) Do not go for the cheaper OTM options, instead choose Calls or Puts that have a higher Delta and are farther out in time.**\n\n**3) Do not trade Option Spreads unless you know how to leg out of them if they do not go your way.**\n\n(the 3rd one may seem like a small issue, but the number of people that get stuck in spreads they do not know how to exit is alarmingly high).\n\nThis advice may seem basic to some traders here, but if you look at the posts on this forum you will quickly see that the foundational rules you may have been following as a trader aren't as obvious as you think.  New traders clearly do not know these basic principles and we should stop assuming they do.",

        "selftext": "I posted [my July earnings trading report](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/ov71vv/my_july_earnings_report/) last month, and many of you were kind enough to share your thoughts with me.\n\nTLDR: My July results were almost a scratch, $93 into a positive column, and I was undecided if trading earnings is a worthwhile thing.\n\nFast forward to the end of August\u2026 I couldn\u2019t keep away from earnings, just love trading them.\n\nHere are my August stats:\n\n* 21 earnings trades (short condors and strangles, all small positions, average BPu $532.85 per position)\n* 19 wins and 2 losses. A win rate - 90%. Better than July\u2019s 77%. A little experience helps!\n* My wins brought in $567.68\n* Losses took away $104.00\n* Net profit $463.68.\n\nWins: ABNB, BBY, CRM, CSCO, DASH, GPS, HPQ, INTU, M, MRVL, NVDA, PTON, SNOW, SPLK, TGT, TJX, ULTA, URBN, WDC\n\nLosses: LOW, JWN\n\nThe wins are great - no doubt. But it is the losses that are really interesting and have a high learning value. My losses show my indecision between two lines of thought: to defend a losing trade or to exit ASAP to minimize the loss. I have seen convincing arguments for both approaches, and am not yet sure where I stand on this.\n\nI managed my losing LOW trade fairly well in the beginning, brought it from several hundred down to around $30 loss. I could have brought it to a win, but I made a mistake - misread where I was standing and exited for a small loss. I learned how to read the position correctly and did another losing trade right - turned it into a win.\n\nI decided to take a loss on JWN because my overall win rate for August was around 93% and I thought I could afford a small loss. But now I think it could\u2019ve been managed and perhaps turned. But we\u2019ll never know if it could and if I had the skill to do it.\n\nWhere do you stand on this question? Do you defend? Or take a loss and move on to the next trade?",

I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment!

This week they are pricing about an 11% move:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qu59wp9mekh71.png?width=565&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a51ad69536d9442e7ffdeb824397fd0b52442e5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings\n\nSome earnings of note this week include Nvidia, Cisco, Home Depot and Target.

Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing).

If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know!

Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials.

Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out!

Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business.

Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing.

        "selftext": "(TSX:WELL)\n\nI\u2019m sure everyone has heard a lot about WELL Health - it was a pretty hot stock a couple months ago but I haven\u2019t been seeing much on them recently. I guess the novelty of the company started to wear off and people began to ask if WELL could continue to rise over the long term or if it was just a one-time thing due to the increased demand for virtual healthcare services amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The company has clearly done a great job recently with the expansions and acquisitions that they have been pursuing, including CRH and MyHealth, in order to diversify their exposure and I think WELL\u2019s beyond impressive Q2 results make it safe to say they aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nWELL achieved a record quarterly revenue of $61.8 million during the quarter, compared to revenue of $10.6 million generated during Q2-2020, an increase of 484% driven primarily by the CRH acquisition, which accounted for revenue of $36.7 million during the quarter. The company also produced positive EBITDA for the third consecutive quarter which is a great sign. With their own portfolio of over 25 clinics plus over 40 that were added from their acquisition of MyHealth, they are now the largest outpatient clinic operator in Canada. From a patient perspective, WELL\u2019s omni-channel patient visits grew by 19 per cent from quarter-to-quarter, registering 559,008 total visits in the quarter with in-person visits accounting for 43 per cent of the quota.\n\nLast month, WELL formed WELL Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary that\u2019s purpose is to invest in companies that share WELL\u2019s vision on healthcare. Historically, WELL has been successful at identifying strong businesses to invest in and they hope to use WELL Ventures to continue finding profitable business opportunities.\n\nThe CEO of WELL has also mentioned a NASDAQ listing in October. Recently announced was their partnership with renowned law firm Fenwick &amp; West, which helped Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and Coinbase with their IPOs. This is important because WELL\u2019s equivalents in the US are currently trading at much higher multiples making this a unique opportunity to get on the gains. Once WELL goes live on the NASDAQ, US funds will be hammering this stock.\n\nFor a deeper dive into their Q2 results, check out: [https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/well-health-achieves-record-revenue-and-adjusted-ebitda-in-q2-2021-with-484-yoy-revenue-growth-and-615-growth-in-its-adjusted-gross-profit-868134844.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/well-health-achieves-record-revenue-and-adjusted-ebitda-in-q2-2021-with-484-yoy-revenue-growth-and-615-growth-in-its-adjusted-gross-profit-868134844.html)\n\nThis is not financial advice, if you are interested in the company look into them!",
