        "selftext": "Every now and then, a pennystock comes around that makes you think: How the hell is this a pennystock? How is this valued so low?\n\nWell my coworkers and I have been trading for a long time, and this is very likely one of them. *(Computer geeks are going to love this especially).*\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$OSS, One Stop Systems, since its IPO in 2018, has been silently building a tech empire behind our backs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*You're gonna lose your literal mind when you read the next part:*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**They are officially partnered with:** Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, Lyft, Puma, Toshiba, Thunderbolt, Universal Audio, Focusrite, and Cisco etc... These are only 15 of their 50+ major international partnerships.\n\n*(yes, this is a pennystock.)*\n\n**U.S. Military:** On top of this, OSS also has multiple million-dollar contracts with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Military, as they provide the pre-constructed systems and power required for AI intelligence, DLSS, and large scale data transfer.\n\n*(This sub goes batshit crazy when a pennystock lands even ONE of the above partnerships. They have more than 50 already in motion.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do they do? What makes them so special?**\n\nOSS in layman\u2019s terms is a company that takes top-end processors and GPUs, and uses their PCIe gen 4.0 expansion technology to merge them into a military-grade/data center supercomputer.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there many companies that can do this? No. They are the only company in the world with a PCIe 4.0 expansion system that can support NVIDIA\u2019s top end GPU\u2019s. (*Nvidia A-100*)\n\nThis means that they own nearly 100% of the market share in Nvidia's latest PCIe GPU technology.\n\n*(PCIe gen 3.0 is the only other option, but is 50% slower than PCIe 4.0.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What else makes them so special?** Their Financials.\n\nCompare their financials to the pennystocks we always talk about on this subreddit. It\u2019s absurd. They ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY.\n\nOSS's latest 10-K showed a record $ 60 MILLION in revenue, a 57% increase YoY.\n\nSome of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, took over 10 years to make their first dollar. \n\nOSS is only on YEAR 2 and they are only $1 MILLION away from becoming a profitable operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is this possible?** Three reasons:\n\n1. They completely dominate the high-end PCIe sector of the tech industry. I challenge you to find a single other PCIe 4.0 expansion system on the market.\n2. Their CEO David Raun has led two companies to record revenues in the PCIe and NVMe industry, and one was bought out by Broadcom.\n3. They are at the forefront of far too many industries that require this level of technology.

        "selftext": "With AMD shares hitting a new all-time high today on the back of an earnings beat and raised guidance (as well as Intel's 7nm delay), I thought it would be an opportune time to look back on how amazing of a turnaround story this has really been given that only 7 years ago the company's future was very much in doubt.\n\nIn 2013, ArsTechnica ran a profile on how AMD took on Intel in the late 90s, experienced rousing success with its Athlon and Opteron chips, before over-spending and mis-executing its way into a free fall. Back then, AMD found itself completely out-maneuvered by Intel in the desktop, laptop, and sever markets and had largely been shut out of both smartphone and tablet production.\n\nThis fascinating story features some matchmaking by Bill Gates, a failed attempt by AMD to acquire Nvidia when it traded under $15 a share, and a botched integration with graphics maker ATI Technologies. Warning: the two-part article, while super interesting, is absolutely on the lengthy side. For those of you who like the quick-hitters, I've summarized the highlights below.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-amd-how-an-underdog-stuck-it-to-intel/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-amd-how-an-underdog-stuck-it-to-intel/)\n\n* During the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier for companies using Intel processors. Companies like IBM didn't want to rely solely on Intel for one of the primary components in their computers, so they licensed AMD to produce versions of Intel processors. However in 1985, Intel stopped giving AMD its designs which forced them to reverse-engineer versions of Intel parts. By 1990, Merrill Lynch had declared AMD \"dead\", as the smaller company couldn't keep up with Intel product releases. This would not be the last time, as its aggressive pricing throughout the first half of the 90s had left AMD in a poor financial position. \n* In 1994, a tiny Silicon Valley outfit named NexGen began shipping a chip that was comparable to Intel's flagship Pentium. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates had taken an interest in NexGen, in particular, its brilliant CEO, Atiq Raza. Gates suggested that Raza speak to AMD since the company owned a chip fab but needed a better product to build in it. Raza met with then-CEO Jerry Sanders, who threatened to run NexGen out of business. Upon hearing about the exchange, Gates picked up the phone, called Sanders, and convinced AMD to purchase NexGen for $615mn in 1995. Soon after, Raza, dubbed by Sanders as the \"Michael Jordan of microprocessor design\", helped AMD develop the K6 - a major turning point for the company.\n* The K6 rivaled Intel on speed and price, and its revisions led to one of AMD's most successful architectures: K7, marketed as the Athlon. Athlon received \"CPU of the Year\" in 1999 from ArsTechnica and helped AMD grow sales from $2.5bn in 1998 to $4.6bn by 2000. With the company having just pulled in nearly $1bn in profits, Sanders rented out San Jose's entire HP Pavilion (now the SAP Center) for a party in which he paid for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill to perform and proclaimed AMD's share price would soon hit $100.\n* Around this time the company started spending too much and spreading itself too thin. AMD was making most of its profit from memory, but was also dabbling in logic, microprocessors, and communication products. Sanders had also decided to build a massive fab in Germany with borrowed money. Despite this, AMD continued to find technical success. AMD utilized the Athlon to develop a similar architecture that was more useful for severs. The new product, Opteron, led to AMD capturing an estimated 25% of the server market by 2006 all the while Intel struggled to produce a chip that could compete with the performance advantages of Opteron.\n* While on the surface AMD seemed to be firing on all cylinders with its popular Athlon and Opteron chips, the company was a financial mess behind-the-scenes. The company announced net losses of $61mn in 2001, $1.3bn in 2002, and $274mn in 2003. The main culprit? Investments in fabs that grossly overshot initial cost estimates. Between its two locations in Germany, AMD invested roughly $4.6bn.\n* AMD's competitive edge with Opteron coincided with some low points for Intel that forced the company to re-imagine its architecture altogether. The result was the release of the Intel Core microarchitecture in 2006. Core enabled Intel to take back the performance crown in the PC market, and it proved more power-efficient than AMD's laptop chips right when laptops began to outsell desktops for the first time.  Intel compounded the pain by strategically releasing frequent upgrades and forcing AMD to play catch-up yet again. \n* Though AMD's CPUs consistently improved, over time they became shut out of the high-end market once more and were relegated to compete mainly on price, mirroring the company's early struggles. As Intel churned out its best product in years, AMD began trying to swallow another company whole. In 2006, AMD saw an opportunity for the future by integrating a memory controller into the CPU. However, the company needed the graphics and chipset experience to make it happen.\n* The solution was to purchase Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies for $5.4bn - or roughly half of AMD's market cap. This came after AMD had approached Nvidia as its first-choice takeover target. At that time, Nvidia was trading under $15 a share. But Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia's outspoken CEO, insisted on running the combined company \u2014 a non-starter for AMD leadership. While ATI's technology was considered superior to Intel's, the integration process proved disastrous from the start. Employees from the two companies divided into green (AMD and CPU) and red (ATI and GPU) sides, prioritizing needs of their individual products, and causing major delays time and time again. \n* With problems executing and stagnant sales, AMD ended 2007 with more than $5bn in debt and lost $3.3bn on the year after having taken a write-down charge for its acquisition of ATI. The company was having serious difficulty affording the costs of its fab facilities, when the entire industry endured a sharp downturn in 2008 that caused the stock to plummet from $20 to $4 a share. \n* AMD had no choice but to spin off its foundries in 2009 (AMD spun off GlobalFoundries in 2009), weakening its competitive positioning relative to Intel. Despite efforts to engineer higher quality products, its share of the PC and sever businesses kept declining and AMD was unable to achieve meaningful share in the ultrabook and tablet segments. The low-end CPU market sent margins tumbling and increased exposure to secular declines in PC sales. \n* By 2013, only one singular analyst on Wall Street was bullish on the stock \u2014 which had now fallen from $8 at the start of 2012 to just around $2. Yet after a major delay with the highly anticipated \"Fusion\" 32nm chip, the analyst noted that there were now liquidity concerns due to the declining PC market. Even former CFO Fran Barton thought AMD had next to no future in its battle with Intel: \"***...the game's been played.***\"\n\nFlash-forward to today and AMD just delivered its highest CPU revenue in over 12 years, has taken CPU market share for 11 straight quarters, and currently enjoys double-digit server processor market share. Whether you're an investor or not, bullish or bearish, that is one hell of a comeback. Hats off to Lisa Su and the entire AMD team.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR - Some dude tries to solve the crazy market with his sh*tty pros and cons list on BRK. Nothing to see here, move along.\n\n\nTo my favorite group of autists,\n\nWhile we wait for our brothers to post tendie porns with $2000 7/10 calls on Tesla, let me ask you - what the *** is going on with Berkshire Hathway?!\nI can't help wanting to go all in on BRK Jan'21 calls and I need someone to stop me. I just do not understand why BRK has been bashed so bad; all the things I see on BRK just makes me feel so good about it. Trust me, I get that people hate the 90 year old dude for not spending his billions of pocket money on TSLA calls, but all I have been reading about BRK looks so well setup to rocket but since it did not yet - what am I missing?\n\nHere's my pros and cons list:\n\nPros\n----\n1. Divested from Goldman Sachs in Q1 - Seeing that GS and MS had the worst stress test results, didn't the old man see this coming long time ago?\n2. Only reported holdings till 31 March 2020 in their latest reporting on 15-May-2020 - Couldn't they have bought lots of dip in the first week of April without any of us knowing?\n3. Geico (owned by BRK) is hiring like cray (ain't it Jay! what she order? fish fillet) - Why are people freaking out about increased litigation and insurance losses?\n4. Bought Natgas assets for $10B - No idea if its a pro or a con, most are confused, but why not put it in Pro to cater to my confirmation bias?! right?! But seriously, storage of natgas is bound to make money because the buyers gotta store it somewhere even if its not selling, isn't it a win-win?\n5. Owns 5% of Apple making half of BRK's non-cash portfolio - So it's OK to give a 30x PE multiple to AAPL but not even close to someone whose portfolio is half that asset? What sorcery is this?\n6. Board Member buying $2Mn of stocks in May - To be honest, this looks like she added an extra zero by mistake. It happens. But man, isn't that a bullish signal?\n7. None of the investment banks are giving it a buy rating - Good that banks ain't pumping this no?\n8. Robinhooders are jumping from TSLA to BRK and the likes - This honestly is stupid, we all know TSLA is definitely worth 3000 by August.\n9. Sector Rotation - Are we all planning to send the tech stocks higher? Or do we now want to cash out and put our money in Banks.. err.. I mean other assets?\n10. August Earnings - When BRK took a $ -50 Bn charge in May GAAP earnings, stock plummetted to record like crazy. Now that the stock market is up, wouldn't the GAAP earning be excess of $ 40Bn dollars (including AAPL). Plus, wouldn't insurance earnings be higher due to lower claims (auto and home) in Q2?\n11. Banks - All banks are in very good shape (except WFC), wouldn't all the major holdings go back to normal by 2022? (maybe buy 2022 calls instead?)\n12. Ackman says he would have stayed put if not for Lowes offerring a better hedge for him?\n13. Sustainable Energy - Isn't it generally agreed upon that sustainable energy sources are going to skyrocket in the near future? If that's true, Berkshire Energy looks well positioned with majority sustainable assets? Am I seeing this right?\n14. Electric Vehicles investment in BYD back in 2008 - Didn't this skyrocket like all the other electric stuff?\n\nCons\n-----\n1. Got duped twice for more than $1.2Bn - German Solar Company and German Wilhelm Schulz - Well, that's stupid.\n2. Giving billions to charity at this time - They're going to sell the shares to send this plummetting.\n3. Buffett waiting for second wave - In his annual meeting he said he wants to 'come out of this crisis' with plenty of liquidity, does this mean he will not participate at all?\n4. Airline Losses - Why would he ever bet on Airline industry? There was no way Airlines would have ever fit his hypothesis of higher margins and lower valuations. He now says the industry changed significantly at a low probability event, but why was that attractive in the first place? I think he lost ~40% of his $10Bn he invested in the sector?\n5. Oil Sector - Well, I guess this was a good bet, but still a big loss for him. Not sure how much it cost him.\n6. Stock Momentum - The stock barely moves (even in the last 10 years). This put me to sleep. Grr...\n7. Buffett's reasoning - In an interview, when asked about why Apple is a good investment but IBM was not, he went on a tanget to say Apple is a product loved by others. Wasn't IBM one 10 years ago? This makes me think that the age is catching up to him.\n\n\n\nSo, let me ask again - what the *** is going on with BRK? why no tendies yet?\n---------------------------------------------",

        "selftext": "After this fiasco of an ER and 7nm delay announcement, Intc received 9 downgrades with multiple sell ratings. \n\nThis stock feels like BA, GE, IBM, WFC  - a titan that has lost its way. \n\nI am curious what is the best and fastest way for the stock to regain momentum? If you say execute on chip production, then that\u2019s at least 2-3 years before we know if they are back on course. Their history with the 10nm delays gives no one any faith that they will be able to right the ship after their announced 6 month delay. If anything, analysts fear the delay will get extended again and again. Listen to the conference call. \n\nSo how does INTC right the stock quickly?\n\nI see these options from other titans ....\n\n1) fire CEO and the VPs responsible for delays\n\n2) increase dividends\n\n3) increase share buyback \n\n4) announce transparency initiative- yields , roadmap , etc. \n\n5) add directors that will hold execs accountable. \n\n\n6 months ago, the 7nm was coming along great. Now, it\u2019s delayed. The market doesn\u2019t believe in Intc anymore. Any positive news they come out from now till 2023 (new 7nm launch) will not be believed.",

        "selftext": "Interesting note: 2010-2020 was a time of a huge shift in mindset of investors and landscale of large companies.[For biggest part of 20th century, stock market was dominated by the same names](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/documents/F_2010_April_Fifty_Years_of_RAFI.pdf): AT&amp;T, Exxon, General Motors, IBM, General Electric. For 35 years from 1960 till 1995, these 4 companies rotate each other in TOP-3 list by market cap. \n\nIn 2000s after dot com bubble, new names enters the list. We start seeing Microsoft, Walmart, Pfizer, Merk, big banks like Citigroup of Bank of America, while IBM drops off, but still Exxon and GE keeps their presence.\n\n2010 list was [dominated by high oil prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization): Exxon, PetroChina, Royal Dutch Shell, Petrobas. \n\nAnd in 2010s the dramatic of change was unprecedented. Just **in 10 years, 8 out of 10 top market cap companies drops from the list**. The only 2 who remain are Microsoft &amp; Apple. Now list consists of 7 tech stocks (even 8, if we count Visa as a tech company due to the full IT dependence of its payment system), with only JNJ and BRK as non-tech left.\n\nIn the entire market history it was never the case like this. 10 years which changed absolutely everything on the market. \n\nHence, the question: *do you think FAAGM will dominate the world in next decade too, or new names (TSLA? NVDA?) are coming to take to royal place soon?*\n\nPersonally, in my opinion, current tech area is not properly regulated by anti-monopoly law (especially Facebook, owning information flow of 2bln people, and fully managed by Zuk, who holds majority of shareholders vote), and I will not be surprised to see FB &amp; Google to be divided into different companies like it was century ago with Carnegi &amp; Rockfeller companies. Amazon with P/E close to 150 and extreme low marginality (part of their strategy to kill all competitors, so-called, Amazon effect) eithr should increase marginality soon, or investors might correct the price of the company. Apple will live till new revolution personal device enters the market (NeuraLink?) and only for Microsoft I don't see the way it might fail soon.",

        "selftext": "The current policy of QE (brrrrrrrrr) according to most economic theories would mean that inflation will eventually happen, but will likely be delayed until the economy begins to reopen and spending recovers. \n\nTo avoid crowding out non-government debt, the Fed has stepped into risky bond markets and started buying those bonds to increase liquidity, this has some effect of delaying inflation but that balance sheet will unwind slowly.\n\nAnyway, if we assume that inflation will rise at a higher level that we saw in the last few years, the real winners will be people and companies with huge amounts of debt that are able to maintain enough cash flow to pay those obligations.  Their debts will be eroded by inflation, and taking on enormous amounts of debt will likely result in windfall profits assuming what they financed with debt appreciates at the same level of inflation (think share buy backs).\n\n\"the proportion of buybacks funded by corporate bonds reached as high as 30% in both 2016 and 2017,\u00a0\".[1]. So, by taking out loans to buy stock, which will keep pace with inflation, the companies that have participated in this behavior will stand to make huge returns, at the expense of the debt holders (at this point the fed and anyone with a savings account). \n\nSo, what are some companies that stand to benefit from this?  Any company with a huge amount of debt, little cash on hand, a large number of repurchased shares, and a strong enough business model to not default on debt. \n\nThese are the stocks I think would fall into that category.  It's important to note that companies like MSFT and APPL sitting on mountains of cash may be forced into share buybacks to avoid inflation, thus further driving up their stock prices as well.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS)\nCharter Communications (CHTR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nComcast Corp. (CMCSA)\n\nOracle Corp. (ORCL)\n\nIBM Corp. (IBM)\n\nFord Motor Co. (F)\n\nI'd be interested what your thoughts are? \n\nTldr; inflation goes up. Companies with debt that don't default will be rewarded. Companies that might default probably bailed out and rewarded also. Companies with lots of cash will have their value eroded.

        "selftext": " IBM Corp. (**IBM**) reported better-than-estimated profit in the second quarter driven by sales of its cloud computing business sending shares up almost 5% in extended market trading on Monday.\n\nThe stock surged to $132.25 in Monday\u2019s after-market trading. IBM\u2019s total revenue in the second quarter dropped 5.4% to $18.12 billion year-on-year, coming in above analysts\u2019 estimates of $17.72 billion. Adjusting for the impact from currency and divested businesses, revenue slipped 1.9%. Meanwhile total cloud revenue surged 30% to $6.3 billion in the reported quarter.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $2.18 per share, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations for $2.07 per share. IBM\u2019s focus of investment has been its hybrid cloud transition and AI as clients modernize their businesses and need to enhance their work-at-home capabilities in today\u2019s COVID-19 environment.\n\nShares in IBM, which have climbed 6% in the past 5 days, are still down 5.7% year-to-date.\n\n[https://www.tipranks.com/news/ibm-pops-5-in-extended-trading-after-quarterly-profit-beats-expectations/](https://www.tipranks.com/news/ibm-pops-5-in-extended-trading-after-quarterly-profit-beats-expectations/)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 20th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/17/earnings-and-fiscal-debate-could-be-catalysts-for-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors are braced for a barrage of earnings news, and the debate in Washington around the next stimulus package may also be an important catalyst for markets since it has implications for the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Big tech names, including Microsoft, Intel, Twitter and IBM, are among companies reporting in the week ahead, as is high-flying Tesla. Blue chips Coca-Cola, Verizon, American Express and Travelers are also among the dozens of major companies releasing results.\n*****\n&gt; Congress returns from its break and should pick up the pace of negotiations towards a new fiscal stimulus package, which is expected to address aid for state and local governments and enhanced unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits, including the $600 additional weekly payment now going to millions, is expected to be a hot topic of discussion, as the benefit ends on July 31.\n*****\n&gt; There are just a few items of note on the economic calendar, including existing home sales on Wednesday, unemployment claims data on Thursday and new home sales on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The spread of the coronavirus will also be closely monitored, as well as any signs of medical progress. The Lancet medical journal is expected to release early stage human trial data Monday on a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018Push and pull\u2019 in market\n&gt; Investors also will be watching the market\u2019s own dynamics in the week ahead. There is tension within the market between the bubbly run-up of tech and momentum names on the Nasdaq, and the broader market, or S&amp;P 500, which is basically still flat for the year. The Nasdaq is up 17% year to date, but in the past week lagged other indices, turning in a loss, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were both higher.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s outperformance came to an abrupt end Monday, and it has lagged since then. In dramatic fashion, the index rose sharply to new highs, with many big tech names and Tesla also hitting highs. Within the same session, there was a massive reversal in the index and in tech and momentum names, and they closed sharply lower.\n*****\n&gt; Now strategists are watching to see if the froth will be let out slowly or blow off in a big move that takes the rest of the market with it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe expect the push and pull of the Nasdaq to continue and have sustained volatility, in our view, throughout the earnings season,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. \u201cVolatility could be to the upside, as well as the downside, but in our view, in aggregate, the Nasdaq is likely to correct.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the volatile reversal in the Nasdaq does not bode well for the Nasdaq, and it could see a 10% correction. There\u2019s been a surge of retail activity in some of the frothiest names, such as Tesla, which surged from about $1,000 at the end of June to a high of $1,795 during Monday\u2019s session. It is since about $300 per share lower.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe combination of public participation and just incredible valuations makes the sector very, very vulnerable. ... It\u2019s the sector with the highest earnings expectations,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThere\u2019s virtually nothing that management can say at these valuations that\u2019s going to create further upside to these names.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tesla and Microsoft report earnings Wednesday, and Twitter reports Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; # A bump up in stimulus\n&gt; As Congress heads back to Washington in the coming week, expectations are rising that the fiscal stimulus package could be slightly more than Republicans were previously expected to approve.\n*****\n&gt; When Congress broke for the July 4 holiday, there was a big divide on how much stimulus should be added, on top of the $2.4 trillion already adopted. The Democratic proposal was for $3 trillion, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said no more than $1 trillion. Now the gulf has narrowed, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the $1.3 trillion under discussions is not enough.\n*****\n&gt; Cornerstone Macro\u2019s Andy Laperriere said the package could now be $1.5 trillion or more, more than he expected just several weeks ago. He said more money is now expected for state and local governments, local schools, public health, virus testing and payments to support individuals..\n*****\n&gt; \u201cRepublicans really want to use this bill to encourage and incentivize businesses and schools to open. But I think the big thing is a month ago, the top priority of Republicans was to keep this bill small,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; One of the most controversial elements of the CARES stimulus package was the $600 weekly payment to people who were already collecting unemployment.\n*****\n&gt; The payment is likely to be significantly reduced and then ultimately phased out, but that will only come after compromise. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some lines-in-the-sand issues, and this is one of them,\u201d said Laperriere, head of policy at Cornerstone.\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump has said he won\u2019t sign the bill unless there is a payroll tax cut, which was previously rejected by Congress. Payroll taxes are paid by both employers and employees, and they fund government programs, including Medicare and Social Security.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market could react to the deliberations if they take longer than expected, or the funds are viewed as insufficient.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, Wells Fargo director of rate strategy, said the bond market will focus on how quickly the government plans to payout the stimulus and also the degree to which the Treasury will ultimately have to increase auction sizes to pay for it.\n*****\n&gt; If Congress keeps to its schedule, it needs to approve the package before the end of the month, when it heads to another recess for the entire month of August.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/X7dY3T7L/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/v81m24Jp/alphatrends717202.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/gcf2CYdr/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/FstWbdq4/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YCx2LYFm/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/q7MJsqcD/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/qM09hYxj/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/v85JmMf4/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/xTm8QYrx/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/QdgGnDxL/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/52WW3yJq/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/RVHzKfkZ/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Good and the Bad from Earnings This Week\n\n&gt; Earnings season began at the start of this week with Pepsi (PEP) and the first of the major US banks and brokers reporting Q2 numbers. It was a light week with only 32 companies reporting through Thursday, but in the coming weeks, we'll see 100+ reports on multiple trading days.\n\n&gt; From our Earnings Explorer tool, below is a recap of the results from this week's earnings reports. 78% of companies that reported this week beat consensus analyst EPS estimates, while 72% topped consensus sales estimates. Those are both strong numbers. In terms of future projections, 16% of companies raised guidance, and not one company lowered guidance. That's rare even with the very low number of reports so far.\n\n&gt; While guidance and beat rates were strong, investors still used earnings reports as an opportunity to sell. The average one-day share price change this week for companies in reaction to their earnings reports was a decline of 0.57%. All of those declines came on the initial gap down at the open, however. After averaging a gap down of 0.76% at the open of trading following the earnings release, the average stock that reported gained 0.21% from the open to the close. (The gap down of 0.76% and the open to close gain of 0.21% adds up to the full-day decline of 0.57% mentioned earlier.)\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/earnings.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing all 32 companies that reported Q2 numbers this week (through Thursday). The list is sorted by one-day share price reaction from best to worst. Alcoa (AA) had the best price reaction to earnings this week with a gain of 6.39% yesterday. WNS Global (WNS) put up the second-biggest gain at 6.36%. The next best-performing stocks in reaction to earnings this week only gained 3%+ -- USB and HOMB. Other stocks that reported this week that gained in response to their earnings reports include Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), Taiwan Semi (TSM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and JP Morgan (JPM).\n\n&gt; On the downside, AngioDynamics (ANGO) saw the worst share price reaction to earnings this week when it fell 11.51% on Thursday. Sleep Number (SNBR) was second-worst with a one-day drop of 9.19% yesterday as well.\n\n&gt; While MS, GS, and JPM all posted gains in reaction to earnings this week, other banks like Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) reacted negatively with each falling 4% or more.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/companies.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Retail Sales Beat Again\n\n&gt; Retail sales data for June was reported on Thursday, handily beating expectations for the second consecutive month. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, June saw a 7.5% increase month over month, compared with Bloomberg\u2019s consensus expectations for a 5% gain. This comes on the heels of a more than 18% gain in May, but also following by far the lowest reading ever, a 14.7% decline in April.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.17.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Pent-up demand and the continued easing of lockdowns during June likely contributed to the large increase, which saw sales rise across most categories. Sales spiked 8.2% at auto dealers, but even sales excluding autos and gas rose 6.7%. Clothing store sales more than doubled (+105.1%) while sales in the hard-hit food services and drinking places climbed 20%.\n\n&gt; \u201cConsumer spending is still far below pre-pandemic levels and many of the real-time data we are monitoring have begun to level off in the past month,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe remain encouraged by the strong rebound in May and June, but would expect more gradual gains for retail sales in the second half of the year.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# Why A Potential Democrat Sweep May Not Be A Market Worry\n\n&gt; Based on the latest polling data, there\u2019s growing consensus that former Vice President Joe Biden potentially may win the election and Democrats possibly may sweep Congress. Some might think this could be a negative for stocks, as a higher corporate tax rate that reduces earnings could be part of the Democratic platform.\n\n&gt; Early writers of the US Constitution were worried about one party having too much power that could enable factions in Washington, DC, to enact more extreme policies and political ideals, upsetting the carefully balanced apple cart. As we noted in our recently released Midyear Outlook 2020, stocks historically have performed quite well when Congress has been split, although stocks actually have done better than most probably realized when the Democrats were in full control.\n\n&gt; \u201cHigher corporate taxes are quite likely should we see a potential Democratic sweep,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut to blindly say stocks will do poorly is quite a stretch, as historically stocks have done rather well under this .\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher 9 of the past 10 times and 15 of the past 18 times Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress. Although LPL Research anticipates a likely split Congress in November, with the list of overall worries growing, we don\u2019t think a potential Democratic sweep should be at the top of investors\u2019 list of worries.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.15.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best of July Likely Over\n\n&gt; NASDAQ\u2019s mid-year rally came to an end on Tuesday, July 14. During the rally\u2019s 12-day stretch beginning on the third to last day of June through the ninth trading day in July, NASDAQ gained 4.7%. This is well above its average performance since 1985 but less than half of its best showing from 1999. At NASDAQ\u2019s high close during the rally on July 10 it was up 6.0%. Historically around this time in July is when the market has begun to weaken as NASDAQ\u2019s full-month average performance is just 0.9% since 1985.\n\n&gt; In the following chart, July\u2019s seasonal pattern over the last 21 years has been plotted with July 2020, plotted on the right axis for comparison through yesterday\u2019s close. This July\u2019s well above average performance so far called for a second, larger range in order to aid in the comparison. Over the last 21 years the market\u2019s trend has been lower beginning right around mid-month through the close. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 &amp; 2000 have on average given back some or all of their first half of July gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a338dcb9c5355ebe07758987a0a3d941/d984701acc1b4792-9e/s540x810/6c7c264a92ed27d9043da27d7ef2acdaa40dbfae.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b0cbc0824312a8c984564b62747031d3/d984701acc1b4792-3d/s500x750/8112f6ccc64548e6c274778901c34992a18b658e.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$NVS** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$MAN** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$CALM** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$TSCO** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$TMO** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$CIT** \n&gt; * **$MKTX** \n&gt; * **$CTXS** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$LLNW** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$CDNS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/xTm8QYrx/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FF8zwz6k/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, JULY 20TH, 2020!](https://i.postimg.cc/x1p7ZdD4/er1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/E6wNTxx.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aGg73Qq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pBhcRIP.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Pdlt5pp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/c5ceAoH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MmWZB8E.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rm0IsJb.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1lXaIJm.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nc5F8qw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Kmrh21e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.24.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4aRpYtr.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Tesla, Inc. -\n&gt; **Tesla, Inc.
