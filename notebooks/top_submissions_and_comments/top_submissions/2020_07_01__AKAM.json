Feedback on my ideas (good idea/bad idea/etc.) and any advice in general is much appreciated. I haven\u2019t looked into anything but single companies thus far, and want to look into other ways to invest but don\u2019t know where to start, so recommendations on where to start would great. \n\nMy ideas thus far:\nVerizon \nClorox\nGeneral dynamics \nNvidia \nSquare \nAkamai\nScott\u2019s Miracle Gro\nAdvanced Micro Devices \nThermo Fisher Scientific\nLockheed Martin \nNorthrop Grumman \n\nI know these are all massive companies and represent value rather than growth investing. I do want to invest in some growth shares, but have no idea where to start. Tech, energy, and defense are my preferred industries because I have good insight into them but honestly any advice and recommendation can do nothing but help. Thanks!",

The overarching theme behind these picks is **American Innovation &amp; Mexican Development.**\n\nI'm a 26 year old fintech engineer in the US and an avocado farmer in Mexico and I hold a strong conviction that investing in Mexican development will reward me well in the decades to come.\n\n**In a nutshell, the USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring and my strategy favors the Texas-Nuevo Leon economy and overall Mexican-American trade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Monterrey, Nuevo Leon\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219352-ec946e00-bb36-11ea-9fc3-b17c9e5b0597.png))\n\nI'm from a rural village south of Jalisco which produces far more agricultural goods like avocados alongside Michoacan.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86219771-7e9c7680-bb37-11ea-98b2-7e8c2833d99a.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very aware of the problems that Mexico faces but I also view Mexico as a sleeping giant that the US utilizes for capital efficiency in global trade.

The economic damage narcotrafficking has delivered has resulted in:\n\n\\- \\[An increasing black market integration into the global money supply, in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, resulting in a growing vacuum of theft AKA the Drug War &amp; Economics of Peace\\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\\_Secrecy\\_Act#Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act#Sanctions))\n\n\\- North American suppressed wage suppression\n\n\\- refugee style illegal immigration\n\n\\- NA workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- Mexican workforce morale decrease\n\n\\- A Mexican workforce and brain drain, as skilled and motivated laborers leave for opportunity and better pay who are loyal to both nations\n\n\\- Multiple events of civil unrest or civil disasters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- National cyncism against the current administration\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see this as a complex problem where most people's perspective is not complete or clouded by one of the reasons above. I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy. It is certainly in a golden era of sorts, and Mexico reflects as a nation in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Economic Framework\n\nI am selecting industries that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Empower the US and have a rippling effect on Mexico\n\n\\- Will fundamentally continue to build and grow the future global supply\n\n\\- Are friendly to primarily German/Euro and Japanese/Asian trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # My Portfolio Structure \n\nThere are two systems at play at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Primary Asset Collection - these are stocks I regularly invest in.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082755-62bca600-ba4d-11ea-8857-95e902f8d0ce.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 12 Competitor Arenas (Cloud Infrastructure Group) - these are stocks that are competing for Primary Asset Allocation each quarter and receive less allocation.\n\n!\\[image\\]([https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/86082923-c3e47980-ba4d-11ea-9543-b31eb000962d.png))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I own 12 primary companies.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

These are the ways the situation can play out as I understand them.\n\n* The stock rises gently or stays the same: I sell calls and make premium. My long call stays the same or declines slowly.\n* The stock rises rapidly: My short call is in the money. I have two choices.\n\n&gt;\tBuy to close and suffer loss, but the rising value of my long call will offset that a bit. Continue selling calls.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\tIf I don't want to suffer that loss, I can keep the position and risk assignment. In the case of assignment, my broker will exercise my long call. I keep the premium from my short call but lose all the extrinsic value of my long call (which would have risen due to the sharp rise in underlying price). I exit the strategy.\n\n* The stock falls: I sell calls and make premium, but not enough to offset the declining value of my long call. At the start I set a threshold on how much I'm willing to lose (factoring in premium gained from shorting calls) and exit the position if that limit is passed, or exit if I don't have faith in the underlying.\n* The stock falls rapidly: Same as above but I lose more quickly.\n\nThe thing I am most unsure about is how the long call acts in this situation. Basically the point of this strategy is to sell risky enough calls to outpace theta decay on your long call? I'm making a lot of assumptions here because I lack experience, but this seems like a bad strategy with a lot of ways to go negative or barely make profit. Is that true?",

I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed.

The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

Earnings SZN is upon us and the time is now to bring forth our genius into the markets. I\u2019ll go through some of the volume I caught as well as unusual activity.\n\nIf you want to check out the option tool for yourself, go to [SwaggyStocks Option Flow](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices**\n\nAMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There\u2019s been an uptick in the semi\u2019s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waa6l9l0eia51.png?width=2954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c91c65e472b0cbedb5ea16ec1364461f0253788\n\n**DKNG \u2013 DraftKings**\n\nDraftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6lfh0a4eia51.png?width=2820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7fa4b5fd9ceba04c86e6058347745f80fb3f8e\n\n**KO \u2013 Coca Cola**\n\nBig call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn\u2019t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbbuv0c6eia51.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060882c26d52ab5fa1299180734ee53eaf836135\n\n**INTC \u2013 Intel Corporation**\n\nI caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It\u2019s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoylbk3heia51.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f226af023a53ddf266b16f5dcc3ab3c3d7a38f0\n\n**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**\n\nDidn\u2019t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven\u2019t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We\u2019ll find out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ykbro4jeia51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69dca10f7af71ff807544c27f16675fbf4311ea2",

        "selftext": "**Graf Industrial** $GRAF announced its plan to merge with a maker of laser sensors for self-driving vehicles, Velodyne Lidar. The business has good credentials with over 300 customers including Ford and Mercedes.  Following the merger Ford, Hyundai and Nikon will hold 80% of the stock.  The valuation at 18x revenues is not cheap and reflects 60% annual growth expectations.  Velodyne\u2019s impressive list of backers and customers gives credibility to those forecasts. \n\n**Micron**'$MU reported earnings  that beat expectations with sequential improvement and guided to growth next quarter. Revenues were up 13% while adjusted EPS grew 80%.  It\u2019s the first sequential improvement for six months and a good indicator that the memory chip cycle may be on the turn.  Chip manufacturers have been cutting capacity but now the 5G phone cycle is driving a big increase in DRAM and NAND bits per phone and the new Xbox and PlayStation consoles should also provide a boost.\n\n**My Size** $MYSZ, is a highly speculative mobile device measurement solutions provider for e-commerce fashion.  The company reported this week that two French retail brands, La Pi\u00e8ce and Habillez-moi, are integrating MySizeID into their e-commerce websites in order to increase customer loyalty and reduce returns. My Size offers online retailers innovative measurement and sizing solutions to reduce expensive returns triggered by size errors.  It\u2019s a high risk nanocap with a market capitalization of just $8 million yet has huge potential with its patent protected MySizeID solution that has been licensed by platforms, including Shopify and Lightspeed.  \n\n**Hepion Pharmaceuticals** $HEPA (WARNING SPECULATIVE EARLY STUDY NANO CAP)  jumped on Tuesday after reporting that it was \"exceedingly pleased\" that its CRV431 Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) treatment continues to be very well tolerated throughout the entire Phase 1 program, which well positions Hepion for upcoming Phase 2a clinical trial in NASH patients.\n\nDr. Robert Foster, CEO of Hepion Pharmaceuticals has said that the drug candidate \"CRV431 offers a novel approach to the treatment of fibrosis caused by NASH and possibly other causes of liver injury,\".  He went on to add \"This is because CRV431 acts, in part, by directly targeting fibrotic scar formation by down-regulating an important regulator of collagen synthesis, cyclophilin B, thereby reducing collagen production. This contrasts with most other NASH drug candidates that target events such as dyslipidemia or diabetes that may lead to fibrosis. Combining the direct antifibrotic actions of CRV431 with the indirect actions of other drug candidates likely represents the best opportunity for rapidly and effectively decreasing liver fibrosis in NASH.\"\n\nThe global Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) market is expected to exceed US$20.0 Billion by 2025 growing at a CAGR of more than 10.0% during the period from 2018-2025.  Hepion has a long way to go before approval or commercialization of its drug.  However, with a market cap of just $26 million, even a small chance of developing a successful treatment for such a large prize makes this an interesting stock.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.  Please do your own research.",

Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n2. They already have the X series CPUs for those who want well binned chips / top silicon. \n3. The consumer CPU market for AMD is now showing long term potential as a profit puppy. \n\u2014\u2014\n[https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results](https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results)\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nAMD has a strong potential to beat Q3 expected earnings. Why? Because their production has a solid chance of recovering by then. Why? Because they have a somewhat diversified access to memory, and the raw materials needed for production.\n\n[AMD](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMD/explorer/interest_coverage)\n\nAMD - has had a rough go of it, but it\u2019s starting to recover. Yes In the consumers minds, and it\u2019s starting to show in the numbers as well.\n\nDirectly from the post linked above regarding AMD earnings\n\nQ4 2019 Results\n\n\"Revenue of $2.13 billion was up 50 percent year-over-year primarily driven by the Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue was up 18 percent compared to the prior quarter as a result of higher revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment partially offset by lower revenue in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.\"\n\n^ Clearly this is the direction the company is headed in my opinion.\n\n*What are my price targets?\n\nI fully expect AMD to hit ATH of 70$ per share by Q4 or Q1 2021. Why? Because there is demand. Look at what this stock was in feb 2019 and then look at its peak before Covid. Compare that to its current price. See what I\u2019m getting at here?\n\nHas anyone seen the MU surge? Memory is in high demand. Specially flash NVME and SSDs. \n\nWhat does this mean for AMD?\nAMD is heavily dependent on companies like micron (TSMC, Samsung, etc) GDDR6, flash memory, and VRAM are all dependent on this sector.\n\nThe amount of improvement in the memory sector -is staggering. Flash Memory is finally \u201caffordable\u201d to most mid-range computing customers. At the least - far more improvement here than simply PUMPING more GHz into the same cores and SMT that INTC always does. \n\n\n-----\nTLDR: Everyone already hopped on their **** why does this matter now... so what?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. - I can\u2019t speak to how the current market trends will affect this stock in the very short term. \n\nThis is literally a power play - in my opinion - showing how they can adapt to a changing market and their literally competing with theirselves now (just like NVDA competes with itself on its own high end GPUs)",

I got in at mid march when things were lowest. I am still a bringer but i found that the covid crash plus all the money I had saved up seemed like a good time to start dabbling.\n\nright now i hold: BA- 4 shares NCHL 99 share, Apple 11 share, RCL 40share- got a really good deal on that, it was trading at near $130 and i got in a $45 ERl- 95 share-again thought this was a steal bc i bought in at 40 and it was trading in the $60 C- 16 shares SYY- 15 share\n\nI bought all these back in mid march along with 1.32 BTC\n\nI understand these are risky and. cruisline may not recover anytime soon so this could lose me a lot of money but im in a position in life which i an afford to take huge hit, so i can learn for next time. phase two of my goal is to reap the benefits of his sale I got with all these stocks-assuming they survive, allocating the money i made from them and use it for my real long term portfolio, which includes:\n\n FAANG -Apple, FB,(debating AMZn bc how expensive the price has gotten at this point, -MFST -Mu -AMD- although ive had a love hate relation shit with AMD -V -JNJ''\n\nwhat doe you guy think if my plan/portfolio effectively, Id like to bring the portfolio to list to 10 manageable companies which i can study in the ins and outs of these companies and mitigated the gambling associated with the list of stock I initially chose\n\nThanks or any and all feed back, Im still a science student in the inventive domain having shifted career path from physics and chemistry.\n\nAny help/brutal criticism is welcome!",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been managing my stock portfolio kinda randomly, some options some stocks buying on a whim and selling. I\u2019m bummed that I didn\u2019t hold any stock long term even though I was an early adopter of AMZN, NFLX etc. and being in tech I knew they were going to be big, even NVDA or SHOP couple years ago. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t want to lose the next 10-15 years. I want to invest in a disciplined way, buy around 20 stocks and then add on dips, So I\u2019ll keep around $100K cash. My big confusion is which 20 stocks to pick? I\u2019ve been reading here, checking TipRanks, have Motley fool advisor and the list I come up with is huge. I\u2019m pasting the symbols that have creeped into my planning spreadsheet below. Also I\u2019m confused whether to buy fewer stocks at higher investment or many at lower. Also whether more investment into the stable large names (MSFT, AMZN, AAPL) or more in relatively newer names (SE, DOCU, NET etc.) I\u2019ve searched many posts on the \u201c20 stock portfolio\u201d or such but my confusion will not go away. Hence I\u2019m posting here to hear from you directly. I\u2019m 42 years old, good stable job, will have $50K more to add to the portfolio every year. I\u2019m open to moderate risk. Help me with a 15-20 stock investment portfolio that I can hold long term and add on dips.

        "selftext": "This week we look at a bullish play in my favorite company in Idaho.  No, not ADM Edible Bean Specialties (Ticker: ADM), but the maker of computer memory, Micron (Ticker: MU).  Tried to find a potato joke, but clearly came up short \\[although the first half of one is at the bottom of the post...\\].  A 6 month chart shows that Micron has recovered much of the March COVID-19 drop, but not all: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[6 Month chart of MU](https://preview.redd.it/9stfq91qavb51.png?width=495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=726b49ca5f9d5d9ce574b55a73d550c844d1a348)\n\nFurther, we see that historical volatility has come down significantly, but implied volatility remains a good deal higher (Make sure to look at the absolute value of IV as well).  To take advantage, we look to sell some options, in one of two ways:\n\n* Sell 21 August 42.5 puts for 0.51\n* Sell 21 August 45/42.5 put spreads for 0.40\n* Price is at the midpoint as of 7/17/2020\n* All trades are for educational purposes and do not constitute financial advice.\n\nIf you want to consider MU as a long term holding, selling a cash secured put will get you in close to $42.  As a pure trade, the put spread offers a nice return on risk if the position expires worthless.  19% for a little over a month ($40/$210 = 19%).  \n\nThere are no earnings during this time frame, which is a benefit to this type of trade (we don't want movement).  \n\nOne risk, as with any placed while the world battles COVID-19, is an overall market drop that takes MU with it, much like what occurred in March.  Here are a couple ways you can offset some of this risk:\n\n* Sell a call spread, like the 55/57.5 for 0.36.  This requires MU to stay within the 45-55 range at expiration and one takes in a total of 0.76 (assuming the put spread is selected)\n* Maintain a smaller position size. Put on less spreads than normal to limit the overall risk to your account.\n\nQuestions? Comments? Better potato jokes than this \"What do you call a potato that has turned to the dark side?\" ....",
