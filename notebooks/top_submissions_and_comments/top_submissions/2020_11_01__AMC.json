        "selftext": " \n\nWe all know SPY at ATHs, Dow 30k, PLTR is fucking moving, EV insanity blah blah blah. But I just know there is some bleary eyed idiot from Stocks and Investing here that is like I just CANT bring myself to take these kind of risks, look how expensive the market is!!!\n\nEven though the market is at all time highs, and basically the market has been trading flat other than yesterday, there is crazy volatility underneath the surface. For almost a decade, growth stocks (high top line growth, high multiples, etc) have outperformed value because 1) growth was hard to find as the economy was dog shit 2) interest rates dropped like a stone from 4 down to 1.4% pre-covid which makes cash flows in the out year more valuable today when you discount them back 3) usually high period of disruption due to technology (connectivity, shift to mobile, computing increases, etc). **But basically, when growth is hard to find, you are willing to pay the fuck up for future earnings growth.**\n\nBut boys. Let me tell ya, economic growth is coming the fuck back. One, the Fed goes fucking brrr - and ole Yellen is back in the saddle.1) The Fed is basically a permeant backstop now which basically changes the equation of risk for both investors and companies. 2) The Dems will, and should, print money with reckless abandon. Because the US dollar is the global reserve currency they should print dough until the dollar fucking breaks. And it basically hasn't budged even though the US has spent 7 trilly on Stimulus. 3) Savings rates in both the US and Canada are at all time highs, with interest rates at all time lows. Have you seen the fucking housing market? Not only is there lots of money on the sidelines, **demand is coming online in sync across the globe.** You may never see a demand spike like you are about to see in areas like Leisure / Travel. Hotels in Honolulu aren't going from 150$/night back to $400 next year. Mother fucker they are going to 600. Every live sporting event, concert, festival, restaurant will be fucking PACKED. **4)** The fed changed their inflation policy from 2%, to an average metric - basically meaning they will run the economy hot to bring average inflation up to 2-2.5% over an observed time period. Well inflation has been sub 1.5% for YEARS and they will run this fucker HOT at 5-6% GDP before they touch rates. **Most important thing here is that rates are going up on the ten year, there will be unreal demand for things most affected by the virus, and the relative valuation of low pe stocks is going to start looking reallll good realll fast.**\n\nSo what does this mean? You want to be in early cycle cyclicals right now. Industrials, Materials, Banks. You also wanna be in travel/restaurants. Energy will rock too, but its kind of dog shit and you can leave it be.\n\nCurve ball though - I'm one of those blind ass tech bulls. I'm not here to tell you that GM is better than TSLA, they aren't. But when you can pay 15x for 100% EPS growth from GM you're going to do that instead of paying 300x for the same rate at Tesla. Same thing with software. I jerk off that business model and the trap door isn't going to fall out, its just not going to do fucking well on a relative basis.\n\nI don't wanna sell my tech shit, but I wanna participate in this reopening lunacy. So how do I do it? Buy shit thats going to do well if some government shut the place down. I'm talking DOCU, PTON, ZM, COUP, OKTA, I dunno, whatever software you want. But balance this shit with long dated calls in reopening stuff. If your calls expiry worthless, your tech shit will be up so much you won't care. If tech is flat to down you'll mint on the calls. I control 16x in shares vs my outlay for the calls, basically the size of the rest of my portfolio in Reopening calls June 21-Jan 22. Sharpe ratio (return/vol) for the last two months is 5.2. Psychologically, the lockdown headlines just aren't doing it anymore. LA, NYC, Chicago, France, Germany, Canada, all locked down, market it looking through it. AZN puts out a garbage vaccine release and value is smoking hot. You'll see more catalysts as these places reopen, first innoculations are announced, general availability, etc. AND cases will start to seasonally decline around March when it gets warmer out. And if you don't think this shit is seasonal, you're dumb. You think we just found the magic in July? Shut up.\n\nLong WFH - AMD, PLTR, ZM, PTON, DOCU, SQ\n\nLong Reopening Calls - AMC, XLF, KRE, XLE, LYFT, JETS",

        "selftext": "**Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary!** For those of you that don\u2019t remember me, I am the sick fuck that used to comb through all the DD you idiots post and combine all the relevant information into one post a few times a week. That\u2019s how I got the flair. I took a break but now I\u2019m back and have fewer brain cells than ever! As in previous posts, the ticker will be in bold on the left and I write this so that the info I deem most \u201cimportant\u201d will be near the top. I would ask you to read all the way through to get the most information you can, but honestly I don\u2019t give a shit. As always a follow-up from previous DD summaries (not this time), TLDR, and plays will be at the bottom. I know you cucks are greedy so this info can give you a little more variety instead of only playing with Elons testes all day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CNK**\\- Cinemark is a movie theatre company and before you roll your eyes and scroll on, take a look because it has a lot more potential than you think. Cinemark owns theatres in 42 states and 16 countries totaling over 6,000 screens. Granted they are not being used right now but that is a lot of assets. For being shutdown, they are doing surprisingly well. They have more than enough cash on hand to last many more months and that is if they make no profits at all which is highly unlikely. Even if this were to last longer than their cash, they have very manageable debt and more than enough assets to cover it. The majority of their debt is long-term and most of it isn't even due until 2023 which gives them more than enough time to either roll it over or generate enough capital to pay it down. The positive information above isn\u2019t even taking into account the [deal they just made](https://ir.cinemark.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/478/universal-filmed-entertainment-group-and-cinemark-theaters) with Universal (which includes DreamWorks) to release in their theatres for at least 3 weeks before they can release the movies anywhere else. This is fantastic news because it gives them exclusive access to the opening few weeks of any movie which historically is when they make their most money. \n\nWhat can you take away from this? This is a company that is being managed very well given the circumstances. Long term movie theatres are not going away. They may change but for many people, nothing beats going and seeing something on the big screen. Given the fact that AMC is gasping for air, CNK has the potential to become the leading movie theatre in the nation. To me, shares are the best idea. Long term and at this discount they will net you some good profits. But I know that's not how you fucks work, you want options. The [original poster](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jvxjpu/cinemarks_cnk_free_tendies/) advocated for 20c for 4/21 and 30c for 12/21 which is very reasonable. THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY. For more info take a look at their [10-k](https://ir.cinemark.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001564590-20-005646/0001564590-20-005646.pdf) and previous [earnings](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_529fa8877bd02a78fc90e3d84715e621/cinemark/news/2020-11-05_Cinemark_Holdings_Inc_Reports_Results_for_the_475.pdf). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EBAY-** We all know eBay. A substantial online consumer sales company that has been around for years. What some of you don't know is that they are at 3-month lows GOING INTO BLACK FRIDAY. Are you fucking kidding me? An online store that makes money every Black Friday is down on a year where online shopping is at numbers never seen before in history? Seems like people are confused. Last year they made 2.8 billion in their [4th quarter](https://ebay.q4cdn.com/610426115/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/Exhibit-99.1-ER-eBay-Q4-2019_FINAL.pdf) which includes Black Friday and Christmas. Just last earnings (3rd Quarter 2020) they [reported earnings](https://ebay.q4cdn.com/610426115/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Exhibit-99.1-ER-eBay-Q3-2020_FINAL.pdf) of **2.6 billion**. A quarter without Black Friday and Christmas made almost as much as they did last year doing those times. Using just 9 out of the total of 15 brain cells I have and a little bit of extrapolation, I can say that they are going to crush last year's Q4 numbers. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jwls84/ebay_call_the_safest_option_you_can_get/) has some more information you can take a look there and at the other links to further decide for yourself. OP says 55 or 60c for January 21 which seems like a safe bet, but if you want a shorter-term play, I would say around 49.5-51 for mid to late December would work just as well. This will be closing the holiday shopping season and locking in profits for eBay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HDS-** I'll just pull stuff straight from the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jwk6iq/the_knock_off_home_depot/), \n\n&gt;HD Supply is an industrial distributor in North America. Their revenue is 7.39 billion. Home Depot has decided to acquire it...\n\nAfter news of the acquisition hit the price jumped to 55 from 44. Home Depot plans to acquire them for 56 a share cash. This news, however, disregards the fact that FOUR INDEPENDENT LAW FIRMS for possibly breaching their fiduciary duties or violating the federal securities laws in connection with the company\u2019s acquisition by The Home Depot, Inc. Uh oh, that's not good. If these firms find anything, and they very well could, expect acquisition talks to breakdown completely and the stock price to tank. And guess what, they dropped a bit after market close as well. Watch the news closely because this is quite possibly a slamdunk for puts given how quickly the price rises and falls. The price may hover around 55 for a while given Home Depot but just watch. This could be a nightmare for both companies. Given all that, make sure you do a little of your own research. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Knowledge-** Now back in May, I made [this post explaining how to play earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge06g7/how_to_play_earnings_like_youre_not_a_retard_tldr/) like you were not completely incompetent. There is a lot more that goes into it than just earnings. You also have to understand the psychology of the market which is really fucking difficult. We have all lost a shit ton of money because a company did good on earnings and the market decided it wasn\u2019t good enough. Or they took a shit on earnings but not a huge shit and the market sent it to the moon. I have a bit of experience in this sector knowing quite a bit about mass psychology so if you would like a post similar to the earnings one about market psychology then let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve got for today. Good luck fuckers and, for those of you that remember, instead of doing these summaries 3 times a week I will be doing them after market close on Wednesday and Sunday nights so that you can work through all the big words in your head before market open the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Cinemark has a pretty good chance of pulling out of this a bigger player in the movie industry. eBay is undervalued given their extremely high likelihood of killing earnings and raking in cash because of the holiday season. HD Supply is being investigated and acquisition talks could take a turn for the worst. I know about market psychology, would you like to?\n\n**Plays;** CNK 20c 4/21 or 30c 12/21, EBAY 55-60c 1/21 or 49-51c 12/20, HDS 55p 12/20 1/21 or 3/21 with 3/21 being the safest bet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; Do your own god damn research before going all-in on something I say. I am not telling you this will work, I simply go through posts and do my own research then compile it here. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.",

        "selftext": "AMCX is AMC networks, the media company/ TV channel. You may know them from Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Mad Men.\n\nHow short is short? AMCX has a float of 25 million shares, and short interest of 18 million shares. About 70%. With daily average volume of 1-1.5 million, it would take about 2 weeks for every short to cover. It is one of the most shorted companies on the market, and currently \"hard to borrow,\" indicating it's not cheap to stay short.\n\nWhy is it a value stock? AMCX has a market cap of a billion dollars. AMCX also has cash reserves of... a billion dollars. It has a PE ratio of 10 and a PS ratio of 0.5. In their most recent earnings, they beat. AMCX is a profitable company! \n\nHow is it going to squeeze? One good acquisition rumor should do it. There will be consolidation in the streaming content world, and AMCX would be a good pickup for one of the big names. It just popped above its 200 dMA and is looking relatively strong, so it may be slow-motion squeezing already. The company recently bought back 10 million shares, tightening the float. \n\nIMO, it's not a matter of if, but when.

        "selftext": "Hello my fellow autists,\n\nHow are your *\"the market is going to collapse because of US the election\"* puts treating ya?\n\nAnyway... Today I'm not here to make fun of your poor decisions, I'm here to talk RECOVERY!\n\nI'll jump straight to the point. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, member of the board of Pfizer, went on CNBC and gave us the timeline of the vaccine, so that we can all load up and make some cash.\n\nSome things to understand:\n\n* **There is already a vaccine!** Pfizer made it, they are testing it already on tens of thousands of people before they release to the masses.\n* Trial results will be announced at some point this month. Yes, **November 2020**.\n* Authorization to use the vaccine on older population will come some point this year. That's within the **next two months**.\n* People need to get **2 doses of vaccine**, spaced about **a month apart**.\n* We'll have the **first group** of **immune** fellows from the vaccine around **February/March 2021**.\n* **General population** vaccine **late Q2 2021**, **early Q3 2021**, in time for fall season of 2021.\n\nHere is the exact video if you want to hear it yourself: [https://youtu.be/pq44IBjcd7c?t=101](https://youtu.be/pq44IBjcd7c?t=101)\n\nNow is the time to load up on calls, stocks, sell puts on beaten down sectors that will explode as soon as something about a vaccine hits the news.\n\nAirlines, cruises, tourism, retail, cinemas, oil, you pick. Easy 100% recoveries. Take a look at CCL for example:\n\n* April 2nd - Corona is bad. CCL is at $7.97.\n* June 8th - We realize corona is not that bad. CCL hits $24.91. That's a 212% jump in two months.\n* Today - Corona is bad again. CCL is at $13.55.\n* A few months from now - Corona is not that bad. CCL hits - you tell me!\n\nDo this same exercise with JWN, AMC, XOM, AAL. Get it?\n\nAnd for the love of God, stop wasting money on puts.

        "selftext": "This is some small street bets exclusive DD, since I was banned from WSB for not having big enough losses I thought Id share some of my epic analysis on AMC Theaters for earnings.\n\nNow obviously, we all know they will report a massive loss. This is already priced into the stock and analysts are expecting a -4.95 eps this is a greater expected loss than the expected eps from q2. Now looking at most companies in the entertainment sector and most companies in general q2 was the worst quarter. Why do analysts expect q3 to be even worse? I have no idea. I believe they will have a loss of -2.80 to -4.00 eps for q3. Why exactly? Well they big movie release Tenet should've generated at least some income even though it was a considered quite a fail. But even bigger than that, their partnership with Universal in which they collect some of the money earned in digital releases after it is shown in theaters should show some effect into their q3 results. \n\nLastly using google trends, we can see there was an increase in terms like \"movie theater\" , \"movie times\".  Yes these increases are very small and nothing compared to the pre corona search volume but and increase nonetheless meaning they shouldn't be reporting the massive loss that's even worse than q2 that analysts expect. \n\nGoogle trends:  https://imgur.com/ycVScCW \n\nas you can see there was a little increase from the april may range to the q3 range. In q2 the intrest was as low as 6 and now the search intrest is in 15-20 range. \n\nAll in all, this is still nothing but a very risky high reward high loss play. \n\nMy current play is selling the 2 put 11/6 for .20 and buying some lotto call debit spreads. Buying the 2 and selling the 2.5 for 11/6 24 dollar premium cost and a potential $26 gain. I think it crossing 2.5 is more likely than not. Also this is forgetting to mention the retard strength this stock will have on any sign of positive or hopeful news. Anyways GL!",

        "selftext": "So I\u2019m starting to build my thesis and ideas to set positions for 2021. It\u2019s looking like 2021 will be a recovery year and a step into normalcy. What are some stocks that are solid companies with upside to get to where they were pre March 2020? Here\u2019s my list so far.\n\nLUV and SAVE - I think 2021 will be a recovery for travel but mostly domestic. Both of these companies have cash on hand and can operate closer to capacity with domestic. I like them to recover quicker than other airlines LUV still has about $19 upside to get back to pre covid levels and SAVE about $40ish\n\nBUD - I think clubs, events, parties will slowly step in the direction along with restaurants. People will consumer more alcohol This is still about $32 pre covid upside. \n\nSIX - Theme parks opening up again. Sea World and Disney already kind of priced in, although I think Disney will continue to grow. Six Flags still have about $30 from pre covid level upside. \n\nJWN - Although Nordstrom popped today, you still have $15 upside for a solid brand. \n\nDDS - Same as Nordstrom. Dillards has a good following and $30 upside. I think Nordstrom has a better online presence though. \n\nAMC - Risky play here as they don\u2019t have a good balance sheet, but $3 and potentially more upside long term. \n\nCNK - From my understanding, Cinemark has a better balance sheet than AMC and still has about $13 upside. I\u2019m thinking of selling AMC and jumping in this. \n\nJust about all Bank Stocks. All banks are still down good but. The ones I like the most are C, JPM, and BAP. \n\nWhat are some I\u2019m missing? Any ideas are greatly appreciated for me to research. Think entertainment, products, events, travel, consumables etc.",

So the amount of tent pole movies have now doubled for them next year. \n\nTo me, it seems like a unique advantage that only the theater industry has when it comes to these recovery stocks. Someone that has to reschedule a vacation in 2020 won't then book two vacations in 2021. But people who want to see Black Widow, will see it 2021 as well as another movie like Suicide Squad. \n\nIdk, I could be looking into things too much. And they pretty much need Wonder Woman 1984 to keep its Christmas release date, but just something I thought was interesting and unique to theaters. AMC stock ran up to about $7 when Tenet released, so it seems like the idea of a bunch of huge block busters coming out in 2021 would drive the stock up.",

Hope you enjoy it.\n\n# TL;DR and Positions:\n\n**This is a reasonably short-term bet that WYNN, which rose over 25% on vaccine news, is overextended and will pull back.**\n\n* Dec 18 \u201920 $75p and 85p\n* Jan 15 \u201921 $80p and $90p\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vt2w0cvda6061.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f13f6b240e8e72e55cce658080a23f21552763c9\n\n# Thesis, for anyone interested:\n\nThis is partially a play on vaccine exuberance (targeting cyclical/reopening names), and partially a play on Wynn specifically\n\n***Vaccine Exuberance***\n\n* As everyone knows, Pfizer and Moderna have recently reported stellar efficacy data on their COVID-19 vaccines. Last week\u2019s Pfizer vaccine pump, in particular, sent cyclical names (i.e. cruise lines, airlines, casinos, AMC, etc.) soaring.\n* IMO, these names went too far ahead of themselves. It\u2019s true that the strong data is a triumph for science and signals that there\u2019s a light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel. However, once the euphoria dissipates, we have to confront a basic truth-: the vaccine isn\u2019t going to be widely available until sometime in 2Q 2021, possibly later.\n* For context, PFE and MRNA will apply for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), with an FDA decision expected sometime in December. But even if the FDA issues EUA, the limited doses of vaccines that are currently available will only be provided to very select populations, e.g. high-risk populations. Full approval (not EUA) for the vaccines are expected in 1Q 2021, meaning most people will not be getting vaxxed until next year.\n* This means that in the short term, nothing about the cyclical names has fundamentally changed. Their businesses will continue to struggle, especially with the looming threat of additional stay-at-home orders. Further, those who have watched the market this year know that every subsequent vaccine news generally provides diminishing pumps (unless it's something new altogether, like the Pfizer/Moderna efficacy data). **I believe that the recent pump in the cyclicals was built on euphoria that will fade in the coming weeks.**\n\n***Wynn***\n\n* Disclaimer: if you think the thesis above makes sense, **you might also consider playing names like CCL and AMC**. I personally chose WYNN for a couple of reasons-:\n* The stock has been hovering in the $70-75 range for a while (since April 8, it has closed below $70 only thrice). I consider the recent runup to $100+ way too much given that no material news was released by the company specifically.\n* Nevada is having a hard time with covid right now. On Nov 10 Governor Sisolak advised citizens to stay at home for 2 weeks, giving them the [ultimatum](https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/sisolak-gives-nevada-2-weeks-to-get-virus-under-control/) that if things don\u2019t get better, \u201cI will be forced to take action in 14 days,\u201d he said, although he mentioned that \u201cI don\u2019t want to take enforcement. I want to lift restrictions.\u201d\n* Yet the [usual facts abound:](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/nevada-coronavirus-cases.html) cases are at an all time high and continue to grow, while hospitalizations are rising as well. I expect that this trend continues post Thanksgiving.\n* Clearly shutdowns and business restrictions are unpopular, but the [latest news](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/sisolak-restrictions-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19-coming-very-soon-2186014/) is that Sisolak might take some sort of action soon. **Any talk (or action, of course) of shutting casinos down may send Wynn spiraling back down.**\n* (Sidenote: Puts on LVS, CZR, MGM seem viable too, but Wynn has run up the most)\n\n***Several Counterarguments/Things That Can Derail This Trade***\n\n* It is unclear that casinos will close down again. From the [same article](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/sisolak-restrictions-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19-coming-very-soon-2186014/): \u201cin responding to other questions about potentially keeping casinos open, the governor said he doesn\u2019t want to \u201cshut down all of the economy if we can avoid it.\u201d\n* In fact, Sisolak has [encouraged tourists to continue coming to Nevada](https://news3lv.com/news/local/tourists-welcome-in-nevada-locals-asked-to-stay-home-for-two-weeks). There is pressure to keep businesses open, so he may not bend the knee for shutdowns.\n* Additional good vaccine news (particularly an EUA approval) might send all the cyclical names rocketing up again, and Wynn would be no exception.\n* J Pow turns on the money printer and massacres all puts.\n\n***Positions***\n\n* I\u2019m thinking that a stream of bad news will overshadow the good news in the next few weeks. That said, December puts are a little risky because the timing will probably coincide with further good vaccine news, so slightly smaller positions here. The bulk of the position is in Jan puts as you can tell.\n* For strikes, I just chose a few that make sense to me, along with a speculative $75p. I reinforce once again, with some exceptions, Wynn does not stay below $70 for long, so if the stock does drop bigly, I will be cashing out before it teases low $70's.\n\nLet me know what y'all think",

Last night was the earnings call, and it was nothing but bad news. Between the increased costs, low revenues, and dependency on the idea that things will change for the better, it has no chance of recovering any time soon. The prospect of another US shutdown, as well as the current EU shutdown are going to completely strangle AMC to death.\n\nIf you are holding AMC and looking to save any tendies, you should get out now while the stock is artificially inflated and before the likely big sell off later this week. Don't get caught with your pants down on this one.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe bigest, gayest bear",

        "selftext": "I suppose based on vaccine anticipations and the news that Wonderwoman 1984 will not be HBO Max exclusive, but also released theatrically. AMC is also surging today, no doubt for the same reasons. Will either maintain or will it just be another temporary bounce on their bumpy road?\n\nThe fact that they are sharing a release with HBO Max and that audiences may not be all that interested in the film itself, however well its predecessor failed, all seem like strong caveats. On the other hand, there is certainly going to be a strong segment of hardcore fans that will no doubt watch the film however they can and also a segment of people who have probably been chomping at the bits to get back to theaters. Whether or not these groups crossover sufficiently is one of the big questions, in my opinion. And while Wonderwoman was a hit, it was no Avengers: Infinity War, i.e., a mega-event which united and galvanized franchise fans.\n\nI would have more confidence if I saw stronger marketing for the film and of course, if hope wasn't resting on a single movie. What gives me hope is the fact that people take dates to movies and Wonderwoman is, in many ways, a perfect \"compromise movie\" for many couples; it features action and superheroes, which would attract many men, and romance and themes of female empowerment which could bring in women (to speak in generalities).",

I'm a little salty that I spent a ton of time researching and typing a full-up DD for CNK last Thursday and Friday.  I got lazy and left early friday, figuring I'd finish today... Now it's irrelevant.  Even you, yeah you, with the smooth brain, can see that CNK is up bigly today.  **But you have not missed the boat yet!**\n\nI dare say the words short squeeze, but hear me out.  I know everyone is sick of hearing it after the GME thing still hasn't panned out, but CNK is 30% shorted, and most of them have gotten in since the BK news from AMC.  **CNK IS NOT AMC**.  Thats I'll I need to say about that.  Back to the numbers:\n\nShort interest has been increasing since the end of April, when there was roughly 11m shorted.  We've now increased to 30M shares short, as of last month.  Using data from marketbea, the average share price shorted at from Apr until now is 12.40--that's completely unweighted for number of shares shorted, just a pure average for a stake in the ground.  More importantly, from 15 September to 15 October, shares shorted went from 23-29 M, at a weighted average of $8.87 per share.  [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CNK/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CNK/short-interest/)\n\nCool.  Now lets look at the shareholders.  Institutional investors own 85% of the float, according to CNN money.  **The top 10 institutional owners** and fund managers own 67% of the company (79M shares), or --get this-- **89.3% of the float!** \n\nWith 30 M shares (33% of the float) shorted as of last count, this has the potential to really explode.  \n\nPos: long 2k shares.  Had planned on jumping in on some sweet Mar '21 calls, but missed the boat.  Buy shares, ride it up to 20+ and then do what you wish.  CNK will be back to 30+ by EOY 21 as long as the divvy is reinstated.",

        "selftext": "Think I\u2019ll have any luck in the finance world?\n\nThroughout the pandemic, I have made really good trades, and also some very poor ones. Most of my losses have been due to emotional trading rather than being wrong. Currently down about 6.8K for the entire year. My dad started investing in webull when the market was literally at bottom and scooped up BBBY, AMC, MRNA, NVAX and a bunch of other tickers that went ballistic. In total my old man went from about 4K to 10K from March to now. Along the way I advised him to buy JWN at 12.55 in September, PLAY at 12.50 in July, and a penny stock called DFFN at .60 in may which I begged him to sell at 1.50 and thankfully he listened, now it\u2019s down to .67. In total, the plays that I have given him throughout the year netted him at least $1,400. Told him to sell half of JWN before earnings in case they shat the bed, but they pulled the rabbit out the hat as y\u2019all saw yesterday and this morning. The latest thing I told him to buy was $720 worth of a certain SPAC that is banned on this forum now at 11.20 with the funds he gained from selling half of his JWN at 24.49. I know why my dad is making money and I\u2019m not, because he\u2019s not looking at the plays I give him every 5 seconds like I do. \n\nDo you guys think I would be a shit investment banker, or perhaps produce similar results like I have with my dad\u2019s portfolio. Forced myself to give up trading for the time being to guard myself from further losses. Gave him full access to my trading account so he can withdraw for me. Still got 1.5K liquid waiting to be settled to cash out and more paychecks coming in. So I\u2019ll be okay. But damn losing sucks. Have to keep telling myself that I literally can\u2019t win bc of my emotional trading patterns.",

        "selftext": "My portfolio will consist about 10-15% of Realty Income Corporation. It should be closer to that 10% mark, since I\u2019m young and able to take risks. In order to invest in this REIT company I\u2019ve done research. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found out so far. Youc can look these things up very easily, but decided to put some of them here.\n\n- It\u2019s real estate portfolio is well exposed to many industries. Mostly in convenience stores and drug stores. They have about 600 tenants\n \n- They are also exposed to the UK, which is nice. It indicates that they are activeky trying to grow their area of influence outside the US.\n\n- Their net debt is about 27% of their enterprise value, which I think is fine. They aren\u2019t too badly on debt.\n\n- They have a VERY solid dividend. They are one of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s dividend aristocrats. They were able to keep a steady dividend and annual growth during 2007-2009, which were of course very hard years in the stock market. They pay a MONTHLY dividend, which I think many of us know already.\n\n- Their theaters are doing a bit badly, since all of their tenants aren\u2019t paying their rent. I think this happened a few months ago. 51% of their theaters are closed. If AMC goes bankrupt, this will take a hit under their belt.\n\n- They have a strategy, which works in the long-term. I think yous should be in it for the long term.\n\nIn short, this is a long-term, conservative and well diversed REIT company with good dividends.\n\nPlease add more to this list.

Some of these have gapped up immensely already, but could make for some good momentum plays or scalps throughout the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Some of these still have large gaps to fill, be prepared for a correction.](https://preview.redd.it/8qn5gkdem7y51.png?width=1609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1828d7e78ad2ddb2adbcb475a8a2a0cd7ec7fd2)\n\n***$APVO:***\n\nPre-market gapper this morning, going from $22 to a high of $82.84 before selling off to the current price of $46. Will be watching this stock for volume/momentum plays today.\n\nAptevo Therapeutics Inc.  almost tripled to  $68.24  in premarket trading Monday after the company said it saw positive results in its ongoing APVO436 Phase 1 clinical trial.\n\nThe biotechnology company's APVO436 is an anti-CD123 x anti-CD3 targeted investigational bispecific antibody therapy being evaluated for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome in a Phase 1/1b dose- escalation study evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic profile. Aptevo said it received preliminary data that indicated complete remission in a second patient, in addition to the one previously announced. In total, there are now two patients with clinical remission in cohort 6.\n\nThe company said the data received also showed one patient exhibiting stable disease status, and six patients where the disease had progressed. A total of nine patients were listed in cohort 6 of the clinical trial.  Aptevo Therapeutics  said the second patient with complete remission showed bone marrow blasts of 33% at screen, then exhibited a rise in blasts to 46% after the first cycle of treatment. Subsequently, the bone marrow blasts dropped to 8% after the second cycle, and to 4% after the fourth cycle of treatment. The patient's platelet count and absolute neutrophil count met complete remission criteria.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Not a pennystock, but insane price action this morning.](https://preview.redd.it/injtl7vgm7y51.png?width=1615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03b34672a882d72155857178a4926e7d6468081b)\n\n**Never forget to do your own DD; remember: For all you know, all the stocks that I mention here will dip 90% tomorrow; Do your own DD, I'm not some magic fairy.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone and Welcome I am going to talk about the impact of the announced vaccine on the stock market and what is happening to tech companies as well as the recovery plays [BANNER](https://ibb.co/TYKs2FB)\n\nYesterday there was a lot of movement in the stock market as companies that benefited a lot from the stay and work from home environment saw a huge drop with gaming companies like EA or Take Two interactive tumbling as well as Peloton and Zoom who fell more than 15% while even the biggest companies like Amazon felt the shift being down more than 5% [NEWS](https://ibb.co/72kPtK3) [NEWS](https://ibb.co/GQY3p1t)\n\nMeanwhile any stock that included in person participation like airline and travel stocks saw a huge spike in price, as they finally have some end point of the pandemic in sight with some big gains from companies like AMC, Cinemark, Carnival  [MOVEMENTS](https://ibb.co/HzfLkQM)\n\nWhile Starbucks also made a new all time high as the company will benefit a lot from the reopening as well as improved Us-China relationship. [STARBUCKS](https://ibb.co/j9CW5Z4)\n\nOther companies that saw a big drop yesterday were Bed Bath &amp;Beyond, Chewy, Domino\u2019s &amp; Papa John\u2019s and many more. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/51Rfx9N)\n\nHere are more market movers from yesterday in different sectors  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/WpT1Frx)\n\nWith huge gains being made in the financial sectors with most banks soaring while credit card companies also joined the rally [NEWS](https://ibb.co/nkCD15q) [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0Z2hzv6)\n\nThe announcement made yesterday will also impact the eventual stimulus bill size, as it is likely the bill will be smaller with a more limited time horizon, but this stimulus is still needed as a bridge between now and the time the benefits of the vaccine as lots of businesses still are under a lot of pressure.  [STIMULUS UPDATE](https://ibb.co/mRsgpK1)\n\nWe will also have to wait and see other companies finishing vaccines as the Pfizer one is very hard to deliver from a logistics standpoint it needs to be kept at very low temperatures well below freezing. [LOGISTICS PROBLEM](https://ibb.co/fvVFKyc)\n\nFortunately treatments of the illness are also progressing with Eli Lilly getting emergency use authorization for a new treatment [Eli Lilly NEWS](https://ibb.co/9HwPPsH)\n\nSo yesterday there was a lot of movement in the stocks as more than 70% were advancing with a 96% of new highs vs lows and the volume was up but in this case it was massive with more than 70% percent of companies having above average volume, this lead to a lot of brokers having issues handling the stocks. [CHART](https://ibb.co/x2dTdMc)\n\nThe Dow was the biggest gainer up almost 3% with intraday gains of more than 5% at one point [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/TTb7kdR) , The Nasdaq had a wild ride being up and down but eventually finishing the day down more than 1,5%[NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/N2KNBCV)  and the S&amp;P making new highs but eventually dropping back finishing the day just over 1% up [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/HdfLtq2)\n\nThe biggest gainers came from the energy and financial sectors yesterday with tech and comms suffering the most while small cap and value plays outperformed the market [SIZE CHART](https://ibb.co/zQ1r1bf) with the volatility index not moving to much as I expect this to remain at this level for the next months until we get some more updates on vaccines, stimulus debates and finally with the next president taking over. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/BGfLKLs)\n\nHere is the heat map for yesterday as you can see the market was pretty split with the tech and stay at home names being punished while the recovery plays were up big.  [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/MDMbDFp)\n\nWhile pre-market has started and the tech heavy Nasdaq is being punished again while the Dow is barely up. [PRE-MARKET](https://ibb.co/zPLMRt2)\n\nToday Microsoft will launch the new xBox series X and S just before the biggest competitor for the xBox is due to unveil the new PlayStation5, this is a growing part of Microsoft business and i really like they\u2019re products for gaming despite the PS being more popular. [xBox](https://ibb.co/dMd9JcC)\n\nApple is expected to announce the new Macs, this is expected to present a more than 15 billion dollars opportunity for Apple [NEWS](https://ibb.co/kgK5bMK). Also the company will start taking orders at the end of this week in more than 50 countries [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hYTsn4p), I believe this is a great opportunity to buy the stock at a lower price with this drop in tech companies. They are my favorite company to own as they are expanding the company vertically and are releasing great new subscriptions based services while also benefiting from the cycle of moving phones to 5G.\n\nThe watchdogs seem to be going after big tech as Amazon has been hit with a couple of bad news in the last couple of days, as the vaccine coming out will likely slow the growth of the company beyond 2021, another news came today as the European Union will announce antitrust charges against them, i don\u2019t see this as a big problem for the company as the charges are not very solid.[AMAZON NEWS](https://ibb.co/M25SZ6q)  So I still believe in the company and i will wait for the markets to calm down after the recent drop in stay at home plays to add to my position to the company. Likewise google is being investigated in India for potentially squeezing out competitor in payment processing with Google Pay. [GOOGLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/Jv6h4Lh)\n\nToday Disney also announced that they will cut even more into the employed staff, but they will strongly come back late next year, they are one of my favorite companies as i really like the expansion to the streaming business with Disney+ and Hulu. [DISNEY NEWS](https://ibb.co/vd90pJ4)\n\nSo Beyond Meat has been up and down in the last 36hours as the company was down big after McDonalds announced a new plant based product that didn\u2019t include the company [NEWS](https://ibb.co/gJsvQyd) , afterwards the company jumped back up to positive [NEWS](https://ibb.co/DVj49S6) before eventually finishing the day down huge after they announced a huge miss on estimates, as the gross profit margin fell 6% since a year ago [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/gzPbxMY), while the EBITDA result was a loss of over 4 million dollars versus a more than 13 million profit expected [BYND EPS](https://ibb.co/tPn21Fp). This was followed but another set of news that they will partner with Pizza Hut to offer a plant-based pizza so a huge roller coaster for Beyond Meat. [PIZZA NEWS](https://ibb.co/WzQ6MbW)\n\nMeanwhile McDonalds beat earnings expectations and outlined a new growth strategy while also improving the taste and delivery of its burgers [MCD NEWS](https://ibb.co/j3hC5x2). They beat the EPS handily and also beat on revenue expectations with a big operating margin as the company did very well with its drive thru business [MCD EPS](https://ibb.co/8rgJJhV)\n\nA couple of other news are that one of my favorite companies in the communications sector, T-Mobile announced the expansion of home internet in more than 100 markets. [T-MOBILE](https://ibb.co/tx575z4)\n\nWhile the FAA is expected to end the 737 MAX grounding next week, which combined with the vaccine news will be a great return for Boeing. [BOEING NEWS](https://ibb.co/pPCWbcB)\n\nSo be aware and stay sharp when trading, despite infections rising in more than 60 countries with the US leading the pack in both cases and death and with new records and the highest moving average since march, I believe this will be a great time to own stocks as the political landscape is the most favorable one, [GLOBAL STATS](https://ibb.co/NTYDShp) [US DAILY STATS](https://ibb.co/0tHtRDf)\n\nWith investors being encouraged after the elections, with a split congress and a democratic president the average returns are the best in the last 100 years. [AVG RETURNS](https://ibb.co/rHSqKV8) [INVESTORS SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/qd5Rwc7)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "Hey everyone and Welcome I am going to talk about the impact of the announced vaccine on the stock market and what is happening to tech companies as well as the recovery plays [BANNER](https://ibb.co/TYKs2FB)\n\nYesterday there was a lot of movement in the stock market as companies that benefited a lot from the stay and work from home environment saw a huge drop with gaming companies like EA or Take Two interactive tumbling as well as Peloton and Zoom who fell more than 15% while even the biggest companies like Amazon felt the shift being down more than 5% [NEWS](https://ibb.co/72kPtK3) [NEWS](https://ibb.co/GQY3p1t)\n\nMeanwhile any stock that included in person participation like airline and travel stocks saw a huge spike in price, as they finally have some end point of the pandemic in sight with some big gains from companies like AMC, Cinemark, Carnival  [MOVEMENTS](https://ibb.co/HzfLkQM)\n\nWhile Starbucks also made a new all time high as the company will benefit a lot from the reopening as well as improved Us-China relationship. [STARBUCKS](https://ibb.co/j9CW5Z4)\n\nOther companies that saw a big drop yesterday were Bed Bath &amp;Beyond, Chewy, Domino\u2019s &amp; Papa John\u2019s and many more. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/51Rfx9N)\n\nHere are more market movers from yesterday in different sectors  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/WpT1Frx)\n\nWith huge gains being made in the financial sectors with most banks soaring while credit card companies also joined the rally [NEWS](https://ibb.co/nkCD15q) [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0Z2hzv6)\n\nThe announcement made yesterday will also impact the eventual stimulus bill size, as it is likely the bill will be smaller with a more limited time horizon, but this stimulus is still needed as a bridge between now and the time the benefits of the vaccine as lots of businesses still are under a lot of pressure.  [STIMULUS UPDATE](https://ibb.co/mRsgpK1)\n\nWe will also have to wait and see other companies finishing vaccines as the Pfizer one is very hard to deliver from a logistics standpoint it needs to be kept at very low temperatures well below freezing. [LOGISTICS PROBLEM](https://ibb.co/fvVFKyc)\n\nFortunately treatments of the illness are also progressing with Eli Lilly getting emergency use authorization for a new treatment [Eli Lilly NEWS](https://ibb.co/9HwPPsH)\n\nSo yesterday there was a lot of movement in the stocks as more than 70% were advancing with a 96% of new highs vs lows and the volume was up but in this case it was massive with more than 70% percent of companies having above average volume, this lead to a lot of brokers having issues handling the stocks. [CHART](https://ibb.co/x2dTdMc)\n\nThe Dow was the biggest gainer up almost 3% with intraday gains of more than 5% at one point [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/TTb7kdR) , The Nasdaq had a wild ride being up and down but eventually finishing the day down more than 1,5%[NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/N2KNBCV)  and the S&amp;P making new highs but eventually dropping back finishing the day just over 1% up [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/HdfLtq2)\n\nThe biggest gainers came from the energy and financial sectors yesterday with tech and comms suffering the most while small cap and value plays outperformed the market [SIZE CHART](https://ibb.co/zQ1r1bf) with the volatility index not moving to much as I expect this to remain at this level for the next months until we get some more updates on vaccines, stimulus debates and finally with the next president taking over. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/BGfLKLs)\n\nHere is the heat map for yesterday as you can see the market was pretty split with the tech and stay at home names being punished while the recovery plays were up big.  [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/MDMbDFp)\n\nWhile pre-market has started and the tech heavy Nasdaq is being punished again while the Dow is barely up. [PRE-MARKET](https://ibb.co/zPLMRt2)\n\nToday Microsoft will launch the new xBox series X and S just before the biggest competitor for the xBox is due to unveil the new PlayStation5, this is a growing part of Microsoft business and i really like they\u2019re products for gaming despite the PS being more popular. [xBox](https://ibb.co/dMd9JcC)\n\nApple is expected to announce the new Macs, this is expected to present a more than 15 billion dollars opportunity for Apple [NEWS](https://ibb.co/kgK5bMK). Also the company will start taking orders at the end of this week in more than 50 countries [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hYTsn4p), I believe this is a great opportunity to buy the stock at a lower price with this drop in tech companies. They are my favorite company to own as they are expanding the company vertically and are releasing great new subscriptions based services while also benefiting from the cycle of moving phones to 5G.\n\nThe watchdogs seem to be going after big tech as Amazon has been hit with a couple of bad news in the last couple of days, as the vaccine coming out will likely slow the growth of the company beyond 2021, another news came today as the European Union will announce antitrust charges against them, i don\u2019t see this as a big problem for the company as the charges are not very solid.[AMAZON NEWS](https://ibb.co/M25SZ6q)  So I still believe in the company and i will wait for the markets to calm down after the recent drop in stay at home plays to add to my position to the company. Likewise google is being investigated in India for potentially squeezing out competitor in payment processing with Google Pay. [GOOGLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/Jv6h4Lh)\n\nToday Disney also announced that they will cut even more into the employed staff, but they will strongly come back late next year, they are one of my favorite companies as i really like the expansion to the streaming business with Disney+ and Hulu. [DISNEY NEWS](https://ibb.co/vd90pJ4)\n\nSo Beyond Meat has been up and down in the last 36hours as the company was down big after McDonalds announced a new plant based product that didn\u2019t include the company [NEWS](https://ibb.co/gJsvQyd) , afterwards the company jumped back up to positive [NEWS](https://ibb.co/DVj49S6) before eventually finishing the day down huge after they announced a huge miss on estimates, as the gross profit margin fell 6% since a year ago [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/gzPbxMY), while the EBITDA result was a loss of over 4 million dollars versus a more than 13 million profit expected [BYND EPS](https://ibb.co/tPn21Fp). This was followed but another set of news that they will partner with Pizza Hut to offer a plant-based pizza so a huge roller coaster for Beyond Meat. [PIZZA NEWS](https://ibb.co/WzQ6MbW)\n\nMeanwhile McDonalds beat earnings expectations and outlined a new growth strategy while also improving the taste and delivery of its burgers [MCD NEWS](https://ibb.co/j3hC5x2). They beat the EPS handily and also beat on revenue expectations with a big operating margin as the company did very well with its drive thru business [MCD EPS](https://ibb.co/8rgJJhV)\n\nA couple of other news are that one of my favorite companies in the communications sector, T-Mobile announced the expansion of home internet in more than 100 markets. [T-MOBILE](https://ibb.co/tx575z4)\n\nWhile the FAA is expected to end the 737 MAX grounding next week, which combined with the vaccine news will be a great return for Boeing. [BOEING NEWS](https://ibb.co/pPCWbcB)\n\nSo be aware and stay sharp when trading, despite infections rising in more than 60 countries with the US leading the pack in both cases and death and with new records and the highest moving average since march, I believe this will be a great time to own stocks as the political landscape is the most favorable one, [GLOBAL STATS](https://ibb.co/NTYDShp) [US DAILY STATS](https://ibb.co/0tHtRDf)\n\nWith investors being encouraged after the elections, with a split congress and a democratic president the average returns are the best in the last 100 years. [AVG RETURNS](https://ibb.co/rHSqKV8) [INVESTORS SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/qd5Rwc7)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!
