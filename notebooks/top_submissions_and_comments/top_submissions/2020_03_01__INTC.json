        "selftext": "A little bit of background on Oregon, where the Intel Headquarters is located and 40% of their overall Fabrication sites are located.:\n\n* Oregon can currently test about 80 people a day.  Basically, we have no idea how many people are sick in the state.  But there has been multiple community spread cases and we have a elderly care facility overrun with the shit.  My guess is Oregon is \\~6 days behind Seattle, WA.\n* Oregon is sandwiched between Seattle, WA (north) and a 3.5 hour drive. And SFO, CA (south) a 2 hour flight.  Both of which are heavily infected with Corona Lung AIDS.\n* Oregon case numbers are rising.\n\nIntel and Corona Lung Aids\n\n* Headquarters in Oregon\n* Has their own damn jet that flys back and forth to SFO every day.  \n* Has a shit ton of people that fly back and forth to Seattle, Washington to meet up with partners (Microsoft) every day.\n* Before CLA (Corona Lung AIDS) Intel was having problems meeting their production goals due to 10nm ramp up issues for their processors. \n   * Basically, to dumb it down, your computer goes 'beep beep' because of Intel.  They were having problems getting the Beep Beep to your Autism machine.\n* Intel has 14 Active Fab sites.  Where the Beep beeps are made.\n   * 6 are in Oregon (About to hit the 'boom' for CLA)\n   * 5 more are spread across the southern USA.\n   * 1 in Ireland (shit show of CLA, Connor Mcgreggor's Aunt died for christ's sake!)\n   * 1 is in China (strangely, the safest one?)\n   * 2 are in Israel.  The place that was last to fall in World War Z\n\nCan you read the writing on the wall?\n\nFabs need humans to make the beep beep roll out.  Intel is already having problems meeting demand.  And we all know that AMD makes better Beep boops and doesn't have so much exposure to Corona Lung Aids since their production is handled in Taiwan, where they take sickness serious, not like Oregon rednecks.\n\nTL;DR :  Puts on Intel for Mid April all the way through to 2021.  Price target - who the fuck knows?  But definitely lower then their biggest low - so you autistic punks will probably go way OTM.    What makes this shit even better is that people are thinking Intel is a super safe play because they have good debt ratios and shit.  So the options are still cheap, cause what could possibly hurt them?  Well, what if something shut down 50% of their Beep Beep production capapbility?",

        "selftext": "so sbux offered all partners the option to stay at home for 30 days and get paid. I opted for it so I can play the market :)\n\nANYWAYS\n\nSo my store is a DT store and I decided to go in today to pick up my tip money from last week. This is what I found out....\n\n* 1) Out of 25 partners, 3 of us took the month option\n* ---a partner who works once a week\n* ---a 18yr old partner who lives with parents\n* ---an autistic degenerate who wants to day-trade for the next 30 days\n\n* 2) My store usually does 875-950 customers per day. Currently they are doing 650 customers on avg.\n\n* 3) My store usually makes on avg $5300 per day. Currently they are avg about $4500 a day.\n\n* Sbux insensitized (sp?) anyone who opted to work will get a temp $3/hr and Overtime is approved. \n\n* Sbux also recently announced, if you are working, you get 1 additional partner mark out on food and on drinks per work day. Also any partners not working are entitled to also get 1 partner markout on food or drink during their days off. After that there is a 50% discount on any other purchases, an increase from 20% previously. \n\n* Sbux also has a dedicated Covid-19 CUP Fund. Cup Fund is usually reserved for emergency and u need some money. I dont know what the max is on normal times. But they have allocated $500 per partner for the Covid-19. Reading the form, it seems almost anything will be approved for this special cup fund and I am sure many partners will be taking advantage of a free $500 no strings attached.\n\nDo what you will with that Info.",

        "selftext": "Assume for a moment that recent technological advancements in cloud, AI, automation, etc has created a lot of excitement about the future and it wasn't just a bubble and rather good ol' exuberance, maybe a little excessive but not dangerously so.   Also, don't forget the Donald's  deregulation.   Yeah it's dangerous and stupid for the planet, but \\*\\*\\*\\* me, it really lets the capitalism roar loudly.    Tragedy of the commons can take awhile to bite you in the ass, especially at a global scale.\n\nOk, so the virus comes along and says \"look, any business that relies on human contact is totally \\*\\*\\*\\*ed.\"   So bang, market comes crashing down, because there are a lot of tickers in the S&amp;P that do rely on human contact.  You know, gaming / retail / restaurants -  MGM, WYNN, DRI, ULTA, HD, and yeah maybe even the health ones, but they have always been in a precarious spot - LNC, UHS, UNM.   DIS too got hit, but something tells me they will weather this.   They're more than just a bunch of resorts.\n\nBut those aside, really, if we assume the market was not really in a bubble before but merely a reflection of a society becoming wealthier due to tech and money was more free to do its thing.  Also, we see approval numbers come out that show Donald is actually pretty popular with his handling of the virus.\n\nWhy shouldn't the market take off like a rocket?  Yeah, those tickers above I think are still \\*\\*\\*\\*ed, but everything else should do OK.   Besides, they were stupid businesses anyway and did very little for over all social productivity.  They were just mostly expensive, time consuming entertainment and social waste- what does that really do anyways? \n\nWe may have to restructure our economy so that we're all more efficient in how we become entertained, but this actually may be a good thing, and reason to be optimistic about the future.\n\nI'm talking MSFT, AMZN, GOOG(L), AAPL, NFLX, INTC, T, VZ, NVDA, NFLX, ADBE,  etc.  XLK is a reasonable tracker here.\n\nI'm not saying buy calls, I'm just saying that the reports of death may have been exaggerated and Social distancing is not necessarily a bad thing.   Lots of very very productive people work and learn from home.\n\nAnd then, of course let's not forget - the money machines go BRRRR \\* 10\\^infinity.",

        "selftext": "Hi.  I'm new here.  But I've come to remind you of something that deep inside you knew already but that you might have forgotten in your rush to buy puts with every last penny because, hell, even Kermit the Frog seemed convinced.\n\nYou don't know what the end game here is with this virus, and neither do I.  Virtually no one does. Out of all the people in the world, some might know a little bit more than others do, but guess what?  *You're not fucking one of them.*  You know why?  Because if you were, you wouldn't be spending your Friday reading an Internet post by some random fucktard on an Internet forum subscribed to by 1 million people whose favorite phrases are \"YOLO\" and \"printer go brrrrr\" and who upvote people making (or at least claiming to make; you don't really know, do you?) [extremely brainless decisions](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpo4y5/brothers_the_time_has_come_for_the_ultimate_yolo/) -- a forum whose front page, is, *according to its own standards*, almost entirely [full of shit](https://imgur.com/vlbl1hT).\n\nI don't know what you would be doing, exactly, but it would be a lot more productive than being on this forum.  You would be the kind of person who, if they were subscribed to a subreddit, would subscribe to one involving something like [studying](https://reddit.com/r/LSAT/) for a [test](https://reddit.com/r/GRE/) that is actually challenging or [asking someone](https://reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/) who knows [more than you](https://reddit.com/r/askscience/) something more complex than \"drrr, but what ticker do I buy puts on tho?\"  Actually, you would be the one helping people study, and the one providing in-depth answers on subjects that you do actually know about, and you would not have to be told to *shut the fuck up* on topics that you don't know about, because you have enough of a brain to know that, no matter who you are, the list of things you don't know is *infinitely fucking longer* than the things you do know.  And guess what?  This is especially true for things like this virus (which naturally you refer to as the \"beer virus\" because everything is a joke to you) because *there is no good historical analogy to the current situation we are in*.  \n\n\"But the experts!  I listened to them!\" you say.  Well, first of all, I imagine that some of you did, but most of you just repeated the thing that you heard or read somewhere else, because apparently your sole purpose in life is to act as a vector for shitty memes and deadly viruses.  But anyway, even if you did do your best to find an in-depth analysis on possible scenarios, maybe even [one with actual math](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf), guess what? I can find an [argument pointing out its crucial flaws](https://necsi.edu/review-of-ferguson-et-al-impact-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions).  I might even be able to find [a contrary analysis by the same fucking author](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Global-Impact-26-03-2020.pdf) written 10 days later.  Okay, fine, that shit was from the Brits, fuck them and their tea, let's try to find a more reliable resource, maybe by a dude who likes baseball and poker, because those are related to epidemiology and the economy, right?  His site contacted a bunch of unnamed experts and asked them what they thought, and guess what?  [They don't know either](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/experts-say-the-coronavirus-outlook-has-worsened-but-the-trajectory-is-still-unclear/).  To be specific, [this graphic](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/boice.EXPERT-SURVEY.0325-5fix.png?w=575) has the title \"Still a lot of uncertainty around coronavirus' death toll.\"  In case that title and the linked graphic are both too hard for you to understand, it means some of their \"experts\" said \"WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL DIE.  POSSIBLY MILLIONS.\"  But then again, a smaller number of their \"experts\" had estimates with an upper range below 200,000.  Translation:  *Those* people said, \"WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL DIE, BUT MILLIONS?  NO WAY!!\"\n\n\"But there's no way some of these companies will survive!  I even read their 10-K like my Daddy told me to, and they have negative cashflow, and are overleveraged!!\" you say.  First of all, good for you for [listening to your daddy](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/).  You should [do that](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fplquv/something_fishy_fuzzys_seas_covenant_breakdown/).  I am just your crazy fucking uncle who knows jack-all about anything but is self-aware enough to know it and to recognize it in other people.  So don't listen to me if you don't want.\n\nBut hear this: Do you know when people will be allowed to go back to work again?  To travel again?  Do you know when they actually will decide to do that?  How, prithee, doth thee knoweth, O gayest of the Gay Knights in all the Rainbow Kingdom?  Have you considered how much of an impact all this [totalitarian-style social distancing](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/) or [lack thereof](https://nypost.com/2020/03/24/coronavirus-in-nyc-subway-cut-backs-leads-to-packed-commute/) will have, and how much impact our lack of ability to protect the people who are taking care of the sick will have?  Have you compared the different measures that different states are taking and compared their effectiveness? Have you considered the fact that we have a wildly unpredictable, impetuous, reality TV star for a president? Have you thought about the fact that we could have a second wave, or we could not, or the virus could mutate and become less deadly, or it could not, or anti-viral drugs could be effective, but most likely not, or the fact that the American people are, on the one hand, very resourceful and willing to pull together in times of crisis, while on the other hand, they [suck at math](https://qz.com/638845/americans-are-spectacularly-bad-at-answering-even-the-most-basic-math-questions/) and they suck especially hard at statistics because [they aren't even taught that shit in high school](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/05/23/calculus-is-the-peak-of-high-school.html?intc=main-mpsmvs), even though it kind of seems important in times like these? If you have thought about all those things and all the other relevant variables which somehow you were able to exhaustively enumerate, and you have been able to predict exactly when, *or even approximately when*, economic activity will pick back up again, along with how and when institutional investors will respond, so you can ride your very own gay bear train to the land of milk and rainbow-colored honey, then congratulations, and this post doesn't apply to you.  But let's be honest: it almost certainly fucking does. So have fun making bets, don't piss away your life savings because you got caught up in the hype, and for the sake of my immunocompromised wife with an anxiety disorder, keep *washing your damn hands like you fucking mean it*.",

        "selftext": "I shared this post over the weekend about how Robinhood purchased $310,000 worth of shares on my behalf without me placing an order for it, and issuing a margin call and locking down my account. No, I didn\u2019t have any spreads or even calls or puts on these companies. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fivlm3/robinhood\\_purchased\\_1000\\_shares\\_of\\_biib\\_on\\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fivlm3/robinhood_purchased_1000_shares_of_biib_on_my/)\n\nSo here's Day 2 of what happened next. \n\nI sent them emails with screenshots on Friday. They still haven't responded to me yet. My account is still locked out. I can't trade. Can't close my existing call credit spreads (to capture this huge down move) either because of the app alerting me on buying power requirement. On the positive note, it appears they have reversed BIIB stock purchase but INTC is still there. My buying power has improved from negative 300k to negative 5k. \n\nHave no idea what's going on. Haven't heard a word back from them.\n\nIts one thing to read other people's terrible experiences with RH here on wsb but it's another thing to go through that ordeal yourself. You feel so helpless when your money is stuck and you don't even get an email response from your brokerage, let alone a phone call. This was my lesson learned. Already moved over to ToS now. Do it guys, while you still can. If you play spreads on Options, then do it even faster.",

        "selftext": "It's Sunday and people like me, working in the hospitality industry, need to stay home. I'm bored already, let's play a game.\n\nLet's say you get 30k cash and you need to spend it equally on 3 stocks, 10k each, to hold for at least 5 years. Rates are what they are now, we're not discussing to buy later.\n\nMine would be:\n- AMD. They have a deal with US navy to deliver supercomputers beginning 2021, they are most popular amongst gamers and they're way ahead of Intel in terms of financials.\n- DAL. Because of the rate mostly. They also pay dividend, are financially stable and one of the biggest airlines in US. Air travel will never cease to exist. \n- GOOGL. Tech giant, so diverse in their working field. Working on AI as well for a long time now. Could not imagine my phone or laptop without Google. In these fake social media times, I thought about going back to an old phone, but Google and Google Maps are mainly keeping me from doing it, I would get fucking lost on vacation.\n\nSo what would be your picks?",

        "selftext": "So I wanted to share my thoughts on the overall market outlook and what to do with your money when it comes to stocks, 401k, IRAs, and Mortgages. I know most people reading this have probably never experienced anything remotely close to this before in their lifetime. The information I am going to go over below are just my personal opinions and what I would do.\n\n### Market Outlook\n\nI'm going to break this portion up into three sections. The first section I will discuss the earlier issues we experienced with COVID-19 in China. The second section will go over how COVID-19 impacts the market over the next 6-12 months. And the third section I will discuss what I call \"The Perfect Storm\".\n\n**Big Business Supply Chain**\n\nSo to start we need to understand how the original impacts of COVID-19 in China have and will impact our market. Over 75% of US companies had their supply chains disrupted due to China having to shut down during the outbreak. Why does this matter? Well think about some of the big companies that had this happen, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel. A lot of these companies have already come out and said that they are going to miss their expected earnings during the next quarter. I believe this is already somewhat priced in but I believe the recovery time for these business will be much longer than 1 quarter. You can expect most of these companies to suffer from this for the next 6-9 months at least. So now you have to realize that a lot of large corporations are going to miss their quarterly earnings for up to the next year.\n\n**COVID-19 and the United States**\n\nWe just briefly went over how these businesses supply chains got thrown out of whack and could take up to a year to recover. Now COVID-19 has crept its way into the US and is already presenting some big time operational issues for these same businesses that are already dealing with supply chain problems. As you may have heard over the past couple days a lot of businesses are trying to find ways to allow employees to work remotely or sending people home, schools are shutting down, sporting leagues are getting suspended and this is just the first few thousand cases that have been identified. How does this impact the market? Well, let's think about tech companies, a lot of these companies have yearly computer, phone, smart device, tablet upgrades. How are they going to meet that demand when they had supply chain delays in China and are now experiencing operations slow downs in the US? Point blank - they aren't. Most of these companies are more than likely to announce significant delays in product launches which is going to trigger uncertainty from shareholders which will result in drop in stock prices. This is going to be a prevalent theme for quite a while. This is going to cause fear in investors and continue to see heavier sell volume than buy volume over the next 6-9 months until these companies stabilize again.\n\n**The Perfect Storm**\n\nLet me breakdown what I am calling the perfect storm and why I think it is going to shake things up further with the market. The first part of this perfect storm is what I covered above which is COVID-19, I already detailed why this is going to impact the market and have a lasting effect over the next 6 months. The second part is the recent Saudi Arabia and Russia oil price wars, the oil and gas sector has taken a huge hit due to this and combined that with COVID-19 and travel bans, you now have a pandemic across the world and a war on oil overseas. The third and final piece of this perfect storm is the upcoming election. The run-up to an election always shakes up the stock market because you have all these shareholders having uncertainty when it comes to the candidates and who is going to be best for businesses and who is projected to win and this causes major ebbs and flows in the market as we get closer to a presidential election. So now lets review, we have uncertainty with COVID-19 and what the current and future impacts will be. We have uncertainty on the oil price war overseas and how that's going to play out, and in about 3-4 months we will have uncertainty within the market around the election. Combining all these factors we will see some continued significant drops over the next 12 month period.\n\nAt this point I do believe we will fall into an economic recession based off the above information, we will be in a downtrend for at least the next 6 months and depending on how long it takes the US to recover from COVID-19 we could see the impact for at least 1 year potentially longer.\n\n### Ok, So What Do I Do With My Money?\n\nLet's kick things off by discussing your 401k, so I'm sure some of you that are younger may be freaking out a bit and wondering should I sell out of my 401k funds and just keep the account cash? Should I move the funds into bonds? Let me give you this to think on, so lets say you can't withdraw your 401k for at least another 10 years, in my opinion your best bet is to leave your 401k alone, don't touch it. You may think, how does that make any sense? Well for starters the market always bounces back so I wouldn't worry too much about seeing your account balance go down in the short term, always remember that your 401k is a long term play. The other factor is you can view this as an opportunity, I would recommend to continue to put money towards your 401k as it allows you to essentially average yourself down on the shares that you currently have. This presents a great opportunity for you to see a nice increase in the shares you buy now and for the foreseeable future because those shares will eventually become very profitable once the market comes out of the bear market/recession a few years from now. Think about the prices that people were able to buy their 401k shares at back in 2008 and how much of a come up they have seen since. Have that mindset going into this upcoming time.\n\nThe next topic I wanted to touch on is something I have gotten a lot of questions on the past few weeks, which is investors and traders asking me What Should I Buy Into? Well right now, I believe the answer is: Nothing! In my opinion COVID-19 news is going to get worse, more cases, more business and educational challenges, more high profile people getting diagnosed. Remember when China first had the outbreak it grew exponentially the first few weeks before leveling off, the same thing is going to happen in the US. Until we start to see it level off a bit, then market is going to see some violent swings to the downside, I don't believe a good buying opportunity will present itself for at least another 10-14 days maybe longer. Once we get past the brunt of it, I believe some of the best longer term plays to invest in will be the Oil and Gas sector. Two of the leaders in this sector are COP and XOM, these stocks pay a nice dividend, are sector leaders and have been around forever. They both have lost roughly 50% of their per share value and are setup well for you to make a healthy return within the next few years. Look back when these stocks took a dive in 2016 and the recovery they have had since. This presents another great opportunity to buy in and hold for some big returns. Just remember, you more than likely will not catch the very bottom on these stocks, I recommend entering with a starter position and gradually scale yourself in to maximize your potential returns.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to touch on is your mortgage. A lot of people are inquiring about refinancing their homes right now. This is not a bad idea if you can at least shave 0.75 points off your interest rate. However, I personally believe rates will continue to drop as we go through these trying times, I believe the opportunity will present itself over the next 6 months to get an even lower rate. I also believe we may see additional federal rate cuts to assist homeowners and help with the potential economic recession we will be entering. I would recommend if you really need to refinance to help out your financial situation right now then go ahead and do it if you will save more than 0.75 points by doing so. However, if you are in a more comfortable position currently you may want to hold out a little longer for the potential of snagging an even lower rate and presenting yourself with a better financial opportunity.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThat about wraps up my market outlook and my thoughts on how to best handle your money during these times. I believe if you are on the younger side, don't get discouraged about what's happening, look at it as an opportunity to grow your financial wealth and knowledge. We are in weird time where a lot of uncertainty is entering the market and our daily lives. I recommend checking out some stock charts and information from back in the 1980s or 2008 to see what happened and how the market recovered and think about the opportunity you may presented with to capitalize on this and set yourself up well for the future.\n\nHope you enjoyed this information and found it informative.

        "selftext": "Every advice I read on holding losing stocks say to hold them if you continue to believe in the stocks. Yes I have excellent stocks such as AMZN, MSFT, MU, INTC, QCOM I still believe in them but they continue to plunge down into the rabbit hole every day. If I had sold it on Friday I would have cut 50% of the losses I have now. If I had sold it a week ago, would have cut 75% of the losses. I have bought on margin and am soon going to get margin calls for liquidation. What is the fucking point of saying hold, hold, hold if you still believe in the stock then?",

        "selftext": "So I wanted to share my thoughts on the overall market outlook and what to do with your money when it comes to stocks, 401k, IRAs, and Mortgages. I know most people reading this have probably never experienced anything remotely close to this before in their lifetime. The information I am going to go over below are just my personal opinions and what I would do.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nI'm going to break this portion up into three sections. The first section I will discuss the earlier issues we experienced with COVID-19 in China. The second section will go over how COVID-19 impacts the market over the next 6-12 months. And the third section I will discuss what I call \"The Perfect Storm\".\n\n**Big Business Supply Chain**\n\nSo to start we need to understand how the original impacts of COVID-19 in China have and will impact our market. Over 75% of US companies had their supply chains disrupted due to China having to shut down during the outbreak. Why does this matter? Well think about some of the big companies that had this happen, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel. A lot of these companies have already come out and said that they are going to miss their expected earnings during the next quarter. I believe this is already somewhat priced in but I believe the recovery time for these business will be much longer than 1 quarter. You can expect most of these companies to suffer from this for the next 6-9 months at least. So now you have to realize that a lot of large corporations are going to miss their quarterly earnings for up to the next year.\n\n**COVID-19 and the United States**\n\nWe just briefly went over how these businesses supply chains got thrown out of whack and could take up to a year to recover. Now COVID-19 has crept its way into the US and is already presenting some big time operational issues for these same businesses that are already dealing with supply chain problems. As you may have heard over the past couple days a lot of businesses are trying to find ways to allow employees to work remotely or sending people home, schools are shutting down, sporting leagues are getting suspended and this is just the first few thousand cases that have been identified. How does this impact the market? Well, let's think about tech companies, a lot of these companies have yearly computer, phone, smart device, tablet upgrades. How are they going to meet that demand when they had supply chain delays in China and are now experiencing operations slow downs in the US? Point blank - they aren't. Most of these companies are more than likely to announce significant delays in product launches which is going to trigger uncertainty from shareholders which will result in drop in stock prices. This is going to be a prevalent theme for quite a while. This is going to cause fear in investors and continue to see heavier sell volume than buy volume over the next 6-9 months until these companies stabilize again.\n\n**The Perfect Storm**\n\nLet me breakdown what I am calling the perfect storm and why I think it is going to shake things up further with the market. The first part of this perfect storm is what I covered above which is COVID-19, I already detailed why this is going to impact the market and have a lasting effect over the next 6 months. The second part is the recent Saudi Arabia and Russia oil price wars, the oil and gas sector has taken a huge hit due to this and combined that with COVID-19 and travel bans, you now have a pandemic across the world and a war on oil overseas. The third and final piece of this perfect storm is the upcoming election. The run-up to an election always shakes up the stock market because you have all these shareholders having uncertainty when it comes to the candidates and who is going to be best for businesses and who is projected to win and this causes major ebbs and flows in the market as we get closer to a presidential election. So now lets review, we have uncertainty with COVID-19 and what the current and future impacts will be. We have uncertainty on the oil price war overseas and how that's going to play out, and in about 3-4 months we will have uncertainty within the market around the election. Combining all these factors we will see some continued significant drops over the next 12 month period.\n\nAt this point I do believe we will fall into an economic recession based off the above information, we will be in a downtrend for at least the next 6 months and depending on how long it takes the US to recover from COVID-19 we could see the impact for at least 1 year potentially longer.\n\nOk, So What Do I Do With My Money?\n\nLet's kick things off by discussing your 401k, so I'm sure some of you that are younger may be freaking out a bit and wondering should I sell out of my 401k funds and just keep the account cash? Should I move the funds into bonds? Let me give you this to think on, so lets say you can't withdraw your 401k for at least another 10 years, in my opinion your best bet is to leave your 401k alone, don't touch it. You may think, how does that make any sense? Well for starters the market always bounces back so I wouldn't worry too much about seeing your account balance go down in the short term, always remember that your 401k is a long term play. The other factor is you can view this as an opportunity, I would recommend to continue to put money towards your 401k as it allows you to essentially average yourself down on the shares that you currently have. This presents a great opportunity for you to see a nice increase in the shares you buy now and for the foreseeable future because those shares will eventually become very profitable once the market comes out of the bear market/recession a few years from now. Think about the prices that people were able to buy their 401k shares at back in 2008 and how much of a come up they have seen since. Have that mindset going into this upcoming time.\n\nThe next topic I wanted to touch on is something I have gotten a lot of questions on the past few weeks, which is investors and traders asking me What Should I Buy Into? Well right now, I believe the answer is: Nothing! In my opinion COVID-19 news is going to get worse, more cases, more business and educational challenges, more high profile people getting diagnosed. Remember when China first had the outbreak it grew exponentially the first few weeks before leveling off, the same thing is going to happen in the US. Until we start to see it level off a bit, then market is going to see some violent swings to the downside, I don't believe a good buying opportunity will present itself for at least another 10-14 days maybe longer. Once we get past the brunt of it, I believe some of the best longer term plays to invest in will be the Oil and Gas sector. Two of the leaders in this sector are COP and XOM, these stocks pay a nice dividend, are sector leaders and have been around forever. They both have lost roughly 50% of their per share value and are setup well for you to make a healthy return within the next few years. Look back when these stocks took a dive in 2016 and the recovery they have had since. This presents another great opportunity to buy in and hold for some big returns. Just remember, you more than likely will not catch the very bottom on these stocks, I recommend entering with a starter position and gradually scale yourself in to maximize your potential returns.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to touch on is your mortgage. A lot of people are inquiring about refinancing their homes right now. This is not a bad idea if you can at least shave 0.75 points off your interest rate. However, I personally believe rates will continue to drop as we go through these trying times, I believe the opportunity will present itself over the next 6 months to get an even lower rate. I also believe we may see additional federal rate cuts to assist homeowners and help with the potential economic recession we will be entering. I would recommend if you really need to refinance to help out your financial situation right now then go ahead and do it if you will save more than 0.75 points by doing so. However, if you are in a more comfortable position currently you may want to hold out a little longer for the potential of snagging an even lower rate and presenting yourself with a better financial opportunity.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThat about wraps up my market outlook and my thoughts on how to best handle your money during these times. I believe if you are on the younger side, don't get discouraged about what's happening, look at it as an opportunity to grow your financial wealth and knowledge. We are in weird time where a lot of uncertainty is entering the market and our daily lives. I recommend checking out some stock charts and information from back in the 1980s or 2008 to see what happened and how the market recovered and think about the opportunity you may presented with to capitalize on this and set yourself up well for the future.\n\nHope you enjoyed this information and found it informative.

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Positions](https://imgur.com/gallery/aPzFTne)\n\nThis may or may not be the bottom but I decided to hop in on what I believe to be some highly discounted securities.  \n\n$AMD is looking to take over $INTC market share and so far they have been doing a good job.  Regardless of whether or not they still have their Financial Analyst day on 05 March 2020 they are still primed to take off.  Almost all of the recent processors they have released have resulted in backorders and lines at retailers for people to buy the products, sometimes well over MSRP.  There is evidence to suggest $AAPL is looking at using their processors in the near to medium term future as well.  This of course would make the company pop.  After reaching a high of $59.27 I picked these up on Coronavirus fears at $46.40, around 21% discount from their recent high. \n\n$MSFT has been through the ringer lately.  With $AMZN whining about the JEDI contract, to Coronavirus fears this thing has just been pummeled.  With a recent high of $190.70 and picking these up at $165.39 these are at about 13.27% discount.  I suspect they will be allowed to continue with their JEDI contract because attempting implicate federal employees in any wrongdoing is seriously difficult due to the \"Discretionary\" nature of awarding contracts.\n\n$TAN is Invesco's Solar Energy ETF.  With the world looking to renewables and green energy this is a no brainer. \n\n$PBD is Invesco's Global Clean Energy ETF.  Again, renewables are a no brainer and while $TAN focuses on solar, this encompasses all forms of clean energy. \n\nI bought protective puts where needed/available, $TAN &amp; $AMD.  My $MSFT position is 10 shares and I have a stop loss in place that I'll adjust daily.  $PBD provides no options for protection, so manually adjusting stop losses daily here as well",

        "selftext": "So I wanted to share my thoughts on the overall market outlook and what to do with your money when it comes to stocks, 401k, IRAs, and Mortgages. I know most people reading this have probably never experienced anything remotely close to this before in their lifetime. The information I am going to go over below are just my personal opinions and what I would do.\n\n### Market Outlook\n\nI'm going to break this portion up into three sections. The first section I will discuss the earlier issues we experienced with COVID-19 in China. The second section will go over how COVID-19 impacts the market over the next 6-12 months. And the third section I will discuss what I call \"The Perfect Storm\".\n\n**Big Business Supply Chain**\n\nSo to start we need to understand how the original impacts of COVID-19 in China have and will impact our market. Over 75% of US companies had their supply chains disrupted due to China having to shut down during the outbreak. Why does this matter? Well think about some of the big companies that had this happen, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel. A lot of these companies have already come out and said that they are going to miss their expected earnings during the next quarter. I believe this is already somewhat priced in but I believe the recovery time for these business will be much longer than 1 quarter. You can expect most of these companies to suffer from this for the next 6-9 months at least. So now you have to realize that a lot of large corporations are going to miss their quarterly earnings for up to the next year.\n\n**COVID-19 and the United States**\n\nWe just briefly went over how these businesses supply chains got thrown out of whack and could take up to a year to recover. Now COVID-19 has crept its way into the US and is already presenting some big time operational issues for these same businesses that are already dealing with supply chain problems. As you may have heard over the past couple days a lot of businesses are trying to find ways to allow employees to work remotely or sending people home, schools are shutting down, sporting leagues are getting suspended and this is just the first few thousand cases that have been identified. How does this impact the market? Well, let's think about tech companies, a lot of these companies have yearly computer, phone, smart device, tablet upgrades. How are they going to meet that demand when they had supply chain delays in China and are now experiencing operations slow downs in the US? Point blank - they aren't. Most of these companies are more than likely to announce significant delays in product launches which is going to trigger uncertainty from shareholders which will result in drop in stock prices. This is going to be a prevalent theme for quite a while. This is going to cause fear in investors and continue to see heavier sell volume than buy volume over the next 6-9 months until these companies stabilize again.\n\n**The Perfect Storm**\n\nLet me breakdown what I am calling the perfect storm and why I think it is going to shake things up further with the market. The first part of this perfect storm is what I covered above which is COVID-19, I already detailed why this is going to impact the market and have a lasting effect over the next 6 months. The second part is the recent Saudi Arabia and Russia oil price wars, the oil and gas sector has taken a huge hit due to this and combined that with COVID-19 and travel bans, you now have a pandemic across the world and a war on oil overseas. The third and final piece of this perfect storm is the upcoming election. The run-up to an election always shakes up the stock market because you have all these shareholders having uncertainty when it comes to the candidates and who is going to be best for businesses and who is projected to win and this causes major ebbs and flows in the market as we get closer to a presidential election. So now lets review, we have uncertainty with COVID-19 and what the current and future impacts will be. We have uncertainty on the oil price war overseas and how that's going to play out, and in about 3-4 months we will have uncertainty within the market around the election. Combining all these factors we will see some continued significant drops over the next 12 month period.\n\nAt this point I do believe we will fall into an economic recession based off the above information, we will be in a downtrend for at least the next 6 months and depending on how long it takes the US to recover from COVID-19 we could see the impact for at least 1 year potentially longer.\n\n### Ok, So What Do I Do With My Money?\n\nLet's kick things off by discussing your 401k, so I'm sure some of you that are younger may be freaking out a bit and wondering should I sell out of my 401k funds and just keep the account cash? Should I move the funds into bonds? Let me give you this to think on, so lets say you can't withdraw your 401k for at least another 10 years, in my opinion your best bet is to leave your 401k alone, don't touch it. You may think, how does that make any sense? Well for starters the market always bounces back so I wouldn't worry too much about seeing your account balance go down in the short term, always remember that your 401k is a long term play. The other factor is you can view this as an opportunity, I would recommend to continue to put money towards your 401k as it allows you to essentially average yourself down on the shares that you currently have. This presents a great opportunity for you to see a nice increase in the shares you buy now and for the foreseeable future because those shares will eventually become very profitable once the market comes out of the bear market/recession a few years from now. Think about the prices that people were able to buy their 401k shares at back in 2008 and how much of a come up they have seen since. Have that mindset going into this upcoming time.\n\nThe next topic I wanted to touch on is something I have gotten a lot of questions on the past few weeks, which is investors and traders asking me What Should I Buy Into? Well right now, I believe the answer is: Nothing! In my opinion COVID-19 news is going to get worse, more cases, more business and educational challenges, more high profile people getting diagnosed. Remember when China first had the outbreak it grew exponentially the first few weeks before leveling off, the same thing is going to happen in the US. Until we start to see it level off a bit, then market is going to see some violent swings to the downside, I don't believe a good buying opportunity will present itself for at least another 10-14 days maybe longer. Once we get past the brunt of it, I believe some of the best longer term plays to invest in will be the Oil and Gas sector. Two of the leaders in this sector are COP and XOM, these stocks pay a nice dividend, are sector leaders and have been around forever. They both have lost roughly 50% of their per share value and are setup well for you to make a healthy return within the next few years. Look back when these stocks took a dive in 2016 and the recovery they have had since. This presents another great opportunity to buy in and hold for some big returns. Just remember, you more than likely will not catch the very bottom on these stocks, I recommend entering with a starter position and gradually scale yourself in to maximize your potential returns.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to touch on is your mortgage. A lot of people are inquiring about refinancing their homes right now. This is not a bad idea if you can at least shave 0.75 points off your interest rate. However, I personally believe rates will continue to drop as we go through these trying times, I believe the opportunity will present itself over the next 6 months to get an even lower rate. I also believe we may see additional federal rate cuts to assist homeowners and help with the potential economic recession we will be entering. I would recommend if you really need to refinance to help out your financial situation right now then go ahead and do it if you will save more than 0.75 points by doing so. However, if you are in a more comfortable position currently you may want to hold out a little longer for the potential of snagging an even lower rate and presenting yourself with a better financial opportunity.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThat about wraps up my market outlook and my thoughts on how to best handle your money during these times. I believe if you are on the younger side, don't get discouraged about what's happening, look at it as an opportunity to grow your financial wealth and knowledge. We are in weird time where a lot of uncertainty is entering the market and our daily lives. I recommend checking out some stock charts and information from back in the 1980s or 2008 to see what happened and how the market recovered and think about the opportunity you may presented with to capitalize on this and set yourself up well for the future.\n\nHope you enjoyed this information and found it informative.

        "selftext": "Analyst day was largely as expected. It was encouraging to hear management reconfirm Q1 guidance, although sales may come in at the low end due to the coronavirus (not a surprise at this point). Most assume sales will pick back up in the 2H, so full year street estimates are unlikely to changing much from this event.\n\nAMD's pivot in GPU strategy from general-purpose GPUs to domain-specific GPUs seems like a smart move in adapting to the market evolution. The Radeon DNA will be optimized for gaming, while Compute DNA will be optimized for machine learning etc.\n\nAMD's market share gain story has been rewarding for shareholders, but the biggest push-back now is its valuation (\\~33x forward PE vs. \\~19x for peer group), leaving some to wonder if all the good news has been priced in. AMD will likely get a top-line boost in 2H from gaming console refresh, but this is a low margin business.\n\nAs the \"second horse\" in the declining PC market, AMD still needs to prove it has a long-term profitable business model. $INTC and $NVDA appear to be in better financial position to strengthen their positions in both CPU and GPU markets. AMD chasing the low-margin gaming business could hinder its ability to improve profitability.",

        "selftext": "So I wanted to share my thoughts on the overall market outlook and what to do with your money when it comes to stocks, 401k, IRAs, and Mortgages. I know most people reading this have probably never experienced anything remotely close to this before in their lifetime. The information I am going to go over below are just my personal opinions and what I would do.\n\n### Market Outlook\n\nI'm going to break this portion up into three sections. The first section I will discuss the earlier issues we experienced with COVID-19 in China. The second section will go over how COVID-19 impacts the market over the next 6-12 months. And the third section I will discuss what I call \"The Perfect Storm\".\n\n**Big Business Supply Chain**\n\nSo to start we need to understand how the original impacts of COVID-19 in China have and will impact our market. Over 75% of US companies had their supply chains disrupted due to China having to shut down during the outbreak. Why does this matter? Well think about some of the big companies that had this happen, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel. A lot of these companies have already come out and said that they are going to miss their expected earnings during the next quarter. I believe this is already somewhat priced in but I believe the recovery time for these business will be much longer than 1 quarter. You can expect most of these companies to suffer from this for the next 6-9 months at least. So now you have to realize that a lot of large corporations are going to miss their quarterly earnings for up to the next year.\n\n**COVID-19 and the United States**\n\nWe just briefly went over how these businesses supply chains got thrown out of whack and could take up to a year to recover. Now COVID-19 has crept its way into the US and is already presenting some big time operational issues for these same businesses that are already dealing with supply chain problems. As you may have heard over the past couple days a lot of businesses are trying to find ways to allow employees to work remotely or sending people home, schools are shutting down, sporting leagues are getting suspended and this is just the first few thousand cases that have been identified. How does this impact the market? Well, let's think about tech companies, a lot of these companies have yearly computer, phone, smart device, tablet upgrades. How are they going to meet that demand when they had supply chain delays in China and are now experiencing operations slow downs in the US? Point blank - they aren't. Most of these companies are more than likely to announce significant delays in product launches which is going to trigger uncertainty from shareholders which will result in drop in stock prices. This is going to be a prevalent theme for quite a while. This is going to cause fear in investors and continue to see heavier sell volume than buy volume over the next 6-9 months until these companies stabilize again.\n\n**The Perfect Storm**\n\nLet me breakdown what I am calling the perfect storm and why I think it is going to shake things up further with the market. The first part of this perfect storm is what I covered above which is COVID-19, I already detailed why this is going to impact the market and have a lasting effect over the next 6 months. The second part is the recent Saudi Arabia and Russia oil price wars, the oil and gas sector has taken a huge hit due to this and combined that with COVID-19 and travel bans, you now have a pandemic across the world and a war on oil overseas. The third and final piece of this perfect storm is the upcoming election. The run-up to an election always shakes up the stock market because you have all these shareholders having uncertainty when it comes to the candidates and who is going to be best for businesses and who is projected to win and this causes major ebbs and flows in the market as we get closer to a presidential election. So now lets review, we have uncertainty with COVID-19 and what the current and future impacts will be. We have uncertainty on the oil price war overseas and how that's going to play out, and in about 3-4 months we will have uncertainty within the market around the election. Combining all these factors we will see some continued significant drops over the next 12 month period.\n\nAt this point I do believe we will fall into an economic recession based off the above information, we will be in a downtrend for at least the next 6 months and depending on how long it takes the US to recover from COVID-19 we could see the impact for at least 1 year potentially longer.\n\n### Ok, So What Do I Do With My Money?\n\nLet's kick things off by discussing your 401k, so I'm sure some of you that are younger may be freaking out a bit and wondering should I sell out of my 401k funds and just keep the account cash? Should I move the funds into bonds? Let me give you this to think on, so lets say you can't withdraw your 401k for at least another 10 years, in my opinion your best bet is to leave your 401k alone, don't touch it. You may think, how does that make any sense? Well for starters the market always bounces back so I wouldn't worry too much about seeing your account balance go down in the short term, always remember that your 401k is a long term play. The other factor is you can view this as an opportunity, I would recommend to continue to put money towards your 401k as it allows you to essentially average yourself down on the shares that you currently have. This presents a great opportunity for you to see a nice increase in the shares you buy now and for the foreseeable future because those shares will eventually become very profitable once the market comes out of the bear market/recession a few years from now. Think about the prices that people were able to buy their 401k shares at back in 2008 and how much of a come up they have seen since. Have that mindset going into this upcoming time.\n\nThe next topic I wanted to touch on is something I have gotten a lot of questions on the past few weeks, which is investors and traders asking me What Should I Buy Into? Well right now, I believe the answer is: Nothing! In my opinion COVID-19 news is going to get worse, more cases, more business and educational challenges, more high profile people getting diagnosed. Remember when China first had the outbreak it grew exponentially the first few weeks before leveling off, the same thing is going to happen in the US. Until we start to see it level off a bit, then market is going to see some violent swings to the downside, I don't believe a good buying opportunity will present itself for at least another 10-14 days maybe longer. Once we get past the brunt of it, I believe some of the best longer term plays to invest in will be the Oil and Gas sector. Two of the leaders in this sector are COP and XOM, these stocks pay a nice dividend, are sector leaders and have been around forever. They both have lost roughly 50% of their per share value and are setup well for you to make a healthy return within the next few years. Look back when these stocks took a dive in 2016 and the recovery they have had since. This presents another great opportunity to buy in and hold for some big returns. Just remember, you more than likely will not catch the very bottom on these stocks, I recommend entering with a starter position and gradually scale yourself in to maximize your potential returns.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to touch on is your mortgage. A lot of people are inquiring about refinancing their homes right now. This is not a bad idea if you can at least shave 0.75 points off your interest rate. However, I personally believe rates will continue to drop as we go through these trying times, I believe the opportunity will present itself over the next 6 months to get an even lower rate. I also believe we may see additional federal rate cuts to assist homeowners and help with the potential economic recession we will be entering. I would recommend if you really need to refinance to help out your financial situation right now then go ahead and do it if you will save more than 0.75 points by doing so. However, if you are in a more comfortable position currently you may want to hold out a little longer for the potential of snagging an even lower rate and presenting yourself with a better financial opportunity.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThat about wraps up my market outlook and my thoughts on how to best handle your money during these times. I believe if you are on the younger side, don't get discouraged about what's happening, look at it as an opportunity to grow your financial wealth and knowledge. We are in weird time where a lot of uncertainty is entering the market and our daily lives. I recommend checking out some stock charts and information from back in the 1980s or 2008 to see what happened and how the market recovered and think about the opportunity you may presented with to capitalize on this and set yourself up well for the future.\n\nHope you enjoyed this information and found it informative.

        "selftext": "You think Trump is gonna allow the economy to call per months before election? Fuck no, he will do anything and everything in the book, illegal or legal to save this ship. If he doesn\u2019t, he risks losing. I think he will emulate China in liquidating tons of cash in the market and downplaying the virus. I see a few Green Day\u2019s before the market inevitably corrects just like how it took a while for it to collapse this go round after China played dirty. This is the one time every powerful human agrees, fuck corona virus because it fucks with our ability to achieve our agenda. Media might just downplay it for a while to help out their billionaire buddies. Finally, the CDC has always talked about disease \u201cx\u201d. This is a disease that kills 80 mil people. Let\u2019s be honest, those numbers will be heavily skewed towards countries with bad infrastructure and bad healthcare. Essentially, poor countries will account for a vast majority of deaths, and old/compromised people will make up the rest. This is a correction due to every stock being over valued and at all time highs. Look at a 180 day candlestick chart, they all look the same, every company. All time highs, to massive drops to 180day to 1yr averages. I think the prices will drive buyers plus the realization that this won\u2019t truly effect us regardless if it hits max potential. Sorry this was so long I\u2019m fucking smacked boys.  And boys don\u2019t just buy calls or puts, if you have the capital sell a put, easy premium. Make the smart play, if you think it\u2019s gonna trend down, buy puts, up? Buy calls. Not sure? Spread. Have a tool bag of plays to use like a ducking plumber. The hammer don\u2019t work for everything, sometimes you need the wrench, or the screwdriver. As long as you diversify your plays to fit the situation, you can trade the same stock all the time. For example, I trust AMD and bought calls all year, then I waited and sold puts way otm for fat premium and cashed out. Meanwhile I bought puts and tenderized theta gang. Then Friday I thought it was all gonna go green, I went gainer my dd and bought $INTC calls expiring this Friday. Down like 50% on those contracts. Not only did it not go up, I bought it the second it was up when the cost was at its highest by a stupid amount. Played myself and hate my self for getting greedy. Pray for bull market Monday. \n\nTLDR: Buy cheap calls on shit like $TSLA, $AMZN, $AMD, $NVDA, $LULU, literally anything that is stupid cheap now. A lot of shit went green Friday and could be a song of upturn.",
