I know what you're thinking BUY MORE AMD! No you idiots AMD don't make shit. Who is currently building 2 new  sites in Arizona? INTC!. Who just announced they are dedicating output at a current site to auto chips? INTC!. Who just announced a \" big honkin \" $90 billion mega site in the EU. INTC!. INTC was one of the only tickers to pop hard Friday and hold green. Follow the smart money don't follow the drooling sheep.

In the long term always seems to keep up with the pace of new tech and has solid workforce and at least since they dropped Bannon, management is on point\n\nAMZN- Absolute monster. Hard to not want it in my line up. They will continue to grow and buy up/absorb new tech and not afraid to buy up the little guy to increase their market share.\n\nAMD- I like them for the fact that their tech has been setting the bar as of late. While Intel or Nvidia might be bigger and have more market share, i think AMD has more potential over a long term.\n\nHD- I like the grasp on the non tech market they have. They do well during economic growth. They sustain during economic lulls. And even though I'm a Lowes guy, they are the workhorse in household consumer goods and building materials.\n\nBA- Chose this over an airline because it moves with the same news, but is tied in closely with US Military spending and  will sustain over times of peace and war.\n\nNote: Honestly i invest 70ish% in funds.

        "selftext": "Companies which operate in duopolies often have wide moats which deliver good financial performance because they're less susceptible to new entrants, often due to high barriers to entry. Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. \n\nMy question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: \n\n$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. \n\n$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. \n\nSemiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves. \n\nWhat are some other ideas on duopolies? Open to any feedback on this strategy as well.",

I am going to snag his work and put it here for all you apes to adore, and believe the hype!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;begin\\_plagiarism&gt;*\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yj8bmpuzyp71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0a6f9f941f2dbfc78063d5256fccdab29a04b84\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes C\\*\\*\\* rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - C\\*\\*\\*-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o1stpusvzyp71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7eff1951a48874c28474791856d75dea6120ba\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izejluexzyp71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba9252ec9a4efe2cb550b385fa9c38099419f025\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhio20z00zp71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd5baa49a33a130763584fdb952fc85abc95bf32\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usm8geczzyp71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fffdc7aaae1f913ab3a9400a1133ad1212c0644\n\n\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8imlj130zp71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=210716737bce8e989efa725e986cdb45e242ac1c\n\nProject Gravity SUV\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blka49d40zp71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f1fb4ca97e2736af6a8c83c96c984716f1c3e2\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7ubjif50zp71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39d87075d7ed1e05626f32fdcb85bd59550a1c4e\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/buq3dei60zp71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a2698ee2c34a0a37850630aa50d9bf43d0beb3\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*18.33\\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.81\\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*12.7\\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\\*N/A *(see below)*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*N/A\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.",

Currently, we are heavily reliant on TSM and other international foundry businesses to fuel this necessity.

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Wait, Wait, before you downvote me into the depths of hells, let me explain. First, I have been contemplating buying puts on NVDA for about a month now, and it's kept on going up and the only reason I haven't pulled the trigger yet is because I feel like I'm missing something so let me explain my case, then you explain why I'm wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, first, NVDA is a 550 billion dollar company with 20 billion in revenue and a P/E of nearly 80, and a forward P/E of 60. This is literally SENILE, in 2000, when Intel was all the shit, as a 300 billion dollar company it had a P/E of 40, and now 20 years later it's still down while it's doubles it's revenue and 4x it's profit. So, with NVDA trading at a multiple of 80, even if let's say they 3x their eps in the next 5 years which is an extremely absurd assumption as they've already had a ton of growth fueled from cover, they would have 9 dollars of EPS and looking at today's stock price, if it stayed the same they would still be trading at a multiple of 24 which is ridiculous if they somehow just 4x their revenue in a matter of 5 years. Looking at all the growth catalysts I would find it only somewhat reasonable if they 2x their profit which would give them 6 dollars of EPS and keep them at a P/E of 40. That is once again Intels multiple at the peak of 2000 when it was also half the market cap. \n\nLastly, NVDA has gone up nearly 100% from it's lows in February for two reasons, slightly better than expected earnings and a stock split, none of which would justify that movement. \n\nSo, that's what I'm thinking, I HAVE TO BE MISSING SOMETHING RIGHT?, why does this seem so overvalued as such a large company, can someone please explain because if not those 2024 140 strike price puts are looking real sexy.",

        "selftext": "I gotta tell you, this sector is pretty freaking exciting.   As a private pilot, the thought of eventually flying one of these planes is incredibly cool.   As much as Tesla has done to push EVs forward, what's happening in aviation is more meaningful.    The general aviation industry is comprised of planes that are often 50 years old.  Sure, many have been updated avionics from Garmin, but most planes lack any real development.  Yeah, Cirrus has done amazing work but for the most part, the technology hasn't changed.  Part of it has been lack of investment but that's changing now.  I think new companies like Lilium and Joby have seen what's being done in the auto industry and are saying \"we can do that.\"   Established companies like Airbus are probably saying \"we'd better get our shit together.\"   \n\nThere is no doubt that companies will fail.   I have no clue where the industry will be in 10yrs.   But, if you're psyched about what's happening in the EV space, it probably makes sense to take a look here.   Below is an article that does a great job summarizing this industry.   It's not written by a pump and dump shit publication but rather the association that helps promote and govern aviation.\n\nGood luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2021/september/pilot/evtols-score-big-bucks](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2021/september/pilot/evtols-score-big-bucks)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: From the article.\n\n\"Joby Aviation has attracted a large share of venture capital over the past year. Uber Elevate, the ride-sharing giant\u2019s air taxi concept, decided to walk away from that idea and throw support amounting to $75 million to Joby\u2019s S4, a 170-knot, 150-nautical-mile, five-seat eVTOL. Toyota, Intel, and JetBlue anted up another $820 million. Joby\u2019s Santa Cruz, California, factory has reportedly been expanded, and the company said it expects to hire 1,600 employees. Joby has raised some $1.5 billion. Reports indicate that the FAA has approved a certification pathway for the S4. Joby also says that pilot certification, airframe, and airspace regulations are in the works with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Certification and entry into service are expected in 2023.\"\n\n\"Two German designs have also apparently been making great headway. Lilium, maker of what it calls five- and seven-seat eVTOL \u201cjets,\u201d says that certification for both designs is in progress with the FAA and EASA. These are powered by 36 electrically driven, tiltable ducted fans set in the canard and wing trailing edges. Cruise speed is advertised as 150 knots, maximum altitude as 10,000 feet, and maximum range as 135 nm. Certification is expected in 2024, with entry into service in 2025. So far, Lilium has raised a reported $390 million. The company said it plans a network of \u201cvertiports\u201d that will let passengers fly between key cities in Florida. The first vertiport will be somewhere in South Florida.\"",

        "selftext": "Barrons\n\n President Biden\u2019s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it\u2019s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats\u2019 slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for. \n\nDon\u2019t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year\u2019s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed. \n\nFor instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC). Senyek sees McDonald\u2019s (MCD) as less tax sensitive than Domino\u2019s (DPZ), and Twitter (TWTR) as less so than Netflix (NFLX).\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-biden-corporate-tax-plan-51630663201?mod=RTA",

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9brk0w620oo71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e9e48b60a203a512e916039a142c8f77362a176\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lymm2dhxxno71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92228b5de309258f52e667bf370e4ed1b6d8322e\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Hey guys, who of you do never watch porn or never go on YouTube? Well, I guess, none of you. However, 3.7 billion people do not have any access to the Internet; poor dudes no porn, and no YouTube. Well, guess what, one company will make money anyway when these guys get access to the internet, and **I am not talking about PornHub, it is Nvidia!**\n\nNvidia is developing very quickly its chips for data centers and eats Intel's market share every day. Here is why, if you are not a retarded living in a cave, you should buy Nvidia (NVDA). \n\n# Crazy quarterly results: \n\nLast quarter's results were monstrous, **bears go back in your cave!**\n\n* Revenues: $6.51 billion versus $6.33 billion expected (dumb-ass analysts were not even close). \n* Revenue growth:  68% annually after a growth of 84% last quarter (get the rocket ready). \n* Adjusted earnings: $1.04, versus $1.01 expected (analysts cannot grasp how much money it makes).\n\n**Dude, have you ever seen a company with such growth?** In comparison, Facebook with its 39% % growth year-over-year looks like a boomer company.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here is why Nvidia is a cash cow for the coming years:**\n\n# Why you will make money in 1 year:\n\n\u00b7 Graphic cards (current biggest segment): **growth of 87%** to $3.91 billion. This is crazy growth, and the current valuation seems not to fully consider such growth, especially considering that it is the biggest segment of Nvidia. Nvidia has a PE of 79, it may look big, but Amazon (AMZN) has a PE of 59 and growth is tiny in comparison. Square (SQ) has a PE of more than 200.\n\n# Why you will make money in 3 years: \n\n\u00b7 Compute and network segment (chips for data centers): growth of 46% to $2.6 billion. This is crazy growth for a normal company, but it is not sufficient for Nvidia. However, the future looks sexy.\n\n\u00b7 Data are the future and companies are building data centers all the time. If Amazon invests so heavily in AWS, it is because the cloud is the future! Well, the more Amazon spends on the cloud, the more money Nvidia makes. **Demand for Nvidia chips is exploding**, especially when considering that they are way better than the one from Intel (boomers go home). The cake and the slice of the cake are growing for Nvidia and I will eat the cake as I am a shareholder!\n\n# Why you will make money in 5 years:\n\n\u00b7 Professional use: Industry will progressively get more automated and therefore needs more chips. Annually graphics cards for high-end professional workstations **went up 156% annually** to $519 million. This growth is tremendous and proves that demand is enormous. \n\n\u00b7 Secondly, its automotive business unit. Sales were up 37% from last year's respective quarter. This is poor growth (LOL) for Nvidia but the future looks awesome. If you think two seconds, you will realize that the future is not about EVs, the true revolution will be autonomous cars! And who will be the true winner? Tesla? No! Nio? No! Nvidia? Yeah boy, you got it! Considering the potential of this sector and how crazy people get \u201cjust\u201d with EVs, **Nvidia will not go to the moon but through the whole universe**, once people understand the potential of this division! \n\n# TLDR:\n\nBears have been repeating that Nvidia has been too expensive for a while. They have been repeating that it is not rational for the stock to double in 12 months and blablabla. Well, if they were not retarded, they would see that they are still **tons of catalysts** and the more time passes, the more we will use Nvidia products. So bears are gay and bulls are strong! \n\nPosition: because I do not live in a cave, I bought 50 shares, worth approximately 11,350 USD.",

AEye\u2019s iDAR\u2122 (Intelligent Detection and Ranging) system leverages biomimicry and principles from automated targeting applications used by the military to scan the environment, intelligently focusing on what matters most, enabling faster, more accurate, and more reliable perception. iDAR is the **ONLY software configurable LiDAR** (YOU READ THAT RIGHT) with integrated deterministic artificial intelligence, delivering industry-leading performance in range, resolution, and speed.

Luminar has a market cap of 5.86 billion as of today. That is almost 4x what LIDR is at right now.\n\n**Ape's instinct kicked in:**\n\nOkay I know this is retarded. You know what Luminar does? THEY MANUFACTURE LIDAR. What does this have to do with LIDR? LIDR manufactures LIDAR too. LIDR will definitely get recognition from its unique ticker symbol LIDR as it is so close to \u201cLIDAR\u201d (like i said , I am retarded.)

While many other LIDARs process in a linear or serial manner, **AEye parallel processes using a bistatic architecture**. This approach allows AEye to transmit and receive light out of separate paths, enabling the delivery of its iDAR\u2122 perception system and adaptive capabilities that power its [industry-leading range](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aeye.ai%2Fpress%2Fvsi-issues-independent-report-verifying-aeye-lidar-performance%2F&amp;esheet=52494954&amp;newsitemid=20210921005466&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=industry-leading+range&amp;index=3&amp;md5=f27492b3807e03e72c27093bbea60d99), resolution, refresh rates, agility and intelligence.\u201d\n\nAEye\u2019s patent portfolio can generally be organized into four groups:\n\n**1. Intelligent Modular Architecture**\n\nThis group of patents relate to AEye\u2019s intelligent modular bistatic architecture, system design, and its solid-state performing MEMs-based agile LiDAR. While many other LIDARs process in a linear or serial manner, AEye parallel processes using a bistatic architecture. This approach allows AEye to transmit and receive light out of separate paths, enabling the delivery of its iDAR\u2122 perception system and adaptive capabilities that power its industry-leading range, resolution, refresh rates, agility and intelligence. Equally important, AEye\u2019s design allows for flexibility in hardware packaging and vehicle placement options, unlike some LiDAR sensors that are limited to roof placement. These patents include protection of the overall architecture, of feedback techniques to keep the scanning where desired during vehicle vibration and temperature variation, as well as the ability to control detection pulse width and receiver bandwidth.\n\n**2. Open System and Extended Data Capabilities**\n\nA second group of patents focus on AEye\u2019s software definable AI technology and iDAR\u2019s ability to integrate other existing sensors, such as radar, cameras, and IMUs. These patents address AEye\u2019s unique co-boresighted design, wherein an HD camera and LiDAR receiver share the same optical axis, creating true color point clouds which enhance classification capabilities and eliminate the need for post-processing parallax correction. By co-boresighting the camera with the LiDAR receiver, AEye moves intelligence into the sensor. This enables the sensor to detect and immediately request additional data about objects and anomalies, then issue \"fast path\" priority message alerts to inform the motion planning system. By pushing detected threats to the top of the data stack under consideration by the motion planning system, AEye reduces central processing burdens, and speeds time to reaction.\n\n**3. Enhanced Data Quality**\n\nThe third group encompasses innovative features such as scan agility, which enables the sensor to \"acquire\" pre-classification attributes useful in accelerating perception systems. For example, AEye is able to pinpoint intra frame velocity by capturing both radial and lateral velocity, where most threats occur while driving. These patents build a software-defined layer upon the bistatic platform, and include the ability to optimize shot lists as a function of scenes and environment, novel tracking schemes, and tracking the horizon during car motion. The latter is an important aspect of agility and intelligence, as it reduces the required vertical scan field of view, and therefore reduces frame to frame time. iDAR\u2019s ability to enable software-defined frames and dynamic scan patterns and the platform\u2019s ability to deploy adaptive energy control on a pulse-by-pulse basis enables both the dynamic adjustment of scan patterns and the ability to adapt the laser energy for each pulse for complete interference mitigation.\n\n**4. Optical Data Networking**\n\nThe fourth group enables AEye to expand the capabilities of the AEye sensor to enable the laser to communicate information. This groundbreaking feature is uniquely enabled by AEye\u2019s adaptive LiDAR, in which the laser can be directed with precision. Pulsed message packets enable data to be transferred via line-of-sight. By using optical communications via the LiDAR system, AEye sensors can leverage a readily available, secure and reliable communications channel, which does not compete with the congested bandwidth of WiFi, cellular, and/or satellite communications, to transmit, receive, and/or transceive data.\n\n\"We set out to build a flexible architecture that could be expanded and adapted over time, adding new innovations. Our IP strategy, we believe, places us years ahead of others building single use hardware,\" said Dr. Allan Steinhardt, chief scientist at AEye. \"We will continue to push forward aggressively with developing and protecting competitive intellectual property to advance AEye\u2019s technological leadership. We are creating a thorough and rigorously defensible patent portfolio covering the architecture and software that underlie our solution.\"",

        "selftext": "I've spent over a year thinking about this, where I initially began as Facebook being my main holding. As an engineer I saw:\n\n- visionary, young CEO\n- their influence on the internet via the React development environment\n- their influence on networking via WhatsApp and low latency considerations (the number one reason I left Snapchat for Instagram many years ago in Mexico)\n- their historic imprint on social media \n- the VR hardware for future proofing\n\n\nAs an investor I saw:\n\n- an application with perverse incentives \n\n\nUltimately, after comparing FB to big tech, I feel that FB has the weakest moat compared to, say the logistics power of Amazon, the intelligence for Google, or IoT for Apple. FB has connection. \n\n- Slack in workspaces\n- Roblox in metaverse\n- Pinterest in social commerce\n- Discord in chat\n- TikTok in shorts\n- YouTube/Twitch in longforms\n- Reddit with communities\n- Twitter in messaging\n- Snapchat in snapshot media\n- Tinder in dating\n\nThe list goes on and on. The difference here is that these platforms are all EXCEPTIONALLY good at incentivizing their niche. Pinterest isn't just social e-commerce, it's also a search engine for ideas. Roblox isn't just a kids game, it's an education platform. Etc etc.\n\n\nPeople make the mistake that Facebook will eventually go the way of Myspace. This is wrong. It will remain as a dinosaur and fundamental to software, similar to that of Oracle or Intel. We already begin to see this at the application level where acquisitions of things like GIPHY inserts Facebook into the interfaces of applications like TikTok or Slack.\n\nMy view is that FB will see the beginning of the end with it's assertion into the metaverse.

        "selftext": "Barrons\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it\u2019s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats\u2019 slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for.\n\nDon\u2019t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year\u2019s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed.\n\nFor instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC). Senyek sees McDonald\u2019s (MCD) as less tax sensitive than Domino\u2019s (DPZ), and Twitter (TWTR) as less so than Netflix (NFLX).\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-biden-corporate-tax-plan-51630663201?mod=RTA",

So what's going on? Well... Lucid is having a PR event at their AZ factory this week. Word in the swamps? They are getting ready to announcing the first set of deliveries for the Lucid Air and confirming delivery dates! It's been speculated for awhile that the first deliveries was going to be sometime between Q3-Q4. There has been uncertainty with the chip shortage... but with this news, short$ will shit themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-announces-production-preview-week-at-amp-1](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-announces-production-preview-week-at-amp-1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR;**\n\n# LCID hitting production runs hard, will announce first deliveries schedule this week. Official EPA rating of 520 range. Plus with PIPE lockup expired 9/1, most of short term investors are done dumping shares. With that, and a week long PR event, very good chance they will set a date, and send the stock to URANUS!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredits for this DD, and a shoutout, goes to [u/ddroukas](https://www.reddit.com/user/ddroukas/). I am going to snag his work and put it here for all you apes to adore, and believe the hype!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;begin\\_plagiarism&gt;*\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vjvtldyn53q71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dc3f908a5b18e043ea1a2041f5af479d07ec99a\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson  promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes C\\*\\*\\* rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - C\\*\\*\\*-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/742fsz2s53q71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee54d570338efd1f787a0d4a97c5118525c0bc46\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oafhgqbr53q71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dadc97bad09abd70b1ee188a949316f617e22f1b\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwmzid2t53q71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b009d4938c971575d670084d7bd931e54aacf087\n\nProject Gravity SUV\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bfkjqzt53q71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b3d680faa5175e0bc8b9d67ad399fd31555f49\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mvvbpcv53q71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e542a44f9994017ad9185655a64c2596e80f58\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ic5i9cuw53q71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e18a5a865422e50420de66ffd9720dbf8e96f3a\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*18.33\\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.81\\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*12.7\\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\\*N/A \\*(see below)\\*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*N/A\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.",

But is this really true? Can markets go anywhere but up?\n\nSo far since the beginning of 2020\n\nOil is up 103%\n\nGas 94 %\n\ncopper which is key in all our electronics is up 126%\n\niron the most used metal is up 150%\n\ncoffee is up 101%\n\ncorn is up 78%\n\nwheat 49%\n\nand sugar 87%\n\nThe housing market is up, the collectible market is up and the stock market does not look any different.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 has recovered above pre covid levels and gained 100 % from the bottom all the while setting 43 all time highs year to date literally a new all time high every 3.5 days in 2021 and on track to beat the record of 77 yearly all time highs in 1995.\n\nRunning hot? Maybe a little... Or maybe the economy is just growing at a really fast pace? Looking at the ratio of market value to GDP however the markets are extended over a large margin to where they should be in relation to GDP.\n\nSo whats going on here? Are we really in an everything bubble that is going to pop and if so how can you invest so that you make money? Before we can answer these questions we need to understand what a bubble is.\n\nWhats a bubble\n\nA bubble is defined as an economic cycle characterised by a rapid increase in market value particularly of asset prices. It is commonly accepted that bubbles arise due to the psychology of investors. They can appear across single assets, asset classes or entire markets.\n\nBubble Cycles\n\nBubbles always follow more or less the same pattern as we will see when we look at some bubbles that have occurred throughout history. At first things start slow as the smart money and early adopters get in on the trade.\n\nMore and more professional investors start to pile in as the price starts to increase leading to awareness of the opportunity to rise until it breaks into the public.\n\nAs more and more people learn about the trade and jump in because of greed and fear of missing out price starts to really take off and run away from fundamental valuations. It is this stage where mass psychology gets more and more amplified feeding into itself leading to enthusiasm turning into greed and delusion as prices reach higher and higher.\n\nThe stock market is a zero-sum game the profits of one market participants are anothers losses. The more retail is buying the more profits the smart money are taking.\n\nThis then is one of the most telling signs of a bubble: retail investors coming in and pushing prices ever higher left to hold the bag when the smart money ultimately leads the market lower in taking all their profits.\n\nFamed investor Jim Chanos is warning about exactly this and just said in an interview with CNBC \u201cThe problem with getting more people, retail, involved is that it always seems to happen toward the end of every cycle. Retail wasn\u2019t there at \u201909 at the bottom. They weren\u2019t there in \u201902 after the dot-com bubble collapsed. They were certainly there at \u201999,\u201d- (Buying at the top that is) He goes on to say:\n\n\u201c(So) the problem in the last few cycles as I see it is that we get promotors and insiders and people who have done very well cashing out as retail is buying.\u201d\n\nPast bubbles and crashes\n\nLets take a look at some of these past bubbles to see how they stack up to where we are today.\n\nWhat is widely considered to be the mother of all bubbles became known in history as tulip mania. It is one of the prime examples showcasing how irrational behaviour leads to asset prices rising to unsustainable levels before they finally collapse.\n\nIn 1630 tulips which had only been introduced to Europe in the 1600's were starting to be perceived as special and rare. This prompted speculation in the tulip market shortly after leading prices to increase by 2000 % between November 1636 and February 1637 before plummeting by 99 % in May 1637. During this period of time some tulips were costing as much as a house clearly showcasing the disconnect from fundamental values and the greed and mania involved which are key characteristics of bubbles. One can't help but see the parallels in looking at prices that some digital or physical collectibles are commanding these days.\n\nCrxxptopunk and Axie Infinity are just two examples of NFT's that can cost much more than even the most lavish of mansions. The most expensive crxxpto punk so far has been sold for 8 million dollars. The most expensive NFT so far Beeple\u2019s, Everydays \u201d The First 5000 Days\u201d sold for a staggering 69 million dollars. But also many physical collectibles are commanding hefty premiums with the most expensive Pokemon card having been sold for 369.000 dollars. Almost a bargain in comparison to some NFT'S.\n\nWell to be fair though at least when the price of NFT's approaches its fair value somewhere closer to zero you will always still be the proud owner of your virtual good whereas the tulip will not only have lost its value but have withered away completely.\n\nJapan\n\nIn our modern time many speculative bubbles have been attributed to overly lax and stimulative financial policies of central banks. Japan's economic bubble of the 1980's is a prime example for this. After Japan entered a recession in 1986 the government countered with huge monetary and fiscal stimulus. The resulting free and abundend liquidity led to rampant speculation in the japanese stock and real estate market with prices increasing by 300 % between 1985 and 1989 and retail going all in. The bubble burst when the fiscal stimulus was withdrawn in 1991 ushering in what is now known as the lost decade due to slow economic growth and deflation. Today 30 years later the Japanese market is still trading below its 1991 highs.\n\nDot com bubble\n\nIn the 90s the internet was a rising star and with it many companies trying to commercialise its tremendous potential. Venture capitalists caught on early and in easy monetary conditions were throwing money at dot com startups. The public started catching on in 1995 and retail trading became more and more popular. Everybody was sure that there was nowhere but up for internet stocks no matter what they did or whether they even had revenues. In 1997 record amounts of capital flowed into the NASDAQ. New online brokers were making it more accessible for the average Joe to buy and sell shares and everybody was buying into the trade of a life time. At the height of the bubble their advertisements were showing that trading is an easy way to riches. Between 1995 and 2000 the NASDAQ rose by 500% from below 1000 to over 5000 points. When nobody was left to buy the bubble finally burst and the NASDAQ lost nearly 80%. At this point even blue-chip tech stocks like Intel were down by 80%. What followed was an extended bear market and a slow recovery. It should take until 2015 for markets to recover to previous levels.\n\nThe dot com bubble actually spawned another bubble on its own as investors fleeing stocks piled into the real estate market. This became known as the US housing bubble which in the mid 2000s collapsed leading to a worldwide economic crisis today known as the great recession.\n\nTo support the world economy during this time the central banks of the world started implementing quantitive easing basically increasing the money supply by lowering interest rates and purchasing assets in order to help the economy recover. At this point unprecedented amounts of money were newly created and injected into the economy. Shockingly this actually continued until 2018 when the US Fed started to taper its asset purchases which caused a liquidity crisis in the markets that after 10 years of a non stop FED powered rally were not prepared to come back to reality.\n\nAs we have seen these bubbles develop and burst over and over again following the same pattern. The reason for this is that financial markets like the whole bubble dynamic are entirely driven by human psychology which is best illustrated in the different phases of bubble or market cycles.\n\nWhere are we in the cycle\n\nFast forward to today.\n\nWe have been in a central bank induced bull market since we came out of the last recession in 2008. In 2020 COVID hit and as result the markets collapsed and millions of people lost their jobs as the world battled lockdowns that led to stores and factories closing.\n\nThe worlds central banks jumped in swiftly - injecting more liquidity into the system than ever before. They cut interest rates to zero and started large asset purchase programs in addition to the government relief programs handing out money to everybody.\n\nJust between March and June 2020 the money supply in the US increased by 300 % the largest spike ever. 40 % of all dollars in existence were printed within the last 12 months.\n\nThis flood of new free money quickly found its way into the stock markets since due to low interest rates lower risk assets are not yielding returns. Leaving investors no alternatives but to rotate to riskier higher yielding assets which today is known as TINA: there is no alternative.\n\nAs we have seen earlier this flood of money combined with supply chain shortages caused by Covid lead to rampant price inflation throughout different asset classes within a short amount of time. It sure looks like we are in bubble territory but where are we within the cycle?\n\nOne key characteristic of any bubble nearing its peak is the involvement of the general public or retail crowd. Therefor the degree to which retail investors play a part in the current boom cycle plays a key role in understanding where we are in the bubble. So what does the data tell us\n\nRetail participation in bubbles\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic the amount of retail brokerage accounts opened has skyrocketed. Robin Hood now has 18 million users almost doubling their amount of users before the pandemic started. They introduced fractional shares allowing you to start investing with as little as 1 dollar. Their advertising message is everybody is an investor and I guess in a bubble everybody is. The interest for trading has spiked online and offline. You know its getting sketchy when your little niece asks you for stock tips.\n\n(Infamous wallstreetbets subreddit now has 11 million members up from only 800 k two years earlier. Wallstreetbets users were already gabmling /yoloing away their life savings and at some point even started finding ways to exploit the robin hood app in order to borrow more money to risk even more. When robinhood posted on wallstreetbets and asked users to stop doing this robinhood ended up being banned from the subreddit. Sure looks like a little mania going on.)\n\nBut there is not only more retail trading the new traders are also younger and more inexperienced. A large part of todays market participants has never even seen a market correction of more than 10 % let alone a true recession. It is no surprise than that these investors are overly optimistic and can not believe the market can go anywhere but up.\n\n(It sure seems though that history is set to repeat and most of the retail crowd will be left holding the bag instead of taking home the tendies. As an old saying on wallstreet goes:\n\n&gt;\u201cA man with money meets a man with experience. The man with the experience leaves with the money, while the man with money leaves with experience.\u201d)\n\nThe only thing more telling than the growing number of retail traders is the amount of money that has been flowing into the market.\n\nOver the last 25 years global equities had inflows of 727 billion USD cumulatively. Now hold on tight because this is truly crazy. Global equity inflows for 2021 annualized amount to 1.015 trillion USD. Yes thats right trillion not billion almost 300 billion more than have been flowing into the market over the last 25 years combined coming in in just one year. Over 80 % of these flows have gone into passive funds, ALL US, ALL LARGE CAP. At the same time margin debt has risen to historic highs as well. Market participants have never been this leveraged before.\n\nThese days in the light of the FED support there is only one mantra driving the crowd: buy the tulip uhhh... dip.\n\nCrash scenario\n\nIt seems then that retail is indeed all in or at least getting pretty close. Looking at these unprecedented huge inflows into equities and the retail trading frenzy it sure looks like we are in the last cycle of the bubble but how and when is it going to pop?\n\nThere are currently many challenges ahead that might trigger a bigger correction or crash leading to these bubbles to burst. Lower vaccine efficacy and the spread of the delta variant are impacting supply chains putting more pressure on already elevated prices and slowing down the Chinese economy. The FED starting to taper into a slowing recovery might as well be a recipe for the crash that we have been waiting for.\n\nBut whatever event is going to trigger the sell off every day\u00a0margin debt is growing the resulting margin call avalanche that will ensue is getting bigger and bigger making sure that whatever correction we will see will not be a small one and might even trigger a recession.\n\nHow to profit from this\n\nIt sure seems like the central banks are running out of options and it will be very interesting to see how they respond to this.\n\nSo when is this going to pop? It is very difficult to time market tops or bottoms due to the psychological nature of market cycles. As we have seen when looking at historic bubbles they can stretch on for years before they reach their peak. As they say on wallstreet: the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\n\nIn the past the yield curve has been a great leading indicator to detect a recession ahead. Of course there is no guarantee this will be predictive again but there is a good chance since ultimately it is down to smart investor behaviour. In any case watch out for the yield curve inverting as a warning signal.\n\nNobody knows what event or chain of events will cause enough market participants to panic sell and trigger a crash. However being aware of these cycles and roughly what part of the cycle we are in allows you to manage your portfolio in a way that you can make money instead of loosing it. As promised lets look at how to do exactly that.\n\nLets assume that your portfolio is already well diversified. Now your goal is to maximise your profits and minimise your risk therefor you want to have liquidity available to buy into a crash and at the same time protect your existing portfolio from losses. There are different ways to do this but my preferred way is to keep taking profits on a regular basis on all my positions. The resulting profits are partly held in cash or liquid inflation protected assets and the other part is used to build a position that is going long volatility. The current market has very low volatility. The only way is up and there are only minute corrections to the downside that are immediately bought up. This means the VIX a measurement for volatility is trading at relatively low levels. A big correction or crash in the overall market will lead the VIX to spike up. Thus going long volatility while buying the VIX with futures, options or ETF's earns our portfolio excellent protection from the crash. If you balance the VIX position and your portfolio out correctly you can easily cover all losses with the VIX position all the while being liquid enough to buy into the crash in order to profit from the recovery that inevitably will ensue.",

The CRM stock was from the result of Slack acquisition. \n\nFor Intel, I'm waiting to see how their big.Little CPUs and ARC GPUs will perform in reviews. If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.\n\nFor Qualcomm, I'm betting that their Nuvia acquisition will allow them to move into the laptop/desktop market but it's a small bet right now. Again, I will wait for reviews of their first Nuvia product before deciding if I want to buy more because of the lag between reviews and Wallstreet reacting.\n\nSo far, I've beaten S&amp;P500 last year and this year so far.",

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/772aqq7nwno71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7319d506eb7da567c5ab1a86d4e4f1d08dc06e29\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": " \n\nTL,DR; Roman DBDR SPAC and CompoSecure inked a deal in April 2021 that seems to be overlooked: low valuation of approx. $900 million and currently profitable with over $100 million in EBITDA, historical growth, future forecasted growth has a potential to be exponential if their innovations into the crypto security space go according to plan.\n\n**First off, the SPAC team**:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Dr. Don Basile, PhD: Chairman &amp; Co-CEO of Roman DBDR SPAC  \n \\-he has over 20 years of experience in the tech industry, and has led many silicon valley tech companies through multiple funding rounds, meaning he has a lot of knowledge when it comes to valuing tech companies.\n2. Dixon Doll, Jr.: Co-CEO of Roman DBDR SPAC  \n \\-was CEO and COO in computer data memory and software management companies Violin Memory and DBM Cloud Systems, meaning he could be a valuable asset to CompoSecure.\n3. John Small: CFO of Roman DBDR SPAC  \n \\-used to be the CFO of Viggle, and has over 20 years in investment banking experience, including at Morgan Stanley.\n\n**The CompoSecure team:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Jon Wilk: CEO of CompoSecure  \n \\-was Head of Product and Chief Marketing Officer at JPMorgan Chase Consumer Bank, as well as the President of Paychoice a leading SaaS-based payroll company which was sold to Sage in 2014. \n2. Timothy Fitzsimmons: CFO of CompoSecure  \n \\-CEO of his own consulting firm called Your CFO &amp; Controller, he has been working in finance for over 30 years.\n3. Adam Lowe: Chief Innovation Officer of CompoSecure  \n \\-with a PhD and MBA from Cornell, Adam Lowe now has over 10 years in experience in the security and tech industry. He is a former group leader of the Innovation Development Team at SRC Inc. He will be leading the Arculus product launch which I will discuss further on.\n\n**What is CompoSecure &amp; What do they do?**\n\nCompoSecure is a payment technology company that is trusted by multiple blue chip customers for whom they have produced almost 100 million metal payment cards. Credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards, IDs, customer loyalty cards, you name it they make it. They have 30 patents issued and 44 pending. Thus far, clients relationships have an average tenure of 12 years, meaning this company isn\u2019t just a start up. Their customers include JPMorgan Chase, American Express, Capital One, RBC, HSBC, UBS, Amazon, Verizon, and the list goes on. The company has grown tremendously, as they now have over 675 employees and are expecting to produce 22 million metal cards this year.\n\n**A Major Catalyst on September 9th**\n\nCompoSecure is launching their Arculus card on Thursday, September 9th, marking the launch of the first metal NFC-enabled cold storage device. Arculus will allow clients to store private keys and sign transactions with an offline device, all while protecting their wallets from network-based vulnerabilities, alleviating burdens of existing solutions. Essentially, this is a hot &amp; cold crypto storage device that is tangible to its users. It uses advanced three-factor authentication security across biometric, PIN and Key card and truly air-gapped. Arculus card will be a no charging required, crypto key storage solution with encrypted NFC (\u201ctap-to-transact\u201d). Additionally, it allows clients to easily send, receive, and trade crypto assets through the mobile app. Price is approx. $100 for a card.\n\nWatch the Creator Story here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yKjEFjvNNw\n\n**What do they plan on doing in the future?**\n\nIn 2022, CompoSecure plans on adding a payment feature to their Arculus card, allowing users to tap the card to their phone to verify identity and open the Arculus Wallet app or enable transactions. By 2023, CompoSecure expects Arculus to enable eGames to accept growing list of currencies and protect accounts from hacking and loss in the quickly expanding gaming market. Another big add-on to Arculus they are expecting to launch in 2023 is a Warranty &amp; Insurance option for clients, which enables regulatory protection from loss of crypto and other digital assets &amp; facilitates processes such as IP address check, screening, &amp; Know Your Transaction (KYT) for the crypto space.\n\n**Company Financials**\n\n1) Historical Results\n\n2018A: $155 mm in sales $69 mm in EBITDA\n\n2019A: $243 mm in sales $107 mm in EBITDA\n\n2020A: $261 mm in sales $116 mm in EBITDA\n\nHistorical revenue CAGR of 29%\n\n2) Projected Results\n\n2021E: $276 mm in sales (+ $10 mm Arculus sales) $102 mm in EBITDA\n\n2022E: $316 mm in sales (+ $40 mm Arculus sales)  $105 mm in EBITDA\n\n2023E: $363 mm in sales (+ $127 mm Arculus sales) $160 mm in EBITDA\n\n2024E: $418 mm in sales (+ $429 mm Arculus sales) $274 mm in EBITDA\n\n2025E: $480 mm in sales (+ $1.09 b Arculus sales)  $586 mm in EBITDA\n\n**Okay this is fun and all but what is the deal valuing the company at? 5 billion dollars?**\n\nThe deal values the company only at $903 mm. Total common equity value of $826 mm. When adding the $380 mm in debt to the company value you get a Total Enterprise Value of $1.2 billion. The deal leave the company with $361 mm in cash on their balance sheet to funds their Arculus program, $175 mm of which is PIPE led by BlackRock &amp; Highbridge Capital Management. Further breaking down the PIPE, however, it must be noted that $130 mm of it is convertible notes, and the other $45 mm is common shares.\n\n**Risks**\n\n1) Metal Card Sales risk: with new payment features coming out all the time, it is possible that in a decade from now people no longer use cards, that all payment mechanisms are directly tied to phone, albeit not very likely given that cards are still the generally accepted means of transacting.\n\n2) Arculus Product Failure risk: CompoSecure is investing lots of money and time into this Product, and it is their main way of growing the business. That being said, if the market does not respond well to Arculus product, the company could fail to meet its projected financial results down the road.\n\n3) Dilution risk: the PIPE part of the deal is mostly convertible debt, meaning shareholder dilution is very likely upon PIPE unlock and share price appreciation.\n\nIf I am missing any risks, please let me know. Pleasure to discuss.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCompoSecure is what I call The Perfect Growth &amp; Value Play. If you only look at the business from a perspective of their current operations and forget all of the Arculus products aiming at the crypto space, the deal already then seems to be quite fair. The market cap is just under a billion, yet they are making over $100 million in EBITDA and is still expected to grow without Arculus. Now, when adding the Arculus card and its additional features to this, you are now in a value play, but exposed to pential multi bagger type of growth. Nobody knows if it will turn out actually making $1.09 billion in revenue for them by 2025, but at least there is value in the business regardless. Cheers!\n\nDisclosure: 500 shares only, I like to spread my money very thinly in high conviction plays.\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE PLEASE THANK YOU",

        "selftext": "Hello all, so I was on Reddit one day and found a post about a free geocache style/pokemon go style game which gives you free crypt0 currency no strings attached.\n\nSo I started playing it and I'm hooked. I've played a couple months and have received approximately $500-$600 US dollars (depending on the fluxuaction of the crypt0 market) and after I while I noticed I didn't even care about the crypt0 and started playing for the fun if it and gained so much knowledge along the way as you answer trivia questions and when you get it right you get free crypt0currency.\n\nSo basically you you walk around with your character on a mapped out version of the city (your city or where ever you might go) and there are keys you collect which open vaults which are everywhere..when you use a key to open the corresponding (colour) vault it opens a trivia question you answer and if answered correctly you win and get free crypt0 and resources for the game (irrelevant to the crypt0). Anyways I'm hooked and referrals do give out extra keys for me and yourself. The game just came out of beta (2 weeks ago or so) and is live for Andriod devices and there is a wait list for iOS devices as it needs to be approved by iTunes.( Which will happen very shortly).\nMy referral link is below which will bring you to the Google store where you can download game. Once you have played a little and build your Head quarters ot will give me a green key for referring you and yourself a green key for being a referee (1 green key is 10 blue keys). \nAnyways the game is amazing and I've walked and biked around more than I have in a long time. (Can also drive around) I'm hooked and I'm sure you will be too after a couple days of playing.\n\nReferral link:\n\nFree crypt0 pokemon go style game.

        "selftext": "Hello all, so I was on Reddit one day and found a post about a free geocache style/pokemon go style game which gives you free crypto currency no strings attached.\n\nSo I started playing it and I'm hooked. I've played a couple months and have received approximately $500-$600 US dollars (depending on the fluxuaction of the crypto market) and after I while I noticed I didn't even care about the crypto and started playing for the fun if it and gained so much knowledge along the way as you answer trivia questions and when you get it right you get free cryptocurrency.\n\nSo basically you you walk around with your character on a mapped out version of the city (your city or where ever you might go) and there are keys you collect which open vaults which are everywhere..when you use a key to open the corresponding (colour) vault it opens a trivia question you answer and if answered correctly you win and get free crypto and resources for the game (irrelevant to the crypto). Anyways I'm hooked and referrals do give out extra keys for me and yourself. The game just came out of beta (2 weeks ago or so) and is live for Andriod devices and there is a wait list for iOS devices as it needs to be approved by iTunes.( Which will happen very shortly).\nMy referral link is below which will bring you to the Google store where you can download game. Once you have played a little and build your Head quarters ot will give me a green key for referring you and yourself a green key for being a referee (1 green key is 10 blue keys). \nAnyways the game is amazing and I've walked and biked around more than I have in a long time. (Can also drive around) I'm hooked and I'm sure you will be too after a couple days of playing.\n\nReferral link:\n\nFree crypto pokemon go style game. Get Fit, Earn crypto gain knowledge Join me on Coin Hunt, it's awesome! https://coinhunt.gsc.im/DhDe9tEOrN\n\nThank you for your time and reading that short story. But trust me it will be worth it!",

        "selftext": "Hey guys I started trading options in June and am here to share the secret I\u2019ve discovered to remaining profitable over the long term. First a little about me. My first play was buying puts on AMC at its peak and selling them after it was announced that AMC would be issuing more shares to raise money. Unfortunately I was only able to double my money because IV was so high. Next I bought CRSR calls and 10x my money to 60k. After losing a lot back I pulled off another 10 bagger on CRSR and now I\u2019m riding a banned ticker to the moon. But there\u2019s 2 keys to being successful. Firstly, don\u2019t lose money. Use stop losses. Never hold an option beyond a 30% loss. Secondly, buy stocks that will go up, not down. Just look at the graph and predict the direction and read post\u2019s to see if it\u2019s gaining retail hype. Thanks for reading",

        "selftext": "(TSXV: SCAN) (OTCQB: LDDFF) (FRANKFURT: LD2)\n\nI have noticed Liberty Defense gaining a lot of attention recently from their flagship product, HEXWAVE, so I looked into it a bit to see if this stock is worth the hype. After looking into them, it does seem very likely that their HEXWAVE threat detection device will be a massive hit in in airports, stadiums, schools and any public venues across America.\n\n**About HEXWAVE:**\n\n* Contactless screening and threat detection system for all weapon types \u2013 metallic or non-metallic\n* Data rich and able to transmit 400,000 data points to create a 3D image that AI is able to interpret and provide clearance or no clearance\n* Throughput time is over 1000 an hour, which is unrivalled by any competitor\n* 7 years of product development and over $20M has been invested for research and testing\n\nThe product is currently in the Beta testing phase and the company has signed for beta testing agreements with Allianz Arena (2nd largest stadium in Germany), University of Wisconsin Police Department, Metro Toronto Convention Centre, and 7 other large partners. The long term goal for this product is for it to replace conventional security gates that are used at venues, schools, stadiums, places of work, government facilities and any other at-risk locations.\n\n**The Market:**\n\nThe market for security systems is an estimated $5 billion and is expected to grow at 7.2% annually. The contactless design of the HEXWAVE eliminates privacy concerns as no divestment of keys, wallets, or cell phones is required. The most recent news from Liberty Defense is a technical and marketing collaboration agreement on August 10th with Micro-X, to explore a combined technology offering with Liberty's HEXWAVE walk-through screening portal for enhanced people and passenger screening in aviation or commercial security settings. Liberty also has plans to advance airport passenger screening by solving the shoe removal problem. Liberty has exclusive licenses for two innovative solutions developed by PNNL and funded by Department of Homeland Security; high definition millimeter-wave body scanner for upgrades or new deployments and footwear screener based on proven millimeter-wave technology.\n\nI\u2019m really looking forward to the HEXWAVE product launch, set to take place in mid-2022. This product has the potential to change venue security forever and when it takes off so will SCAN!\n\nThis is not investment advice! If you are interested please look into them.",

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/labor-day-weekend-and-more-bullish)\n\n**TLDR:** stock market news sentiment remains significantly bullish for yet another week in a row, driven by optimistic monthly reports released for the month of August and continued upward trends from the SP500 and global cryptocurrency market.\n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nAs we commence our first week of Autumn 2021, stock market news remains just as bullish as it was to end the summer. News coverage this week was relatively unchanged in terms of sentiment compared to last week. Overall, the average finance article written this week scored a 0.35 in terms of sentiment (meaning that just over 1-in-3 sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically) and a 0.63 in terms of time-sense expressed (meaning that almost 2-in-3 sentences published this week were written in future tense). Here\u2019s a look at the major news events driving the continued all-time high bullish sentiment this past week:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Stocks: The major U.S. stock indexes traded in a narrow range all week, but the S&amp;P 500 managed to post a modest gain for the second week in a row.1 The NASDAQ outperformed its peers for the second consecutive week while the Dow fell slightly. Despite sustaining a mid-month decline, the S&amp;P 500 recovered to record its seventh positive month in a row, posting a return of about 3% in August. The index reached 12 record closing highs in the month versus 7 in July.\n\n\u20bf Cryptos: Much of this week\u2019s news optimism can be attributed to the continued meteoric rise in cryptocurrency prices. Global cryptocurrency market capitalization grew 11.5% this week to $2.4T dollars to cap off the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume. The majority of crypto-related headlines this week came on the back of Ethereum ($ETH) which rose more than 20% to $3,935.17 per coin this week at the time of this writing; other big crypto movers this week include Solana ($SOL) and Bitcoin ($BTC) as it eyes its first \u201cgolden cross\u201d since May 2020.\n\n\ud83e\udd85 Economy: While news optimism remains relatively high overall, time-sense fell slightly this week as a slew of monthly economic reports were released for the month of August. A private report showed that the U.S. economy recorded its 15th consecutive monthly gain in manufacturing activity in August. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index rose 0.4% to 59.9. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing activity. We also saw August\u2019s monthly job report this week. The economy generated 235,000 new jobs last month, far short of economists\u2019 expectations and trailing gains of nearly 1.1 million in July and 962,000 in June. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% in July.\n\n# 2. Most Mentioned Tickers \ud83d\udcca\n\nEach week we analyze the number of headlines written about each stock and cryptocurrency. The most mentioned tickers in this week\u2019s news and the tickers with the biggest volume increase compared to last week are shown here: [most mentioned tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d976bee-76fb-40f8-b7b7-1a97515e6ff3_1230x753.png)\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Apple ($AAPL): For the second consecutive week, $AAPL was mentioned more in news coverage than any other ticker in finance articles scraped this week. A mainstay of our weekly most-mentioned list, Apple Inc. churns news headlines, whether or not there\u2019s actually significant news to report about the company or its stock. Following the 10-year anniversary of Tim Cook\u2019s tenure as Apple CEO last week \u2014 as part of which he received $750M in $AAPL share value under the terms of his contract \u2014 headlines this week centered around an open letter written to Cook by Apple employees presenting a litany of grievances including concerns about privacy and diversity within the company. Apple also saw headlines from outside the workplace this week, as regulators from around the world mount pressure on the company\u2019s current App Store policy, accusing Apple of exerting too much control (ex. a 30% commission on in-app purchases) on developers who use it to sell products.\n\n\u201cWhat is Apple Thinking?\u201d | The New York Times\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 Automatic Data Processing Inc. ($ADP): The ticker with the biggest increase in news headlines this week compared to last week was $ADP. The stock fell a slight -0.86% last week and has now dropped nearly 3% over the past month to $207.38 per share as the company plans to go ex-dividend on September 9th. This means investors who purchase and settle shares of $ADP before this upcoming Thursday will be eligible to receive the company\u2019s $0.93 dividend payment per share, which will be paid out on October 1st. Automatic Data Processing\u2019s previous dividend payment consumed approximately 61% of the company\u2019s free cash flow last year, and while this is in the normal range for most dividend-paying organizations, analysts seem to agree that the decision bodes well for the company\u2019s long-term strategy by freeing up some space on their margins during a relatively lean period in its history as a business. Overall news sentiment for $ADP scored a +41.05% on a scale from -100% to +100%, signaling relatively bullish sentiment to boot over the past week.\n\n\u201cAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. Is About To Go Ex-Dividend, And It Pays A 1.8% Yield\u201d | Yahoo Finance\n\n# 3. Sentiment Winners and Losers \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e\n\nEach week we summarize the most extreme sentiment scores in the news for each ticker to help you decide where to focus your attention. Here\u2019s a look at which tickers scored the highest (and lowest) in terms of optimism, pessimism, speculation, and reaction expressed in this past week\u2019s news: [most optimistic and pessimistic tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ce2ff0-9cf0-4d9e-b630-893857f80eee_2181x1305.png)\n\n# Sentiment: Most Optimistic\ud83d\ude00 and Pessimistic\ud83d\ude12 Tickers\n\n\ud83d\udcf6 Motorola Solutions Inc. ($MSI): This week\u2019s most optimistic stock in news coverage was Motorola Solutions Inc. (optimism score: 58.9%). $MSI stock rose a mere 0.76% on the week to build on 46.7% growth so far in 2021. Motorola Solutions \u2014 which succeeded Motorola, Inc., following the spinoff of the mobile phone division into Motorola Mobility in 2011 \u2014 has been spoken of with relatively good cheer compared to industry competitors like Qualcomm ($QCOM) and Verizon ($VZ). Much of the optimism has come as a revelation following the company\u2019s Q2 earnings released nearly a month ago on August 5th, in which the company revealed stratospheric annual earnings per share growth of 41% compound. While some may call it an old-fashioned investment in today\u2019s age of \u201ctech-stock blue sky investing\u201d, it\u2019s hard to argue with bonafide profitability like this if you\u2019re investing for the long-term. This week\u2019s most optimistic $MSI article:\n\n\u201cHere's Why I Think Motorola Solutions Is An Interesting Stock\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n\ud83d\udc15 Shiba Inu Coin ($SHIB): This week\u2019s most pessimistic (and reactive) ticker in news coverage was Shiba Inu Coin (pessimism score: 29.3%). Even though we saw relatively low amounts of pessimism in this week\u2019s news coverage across the board, $SHIB saw more pessimism expressed in articles this week than any other ticker, as the fringe cryptocurrency reached its lowest price of the past month on Tuesday (a whopping $0.000006735 per coin \u2014 yes, that\u2019s five zeroes after the decimal) as its developers announced that they\u2019d be removing a portion of the existing $SHIB supply from circulation. Though $SHIB price rose considerably heading into the weekend and continues to trend upwards at the time of this writing, it\u2019s still down 11% in value over the past month. Keep in mind that the coin \u2014 which was created in April as a blatant meme and borderline Ponzi scheme in response to the meteoric rise in the price of Dogecoin early this year \u2014 has grown 45x in value since its inception four months ago. In other words: a $1,000 investment in Shiba Inu Coin back in April is now worth somewhere around $42,000. This week\u2019s most pessimistic $SHIB article:\n\n\u201cHow the Shiba Inu Coin Burn is Attempting to Rekindle a Meme\u2019s Magic\u201d | Fast Company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Time-Sense: Most Speculative\ud83e\udd14\u23e9 and Reactive\ud83d\ude2e\u23ee\ufe0f Tickers: \n\nimage: [most speculative and reactive tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9219e3f-a6d0-4987-8b31-8e3d32fc3bfd_2203x1315.png)\n\n\ud83d\udd0b FirstEnergy Corp. ($FE): The stock with the most speculative (ie. future-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was FirstEnergy (speculation score: 95.4%). $FE stock 2.86% this week to $39.59 to cap a 34.16% run in share price year-to-date as the energy utility company has benefited from improving electricity demand in recent months. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. retail electricity sales are likely to inch up 2.7% in 2021 after sliding 3.9% in 2020. Given the growth in demand, coupled with FirstEnergy\u2019s 96.5% earnings growth this year and given that its stock is still trading 52.8% below its estimated fair value (according to Simply Wall St.), analysts speculate that its stock is set to remain a handsome mid- to long-term investment. Analysts also cite $FE\u2019s 14% return on equity (ROE) as a reassuring sign that the company is growing in value and effectively managing investors\u2019 money. This week\u2019s most speculative $FE article:\n\n\u201cShould You Be Excited About FirstEnergy Corp.'s 14% Return On Equity?\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udc5c PVH Corp. ($PVH): The stock with the most reactive (ie. past-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was PVH Corp. (reaction score: 53.6%). $PVH stock price stair-stepped up 5.12% to $118.84 per share on Wednesday following the release of its Q2 earnings report, which beat consensus analyst earnings and laid out an upbeat outlook for the remainder of the year. The company (formerly known as Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation) is one of the world\u2019s largest clothing conglomerates and owner/licenser of brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole New York, and Michael Kors. PVH Corp announced quarterly earnings per share of $2.72 \u2014 crushing analyst estimates $1.52 \u2014 and posted revenue growth of 46% YoY to $2.31 billion as consumers begin to return to their pre-pandemic apparel shopping habits. Following the beat-and-raise report, analysts at JPMorgan and Credit Suisse both announced increased price targets for $PVH. The most reactive $PVH article this week:\n\n\u201cPVH, IBD Stock Of Day, Breaks Out As Calvin Klein Owner's Earnings Beat\u201d | Investor\u2019s Business Daily\n\n# Biggest Mood Swings and Changes \ud83c\udfad\ud83d\udd00\n\nEach week we compare the sentiment of each ticker to its sentiment from the previous week. Presented below are the tickers that saw the biggest change in each of our four sentiment metrics this week compared to last: [image](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ffb0c2-1e95-4b38-b913-cf5a9e81061e_2038x769.png)\n\n\ud83d\udcbd Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week after $AMD stock broke resistance above $109 per share early in the week; analysts at Benzinga say the stock has now settled into its second bullish pattern of the past month. On Wednesday, it was reported the U.S. Department of Energy was nearing a deal worth $500 million to purchase a supercomputer made with AMD and NVIDIA Corp.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Coinbase Inc. ($COIN) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week despite the stock rallying 8.62% to $278.44 per share. This increase in pessimism can be widely attributed to a handful of contrarian, negative articles published by the likes of the Motley Fool and SeekingAlpha arguing that the underlying volatility of digital assets makes Coinbase an inherently risky stock to invest in.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Hewlett Packard Enterprises Co. ($HPE) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last as the stock remained relatively flat over the trading period, rising just 0.06% to $15.67 per share. Much of the speculation surrounding the company\u2019s lackluster earnings report released early in the week, in which the company\u2019s continued supply chain issues showed through. Analysts wonder if HP\u2019s component supply concerns will continue.\n\n\ud83d\udc89 Moderna Inc. ($MRNA) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed after increasing in stock price by more than 13% to $416.70 per share on strong trading volume and new research released this week suggesting that the company\u2019s COVID-19 shot may offer longer-lasting protection that Pfizer\u2019s amid growing conversation about the importance (or lack thereof) of booster shots.\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis past week brought a close to the month of August and commenced the unofficial start of Fall 2021. In terms of market action, August was the 7th consecutive month of stock market growth, and the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trade volume. This past week was no exception to the tremendous momentum in both realms, and news sentiment reflected this: stock market news articles published this week saw more optimism expressed on average than any other week this year except for one (the first week of August, the height of Q2 earnings).\n\nLooking ahead into September and October, the extreme optimism is showing no signs of slowing down as Wall Street expectations for the next stock market earnings season continue to rise. Over July and August, forecasts for third-quarter earnings of companies in the S&amp;P 500 rose 3.8%, according to FactSet. That\u2019s the fourth-largest such increase during the first two months of a quarter since 2009.\n\nWhile market bulls are currently reveling in the continued outperforms of stocks, market bears may be quick to point out that we are growing more and more due for some sort of correction. The S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t suffered a 5% pullback since October 2020. The last time the index experienced such a long period without a big drop was from June 2016 to early February 2018. With that in mind, we will continue to watch the progression of international economic factors like the COVID-19 Delta variant and the transition to Taliban rule in Afghanistan for any inkling of adverse impact on the U.S. stock market. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s report; good luck this week everyone, and thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude4f",

        "selftext": "Good Morning Traders! Its another beautiful week to make some money and boy do we have a list for you! \nNow before we begin as always, I want to make sure that I say this, so no one comes after me so please read this carefully when I say if you don\u2019t have the money, or you don\u2019t want to lose money then please do not trade in the market and do not dump all your money into the stocks that are listed in this article! Just because I am writing about them does not guarantee they will go up, down or even move for that matter, the objective of this this weekly draft is to pick stocks that I think might have the best movement and potential, but with the stock market even with all the facts there is no guarantee that it will go your way. \nNow, lets get into it, to start off Adamis pharmaceuticals ($ADMP). Never heard of them? That\u2019s because they are not brother or sister to a company like Pfizer this is more like a second cousin once removed. Just trading at a low price of $1.11 you\u2019re most likely thinking why? Well, what they lack in price they make up in rumors and rumors have it that Adamis are currently in trials with an antiviral drug for upper respiratory infections such as asthma, influenza and covid-19 called tempol, they have already announced dosing patients and are on their II/III phase putting them directly under the microscope as a potential 10x if it goes that way.\nAnother unsuspecting stock is Alcoa Corp ($AA). Now ill admit this one is a bit of a no brainer, but I figured why not just be captain obvious for the people who may not always research their stocks before diving right in. The only reason I even came across this stock was because I was looking for information on Coco Cola and found that the beverage company is suffering from a shortage of cans and is having a hard time maintain the amount of aluminum. Furthermore, this isn\u2019t just in Coco Colas back door but its apparently a global issue with aluminum making it rarer and less accessible to everyone. The stock is currently trading at $47.21 and if the shortage continues its only going to drive the price of shares up. \nThis next stock you know and love, its one of the top tech companies please put your hands together for Apple Corp everyone! ($AAPL) Is pretty much the dominating giant when it comes to phones in the west and Apple have continued to deliver with the new iPhone 13. What makes this release a shocker is that apple have hinted or maybe just confirmed at this point that the new iPhones will be able to use satellite communications making it essentially the first smart satellite phone to hit the market, what\u2019s interesting is that space corporations are jumping on this and a buddy of mine even said \u201cLooks like the astronauts are all getting iPhones now.\u201d A wild statement but not something I couldn\u2019t imagine apple wanting to dominate. First earth then the universe. Apple is trading as of right now just $154.30\nStill rolling with communications next in line is apples former king the company that shaped my childhood and phone status with its beautifully designed flip phone, that\u2019s right next we have Motorola ($MSI) despite not being top shit when it comes to how cool your phone is Motorola has managed to stay afloat and prosper while not being in the spotlight. The company has shown tremendous earnings and revenue over the years and don\u2019t seem to be slowing in the growth and development department even with the uncertainty we live in today, trading at a decent $244.85 stock has taken a small dive but in the great words of capitalism buy low sell high. \nOkay, I need to come clean, I didn\u2019t want to put this in here just because of how much everyone talks about it already, but I could not pass it up. Tesla, that\u2019s right the real-life stark industries has made headlines once again thanks to the real-life Tony Stark Mr. Elon Musk. And what did Mr. Musk do? Oh, nothing just stated that Teslas shares could easily be worth $3000 a piece. Now for those of you who are saying big deal its just talk let me remind you that we are talking about a man that tweeted that Tesla\u2019s stock price was too high and by the end of the day Tesla\u2019s share price had shot down so many people were wondering if it was a crash all over again. The man literally made a crypto that was started as a joke rise to nearly .40 cents a coin when it was trading at .003 in just a few months. It may be nothing buts it\u2019s a nothing I can\u2019t ignore and that\u2019s why its on the list today. Tesla is currently trading at $733.57 a share. \nAnd there you have it the draft is over and well see what\u2019s in store for these stocks at the end of the week with the review that comes out after the market closes on Friday EST.\n\nhttps://patrioticbets.com/2021/09/07/patriotic-bets-stocks-of-the-week-aapltslamsiaaadmp/",
