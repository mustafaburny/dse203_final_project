        "selftext": "None of my friends or family care but NVDA was one of the first trades I ever made (51 shares at $68). I cashed out my original investment at 140 a share, then a bit more at 270, then again at 360 and finally sold the remaining 12 shares I had today at 400 a share.\n\nThe valuation right now is too insane for me to continue to hold. While I love the company, there is no way that they should be ranked in the top 16 companies in the S&amp;P in terms of market cap. They did 3.1B in revenue last quarter compared to intel who did 33B. I wish all my fellow NVDA holders good luck in the future, but personally believe they are priced to perfection in this market.",

        "selftext": "These past few days/weeks, we've seen some truly absurd moves in tech. Today alone, Tesla was up 10 percent, Netflix was up 8 percent, and Amazon is up about 20% the past few weeks on basically no news. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, etc. are all at or above their mid-February valuations. What spooks me is not that these equities are moving upward, but it's that they are moving upward quickly and impulsively, with few pullbacks, and leaving the rest of the market in the dust. These are not the signs of a healthy new bull market; they are the signs of rampant speculation, euphoria, and greed. These mega-cap corporations are propping up the indices and are almost acting as safe havens for investors pulling out of travel, financials, consumer staples, energy, etc. We saw this rotation in full force yesterday when the Dow ended over -1% while the Nasdaq was around +0.5%. This is not to say that I think we are on the brink of collapse--bubbles can last a lot longer than any of us think they might.\n\nFor those of you who have exposure to big tech, how are you managing it? Are you planning to ride out what seems to be a massive, unstoppable wave upward or are you slowly taking profits along the way? How will upcoming earnings impact your strategy?",

How is this valued so low?\n\nWell my coworkers and I have been trading for a long time, and this is very likely one of them. *(Computer geeks are going to love this especially).*\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$OSS, One Stop Systems, since its IPO in 2018, has been silently building a tech empire behind our backs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(*You're gonna lose your literal mind when you read the next part:*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**They are officially partnered with:** Apple, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Boeing, IBM, Lenovo, HP, Lyft, Puma, Toshiba, Thunderbolt, Universal Audio, Focusrite, and Cisco etc... These are only 15 of their 50+ major international partnerships.\n\n*(yes, this is a pennystock.)*\n\n**U.S. Military:** On top of this, OSS also has multiple million-dollar contracts with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Military, as they provide the pre-constructed systems and power required for AI intelligence, DLSS, and large scale data transfer.\n\n*(This sub goes batshit crazy when a pennystock lands even ONE of the above partnerships. They have more than 50 already in motion.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What do they do? What makes them so special?**\n\nOSS in layman\u2019s terms is a company that takes top-end processors and GPUs, and uses their PCIe gen 4.0 expansion technology to merge them into a military-grade/data center supercomputer.\n\nBut aren\u2019t there many companies that can do this? No. They are the only company in the world with a PCIe 4.0 expansion system that can support NVIDIA\u2019s top end GPU\u2019s. (*Nvidia A-100*)\n\nThis means that they own nearly 100% of the market share in Nvidia's latest PCIe GPU technology.\n\n*(PCIe gen 3.0 is the only other option, but is 50% slower than PCIe 4.0.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What else makes them so special?** Their Financials.\n\nCompare their financials to the pennystocks we always talk about on this subreddit. It\u2019s absurd. They ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY.\n\nOSS's latest 10-K showed a record $ 60 MILLION in revenue, a 57% increase YoY.\n\nSome of the biggest companies in the world like Amazon, took over 10 years to make their first dollar. \n\nOSS is only on YEAR 2 and they are only $1 MILLION away from becoming a profitable operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is this possible?** Three reasons:\n\n1. They completely dominate the high-end PCIe sector of the tech industry. I challenge you to find a single other PCIe 4.0 expansion system on the market.\n2. Their CEO David Raun has led two companies to record revenues in the PCIe and NVMe industry, and one was bought out by Broadcom.\n3. They are at the forefront of far too many industries that require this level of technology. (see below for a few examples)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey are the preferred OEM for Nvidia:\n\n[OSS Introduces the World's First and only PCIe 4.0 Expansion System for Nvidia.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oss-introduces-world-first-pcie-150010777.html)\n\n[OSS and Nvidia](https://www.onestopsystems.com/nvidia-gpus)\n\n[Official PR from NVIDIA](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/worlds-top-system-makers-unveil-nvidia-a100-powered-servers-to-accelerate-ai-data-science-and-scientific-computing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nU.S. Military Defense:\n\n[OSS Military Defense, Navy, Air, and Ground forces.](https://www.onestopsystems.com/defense)\n\n[Latest Order from U.S. Navy](https://ir.onestopsystems.com/press-releases/detail/163/oss-orders-for-new-u-s-navy-ai-threat-detection-system-top)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAI Learning, DLSS, and Self-driving vehicles:\n\n[OSS Reveals World's First Solution for AI Learning that incorporates NVIDIA GPUs and ARM-based servers.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/19/1949447/0/en/OSS-Introduces-Industry-s-First-Solution-Incorporating-NVIDIA-GPUs-with-NVLink-and-Marvell-ThunderX2-Arm-based-Servers.html)\n\n[OSS AI on the Fly](https://www.onestopsystems.com/ai-on-the-fly)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMachine Learning:[ OSS Machine Learning Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/machine-learning)\n\nMedical:[ OSS Medical Pre-built Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/medical)\n\nOil Industry:[ OSS Oil and Gas Industry Systems](https://www.onestopsystems.com/oil-and-gas)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are about a hundred more links, presentations, and conference calls that could be added to this post, but it would simply make it too long. *(We will be releasing follow up posts throughout the week to break up the information.)*\n\n$2 for a pennystock generating $60 million of revenue in its second year?\n\n$2 for a company that literally dominates an entire section of its industry?\n\n$2 for a company that is partnered with over 50+ major companies?\n\n$2 for a company that literally makes DOUBLE its ENTIRE MARKET CAP?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Vanguard increases their holdings by 103%, something's up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*(Further in-depth analysis will be posted tomorrow and throughout the week.)*\n\nA few of the topics to be covered are: product and competitor assessment, corporate presentations/conference calls, and financial breakdown.

I feel it is a responsibility to give back to the WSB community as I believe I have learned from others sharing their experience.\n\n\\#1: Pick only a few stocks to trade that you strongly believe they have a competitive edge over peers.\n\nFor me it was NVDA and COSTCO that paid off big for me. \n\n\\#2: You have to be disciplined. \n\nI bought COSTCO calls beginning of June and I actually lost about $40,000 as you can see from the dip in June. Thank God I stayed true and didn't sell. I had over 200 calls with different strike prices expiring all on 7/17/20 and I told myself I was going to hold until the June sales report.\n\n\\#3. Options trading is more luck and less analysis or acumen than stock investing. You have to time it right even if you picked winners. In the long run, I think it will be hard to continue winning. Get out while you're up.\n\n\\#4. Something I read from other posting on WSB: Don't fight the trend. The current trend is stonks only go up, brrrr. \n\nHappy gambling, poland out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n346lmy55v951.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d389fa7f62e945762ded15b1832de0ead57afd8c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zd8yu0s25v951.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66015f699411cdff8656b54701d252e6e17af189",

Earnings SZN is upon us and the time is now to bring forth our genius into the markets. I\u2019ll go through some of the volume I caught as well as unusual activity.\n\nIf you want to check out the option tool for yourself, go to [SwaggyStocks Option Flow](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices**\n\nAMD caught some momentum Thursday as the stock surged nearly 8%. Big-time call flow came through expecting the stock to be trading at about $60 by mid August. There\u2019s been an uptick in the semi\u2019s as whole (NVDA, MU, INTC) as they are forecasting solid earnings throughout the pandemic as the world goes deeper into the digital rabbit-hole.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waa6l9l0eia51.png?width=2954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c91c65e472b0cbedb5ea16ec1364461f0253788\n\n**DKNG \u2013 DraftKings**\n\nDraftkings stock price has taken a beating over the last couple weeks after reaching all-time-highs earlier in the month. I caught some call buying in August expiration as well as some leaps 2021 leaps. The stock is at short-term lows, looks like the players are expecting a bounce and the DraftKings brand to develop into one of the strongest in the SportsGambling sector.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6lfh0a4eia51.png?width=2820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7fa4b5fd9ceba04c86e6058347745f80fb3f8e\n\n**KO \u2013 Coca Cola**\n\nBig call buying in Coca Cola (KO) on Friday. 3,700 (900 OI) call contracts for July expiration and a premium paid of $550k. Another trade was in September contracts at the $47 strike price, 7.5k contract for a premium of just under $1 million. Pretty high volume for KO which typically doesn\u2019t have a lot of option flow. Pepsi Co is reporting earnings tomorrow, looks like this could be a proxy play on Pepsi where KO tries to ride some of the momentum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbbuv0c6eia51.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060882c26d52ab5fa1299180734ee53eaf836135\n\n**INTC \u2013 Intel Corporation**\n\nI caught some interesting activity in INTC on Friday. This play is expecting INTC to report strong and have a good showing into the fall. Here are the two plays I caught. A player purchased a long CALL option at $60 strike and sold the CALL at the $65 strike price, essentially opening a bull debit spread. They then sold PUTS at the $52.5 strike (currently 10% OTM) for a credit of $1.3 million. The exact same play was recognized with another 10k contracts at the same strikes and expiration (October 2020). It\u2019s possible this was all one player, or possible two firms mimicking the first play as the strikes/expiration/volume are all very similar. The players are betting that the stock will stay ABOVE $62 by October, but if the stock price stays anywhere above $52.50-$60 range their losses are limited.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoylbk3heia51.png?width=2736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f226af023a53ddf266b16f5dcc3ab3c3d7a38f0\n\n**The Banks (JPM, BAC, C)**\n\nDidn\u2019t spot anything quite unusual with the banks, other than heavy volume going to earnings (I believe all are reporting Tues-Thurs this week). Looks like most of the volume was predominately bullish sentiment, however, in reality it is quite balanced on both sides. The banks have been getting absolutely hammered throughout the Pandemic and haven\u2019t seen much recovery. This is mainly due to new fiscal policies being introduced that look like they are here to stay. Have the banks bottomed? We\u2019ll find out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ykbro4jeia51.jpg?width=3264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69dca10f7af71ff807544c27f16675fbf4311ea2",

        "selftext": "I'm going to leave out the obligatory background bit about why my two cents might be helpful.  Just dig it up in my history.\n\nThere's profit-taking and sector rotation and then there is collapse. The first is a very healthy trim of the froth that built up over the past few months. Investors are simply reallocating the profitable portions of their book to previously avoided sectors to participate in their anticipated rise.  Collapse is when everybody, and I mean everybody, sell absolutely everything, even at deep losses just to get out.\n\nRight now, we are seeing a measured and controlled trimming.  Short-term cash might move over to tradeable opportunities in the non-tech space for a few weeks, maybe even just days but the US economy is an absolute mess right now. There are truly only two smart positions, well-establish tech equity and cash. It will flow back into tech at a discount.  The same people selling are the same people buying back at a 20% discount.\n\nI've got no advice for you if you're rolling dice with P&amp;Ds, buying bankrupt companies or flipping ridiculously short-term options but if you're like most people here, buying companies because they make sense over a longer time horizon and especially in a post Covid world (if that's even possible), the next few days or weeks will not matter after a few months.\n\nSo what do I currently own?\n\n30% cash, PFE, WMT, MSFT, AMZN, AMD, NVDA, GOOG, AAPL and TSLA.  All are still substantially in the green. I've trimmed about 25% of all positions last week and move over the cash. VIX is currently at 28.  In March, it was 80.   \n\nSo folks, it's cool.

        "selftext": "  \n\nMy fellow bulls, this is my first DD which gives this a 100% chance success rate. I\u2019ll keep this short and sweet. While you guys spent $85 watching grown men hug in an island for hours, I spent my time securing tendies for you. TSM is the play to make next week and here\u2019s why:\n\nTSM $64\n\nTSM is the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker and produces for Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, and Huawei. They do more than just this but I suggest doing your own research as I promised to keep this short and sweet. They are in a great position financially and have recently reported revenue in June of 40% increase over the last year and a 28% increase from the previous month. Obviously 5G stocks have been mooning, and although TSM will not be responsible for creating the technology, they will likely be the company producing those 5G chips. On top of this, Merica\u2019s government is paying TSM to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. TSM produces chips for the U.S. F-35 jet. Setting up a plant in the U.S. will make it much easier for future productions of any military related needs, as they have less restrictions to worry about. \n\nAside from all of that, TSM has also recently agreed to the world\u2019s largest corporate green power purchase agreement. WTF does this mean? Well this purchase gives them ownership of some of the world\u2019s largest wind farms. Their goal is to be a 100% renewable energy operated company. Why the fuck does this matter? Besides it making this world a safer and healthier blah blah blah, it is a nice PR move. People love this kind of shit and it will definitely shed positive light into the company. More importantly, major companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook, are part of the RE100 (Renewable Energy 100). In the future TSM may be the supplier of this renewable energy to these major companies. \n\nAnd for those of you who care, the technicals on this are very bullish. It is not overbought nor is it oversold and the MACD crossover is signaling buy. I\u2019d say we hit at least $70 by EOW. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF](https://imgur.com/a/wc0waMF)\n\nAll the \u201cfinancial experts\u201d rate this as a great buy. Earnings will also be released 07/16 pre market. This is not an earnings play but regardless they are expected to beat their estimated earnings. I will be getting shares Monday and buying 08/28 $70c and 01/15/21 $80C. I will post proof of positions on Monday or as the kids say nowadays\u2026. BAN",

        "selftext": "Right now, there's a lot going on. We're at the start of a horrible earnings season. Tension between US and China. US Elections coming up between a crazy guy and a senile guy. So many companies are extremely overvalued. \n\nSo what do you think of the situation. Are you getting your money out? Are you spending it all and make decisions when something happens? Lowering your positions and hold a big cash position for a new crash / recession?\n\nIn my case, I was thinking about selling before elections and see how the consequences of the crisis would pay out. It's great that the Fed lends all that money, but it has to be paid off at some point as well. With lowered revenue and higher costs for adapting to the virus along with the stock market being this overvalued, I could see recession coming up.\n\nBut that would be timing the market, cause I would buy again at some point. That's why I decided to rearrange my portfolio a bit, focussing on small-mid cap companies with steady financials, active in growing sectors (web services, AI, digitalization of healthcare, fintech,...) and preferably IPO'd in the last 2 years. Those stocks wont fall that hard and would rebound pretty quick, so I'm pretty well set up  holding for the next decade.\n\nCompanies like TSLA and NVDA are very high on my watchlist, they are the future imo. But there's no way I could buy into them right now at this valuation. They would get hit way too hard if the bubble breaks. I'm kinda dividing my watchlist into two sides. The ones buying right now and the ones to buy during a crash or not buy at all cause I've missed the boat.",

It's a rapidly growing product that I believe will protect interests as Latin America develops. I believe that their development of privacy-focused serverless computing and video streaming infrastructure was what was necessary for it to experience enormous growth in the next few years.\n\n [https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/scaling-the-cloudflare-global/) \n\n\\- **Corteva - AGRICULTURE BIOTECH**\n\nCorteva is a powerfully focused agritech investment. They have deep investments in corn, which is an enormous product that will always persist in Mexico and US agriculture.\n\n [https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/strengthening) \n\n\\- **Facebook - E-COMMERCE**\n\nI believe Facebook will play a really interesting role with Canada's Shopify in Latin America. WhatsApp is enormously popular in Mexico due to Facebook's networking investments, making it cheap to use. WhatsApp is better suited for Mexico's barter style economy, while Instagram seems to serve America's ad-centric transactions better. I believe we will be seeing Facebook develop deep business support with Shopify that is easy to use for billions of people across different economies.  Some of the technology is actually faschinating, as you can purchase products and test products using filters and 1-swipe purchases.\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/business/shops](https://www.facebook.com/business/shops) \n\n**- Kansas City Southern - US-MEXICAN RAIL**\n\nKansas City Southern is an extremely important trade vector between Mexico and the US. In particular, Texas and Monterrey. It's well diversified to deliver at a cost effective rate between changes in agriculture, energy, automotive, machining, food, and more.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf\\_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/54480/000005448016000143/wf_colorkcssystemmap2015a01.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Adobe - GRAPHICS**\n\nI'm completely impressed by Adobe's growth and acquisitions across multiple sectors. I believe Adobe is a great longterm AR play as it maintains a close relationship with Apple, develops software for video games, movies, digital signatures, and e-commerce, architecture, design, and an endless array of other software solutions.\n\n [https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-acquires-allegorithmic-substance-3d-gaming/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Paypal - FINANCIAL ACCESS**\n\nPaypal is interesting in regards to US-Mexico.Paypal has always demonstrated itself as a pioneer. It's very easy to send remittance money through Xoom. It's easy to send money to your friends via Venmo. Their credit system is awfully fair, which is helpful in a nation like Mexico that's critically underbanked. \n\nThey also had an excellent acquisition with Honey. I believe they'll be generating billions through their transactions on Amazon and other industries and will force fintech to rethink how far financial technology can go.\n\n [https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:\\~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/paypal-acquires-honey-science-for-4-billion-adds-offers-deals-to-payment-network/#:~:text=Dan%20Schulman%2C%20CEO%20of%20PayPal,monthly%20active%20users%20in%20October.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Texas Instruments  - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS**\n\nI've selected for TI over AMD and Nvidia  since TI has a greater distribution. You'll find TI in automobiles, space rockets, airplanes, CNCs, school calculators, concrete producers, and so on.  Either way, AMD is listed below as a supplement to an already cloud-heavy setup.\n\n [https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/24/texas-instruments-incorporated-stock-in-4-charts.aspx) \n\n\\- **Teradyne - SYSTEMS TESTING &amp; INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION**\n\nTeradyne is part of the COVID restructure. I believe networking hardware chips are only  going to be more needed as an economic driver. Teradyne has an excellent client base regarding that and also develops and impressive amount of industrial automation robots across warehouses, farms, and so on. The future is inevitably automation, and this is my participation in that.\n\n [https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/](https://www.universal-robots.com/about-universal-robots/news-centre/teradyne-inc-acquires-universal-robots/) \n\n\\- **Microsoft - SOFTWARE AUTOMATION**\n\nI'm really excited to see Microsoft's future in software automation and services. They have a really interesting position with regards to gaming, cloud computing, and wonderful acquisitions for Github &amp; NPM and an array of other tools that can perform intensive software automation.\n\n [https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-softomotive-to-expand-low-code-robotic-process-automation-capabilities-in-microsoft-power-automate/) \n\n\\- **Costco - QUALITY CONSUMER GOODS**\n\nCostco has an excellent selection process that can be replicated across multiple cultures.

        "selftext": "Had another post today speculating on AMD.\n\nLet\u2019s do a DD.\n\nFundamentals \\*AMD &amp; INTC are essentially the only two players in the consumer CPU market globally \\*AMD is considered the \u201cconsumer friendly\u201d company as they often perform much less \u201cscummy\u201d tactics that company\u2019s such as INTC &amp; NVDA do (I don\u2019t blame them they are the market leaders in their specific sub-sector) \\*PC &amp; Console gaming on the rise - AMD DOMINATES the console gaming market. Every full-home console from 2013 (Xbox one, One S, One X, Ps4, PS4 slim, Ps4 pro) a PLUS THE ENTIRE \u201cnext-gen\u201d console market. AMD APUs have literally ZERO competition unless you consider the NVidia Tegra X1 (the custom APU in the Nintendo switch) \\*PC gaming specifically - AMD DOMINATES the multi core market. This would appeal to consumers who like to play games... but also productivity / and or streaming / and or video editing etc\n\n\\*FINAL fundamental note - You can\u2019t compare an AMD stock present against its speculative potential without mentioning both NVDA &amp; INTC\n\nLETS GET STARTED\n\n\\*Evidence - (Fine. If you insist - I\u2019ll back up my thoughts with some [Graphs](https://imgur.com/gallery/x0UiCyl))\n\nReferenced TICKERS AMD +69% on the year (lol) NVDA +145% on the year INTC +23% on the year (disappointing due to its previous trajectory)\n\nSPECULATION \\*AMDs poor relative performance to NVDA (GPU market) can directly be correlated to two things\n\n1. The lack of a high performance GPU. NONE of amds current line-up (remember we have a future generation coming but the current gen is lackluster for high performance.\n2. Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n3. Price to performance ratio is not great on their GPUs but is EXCEPTIONAL on the Ryzen platform I admit\n\nNVDA has the RTX 2000 series (we won\u2019t compare the GPUs that haven\u2019t been officially announced yet from these two companies) \u2014\u2014 \\*NVDA - how is it up so much?\n\n1. Market Leader\n2. Strong leadership under CEO Jensen Huan(probably spelled that wrong sorry I\u2019m a lazy shit sometimes)\n3. High performance and \u201cattempts\u201d at a budget GPU option.\n\nRTX 2060 super cards allow gamers to build a \u201cbeast\u201d of a PC these days for -under 1500$\n\n[Proof](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mstbPn) \\^ under penalty of permanent BAN I swear to WS gods I put that list together in under 2 minutes. THATS how easy it is to build a pc in this modern era. \u2014\u2014 And finally INTC\n\n1. Dominated the entire sector as a market leader for 7 years. See Core i \u201cgen\u201d CPUS. From sandy bridge to Kaby lake - this company was at the top.\n2. Gained momentum because AMDs FX serious sucked bro\n3. Name recognition. Has your mom heard of intel before? It\u2019s quite possibly. AMD? Less likely. \u2014- Conspiracy level speculation? Okay here it is: NVDA could be a market leader in self driving cars. This could put them in direct competition with TSLA.\n\nTLDR: So what are the plays bitch?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. I have a long position of at least 10 shares with them. I\u2019d have to check my other brokers to give an exact number.\n\nNVDA - Why aren\u2019t you buying this stock? Have you looked at the charts? I can go to war defending this company\u2019s stock price.\n\nINTC - Fuck! Before Covid this was a definite buy. If INTC continues to grow it\u2019s market share in the APU, CPU, and GPU markets this company could be fucked in 5+ years or so. Trade at your own caution - but I\u2019m BUYING.",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading JULY 8th\n \n \nJOLTs 5.4 vs. 5 Million\n \nNVAX gets $1.6B from BARDA\n \n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a very soft start in the DJIA but not so much in the NASDAQ and S&amp;P-500, with the DJIA starting off -240 and managing a rally only as far as -125 before spending several hours going sideways until the last hour of trading when the NASDAQ and S&amp;P ran out of steam and fell below the close and the selloff resumed.  It\u2019s never a good thing when and overbought index makes a new all-time high and then closes down and on the lows.  The DJIA was -396.85 (1.51%), NASDAQ -89.76 (.86%), S&amp;P 500 -34.30 (1.08%), the Russell -26.89 (1.86%) and the DJ Transports -108 (1.1%).  The internals were 3:1 down on NYSE and 2.5:1 on NASDAQ with volume on the NYSE 2:1 down also.  The DJIA was 28 down and only 2 up with WMT the big gainer +55 DP\u2019s and on the downside, BA-62, GS -55, and UNH -43DP\u2019s.  Even with the good JOLTs number, this market is just over-extended and tired.  The stat I mentioned in tonight\u2019s video about the S&amp;P is very telling, I think, with the S&amp;P only 2% off its high, the median S&amp;P stock is down 11%.  This market has simply gotten too narrow and it will correct.\n \nWe sold half of the remaining NEM 7/17 $60\u2019s bought @ 1.55 and added to last Friday @ $1.30 for an average of $1.47 triggered a 100% Up Rule sale at $2.94, and today\u2019s sale was @ $3.20. They closed today $3.20.  We also own a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .75, and we also added a spread using the NEM 8/65 / 70 calls at a $1.30 debit.\n \n\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/5afUNy48sFI\n\nOur Discord Forum link is on the video description..\n\nSECTORS: The FAANG names all finished near the lows, several like MSFT coming off a new all-time high and closing down on the day.  Not a good sign if they follow-thru to the downside tomorrow.  Also having trouble was CCL, who has had to cancel several cruises for Q4 and Q1 2021.  It closed $14.57 -1.04 (6.7%).  Add to that, the UAL report that it is giving warnings that it will be laying off \u201c10\u20192 of thousands of employees.\u201d  UAL finished $32.55 -2.66 (7.55%).  These two companies do not operate in a vacuum, so both groups are in jeopardy, again.  Novavax (NVAX) got a $1.6billion grant from BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to help it along in it\u2019s search for a workable vaccine.  The stock, up from $8 as late as the end of February had worked its way up to $85 last month and opened today $104 and traded as high as $111.77 and finished $104.56 +25.12 (31.63%).  Don\u2019t get too crazy with this one, this is not its first rodeo.  In 2015 it was trading $300 before it had a failure on a different vaccine and the stock fell to $80 before a rally and then in the week of 9/16/2016 it fell further from $169.80 to $23.20 and then on to the adjusted (1:20 reverse) low around $4.00.  We\u2019ll hope for a better outcome this time around.  Walmart was the big winner on a RECODE that said they are ready to launch Walmart +, to compete with Amazon Prime for same day grocery delivery and next day for other products.  Its move today added 55 DP\u2019s to the averages.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal since for the same money, with Prime you get streaming too.  And the margins on groceries are razor thin.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN -.67, BGS +.70, FLO -.03, CPB -.11, CAG +.54, MDLZ -.22, KHC +.22, CALM +.03, JJSF -1.43, SAFM +.54, HRL -.14, SJM +.18, PPC -.34, KR -.03, and PBJ $31.56 +.06 (.19%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB - -1.72, ABBV +.72, REGN +14.50, ISRG -9.30, GILD -.13, MYL -.43, TEVA -.29, VRTX +8.35, BHC -.59, INCY +.86, ICPT -.74, LABU +3.36, and IBB $140.15 +.71 (.51%).\n \nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.13, CGC -.40, CRON -.19, GWPH +2.93, ACB +.17, CURLF -.07, KERN -.62 and MJ $13.08 -.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -8.59, GD -3.29, TXT -1.73, NOC -7.89, BWXT -1.78, TDY \u2013 7.84, RTX -2.12 and ITA $160.32 -6.10 (3.67%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M +.03, JWN -.58, KSS -.72, DDS -.88, WMT +9.11 (7.66%), TGT -1.40, TJX -1.84, RL -2.49, UAA -.41, LULU -6.66, TPR -.51, CPRI -.18 and XRT $43.78 -.43 (.97%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL -7.40, AMZN -44.69, AAPL +1.06, FB -.91, NFLX +.69, NVDA +3.06, TSLA +9.42, BABA -2.60, BIDU -4.54, CMG -10.92, CAT -2.03, BA -8.57, DIS -.53 and XLK $106.34 -.77 (.72%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS \u2013 7.91, JPM2.52, BAC -.63, MS -1.32, C -1.53, PNC -3.15, AIG -1.36, TRV -2.45, AXP -3.48, V -3.13, and XLF $22.93 -.48 (2.05%).\n \nOIL, $40.62 -.01. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. We needed a close over the previous high close of $40.83 and while we were there, we sold off to close below that number.  The stocks were higher with XLE $36.26 -1.19 (3.18%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,809.80 +16.40. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 and half of what was left today @ $3.20, we closed $3.20 + .80 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,290 -65. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.76 - .19 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "I've been trading a strategy that I'd love to get feedback on. It has been very successful over the last 4 months but I'm afraid I may be missing something because it seems too easy so far which means it's very likely I'm doing something that is overly risky or misunderstood. I get that this is a great market but I'm trying to get honest feedback as to whether this is a dangerous or simplistic strategy in \"normal\" markets. What I'm doing:  \nSelling puts typically at only 1 or 2 week DTE at a delta of between 8 and 15 with an IV between 40 and 100. I only sell at a probability of profit +80% and a minimum of 20% annualized return- with the short duration it can be much higher. I also try to find good support levels to set my strike under and select stocks in a strong uptrend. My win rate has been over 95% as far as having to roll.  \nFor example today I sold a NVDA $380 put for this Friday for $1.00 at a -12 delta and a POP of 89%. So it seems like a solid likelihood I can make it three days without it dropping ITM.  \nWhat's wrong with this deep OOTM and very short DTE strategy? I understand many people go 20-45 days at a higher delta which just seems to a noob like me that it's a long time for something to go wrong but I might be thinking of that the wrong way. Experienced traders I respect seem to focus on 30-45 days DTE at a higher delta like 30- has that strategy been shown to have a higher expectancy? Is the use of such a short DTE overly risky?\n\n  \nThanks in advance for any guidance,",

Lack of reach to new gaming customers (everyone who really really wanted a Ryzen cpu probably has one by now)\n2. They already have the X series CPUs for those who want well binned chips / top silicon. \n3. The consumer CPU market for AMD is now showing long term potential as a profit puppy. \n\u2014\u2014\n[https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results](https://ir.amd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amd-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results)\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nAMD has a strong potential to beat Q3 expected earnings. Why? Because their production has a solid chance of recovering by then. Why? Because they have a somewhat diversified access to memory, and the raw materials needed for production.\n\n[AMD](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMD/explorer/interest_coverage)\n\nAMD - has had a rough go of it, but it\u2019s starting to recover. Yes In the consumers minds, and it\u2019s starting to show in the numbers as well.\n\nDirectly from the post linked above regarding AMD earnings\n\nQ4 2019 Results\n\n\"Revenue of $2.13 billion was up 50 percent year-over-year primarily driven by the Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue was up 18 percent compared to the prior quarter as a result of higher revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment partially offset by lower revenue in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.\"\n\n^ Clearly this is the direction the company is headed in my opinion.\n\n*What are my price targets?\n\nI fully expect AMD to hit ATH of 70$ per share by Q4 or Q1 2021. Why? Because there is demand. Look at what this stock was in feb 2019 and then look at its peak before Covid. Compare that to its current price. See what I\u2019m getting at here?\n\nHas anyone seen the MU surge? Memory is in high demand. Specially flash NVME and SSDs. \n\nWhat does this mean for AMD?\nAMD is heavily dependent on companies like micron (TSMC, Samsung, etc) GDDR6, flash memory, and VRAM are all dependent on this sector.\n\nThe amount of improvement in the memory sector -is staggering. Flash Memory is finally \u201caffordable\u201d to most mid-range computing customers. At the least - far more improvement here than simply PUMPING more GHz into the same cores and SMT that INTC always does. \n\n\n-----\nTLDR: Everyone already hopped on their **** why does this matter now... so what?\n\nAMD has a LOT of room to Grow. But this is long term. - I can\u2019t speak to how the current market trends will affect this stock in the very short term. \n\nThis is literally a power play - in my opinion - showing how they can adapt to a changing market and their literally competing with theirselves now (just like NVDA competes with itself on its own high end GPUs)",

I\u2019ve been doing a lot of reading the past few weeks and have come up with a few companies I\u2019d like to invest in. Feedback on my ideas (good idea/bad idea/etc.) and any advice in general is much appreciated. I haven\u2019t looked into anything but single companies thus far, and want to look into other ways to invest but don\u2019t know where to start, so recommendations on where to start would great. \n\nMy ideas thus far:\nVerizon \nClorox\nGeneral dynamics \nNvidia \nSquare \nAkamai\nScott\u2019s Miracle Gro\nAdvanced Micro Devices \nThermo Fisher Scientific\nLockheed Martin \nNorthrop Grumman \n\nI know these are all massive companies and represent value rather than growth investing. I do want to invest in some growth shares, but have no idea where to start. Tech, energy, and defense are my preferred industries because I have good insight into them but honestly any advice and recommendation can do nothing but help. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "Hi Folks!\n\nLong post but bear with me. I had a Motif Investing account which I opened in 2016. For those who don't know, Motif used to offer theme based investing (for instance Cloud Computing was a theme). I had a 4-5 themes and each theme had a bunch of stocks each.\n\nFast forward to this year, Motif sent me an email that they were being sold to Folio Investing and that they have a monthly fee of 19.99 per month. I used to pay a small fee on Motif for free stock advisories in different themes and free rebalancing. They also had free individual stock trading which I used instead of Robinhood. However, I decided the 20 dollar monthly fee was too much for my \\~40k portfolio in Motif. So I called Vanguard and had them initiate a rollover. I have most of the rest of my portfolio with them and very happy so far. It went well except, Vanguard doesn't do fractional shares that Motif did. So eventually Motif had to liquidate all the fractional shares before rolling over the account complete. I didn't mind that either coz I have a good chunk of Tax loss Harvesting done in March this year when shit hit the fan. \n\nNow my question is, what do I do with the individual stocks in my Vanguard account? Here are the companies I own - \n\nABB, ABBV, ABT, ADM, AFL, ALB. ALL, AMCR, AMD, AME, AMOT, AMZN, AOS, ATVI, BABA, BEN, BILI, BRKS, CGNX, CMCSA, CVX, DEO, DIS, EA, EMR, EVRI, EXPD, FTI, GLUU, GPC, HEI, HLX, IGT, IRBT, IRM, ISRG, JNJ, LEG, LMNX, MDT, MG, MITK, MSFT, NFLX, NICE, NTES, NUE, NVDA, OMCL, ON, PBCT, PH, PPG, RXN, SCPL, SE, SGMS, SNE, SOHU, T, TER, TJX, TM, TRV, TTWO, TXT, UBER, UL, V, VNE, WB, WBA, XOM, ZNGA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother piece of information - I am sitting on a gain on the total but there are certainly losers in there. I know it is a lot of information to parse through. But is there any advice on how to consolidate this? My investing philosophy has evolved and I have most of my money in low cost index funds now and would prefer to do that for this piece of my portfolio as well. Thanks for reading!\n\nTLDR: How do I consolidate a bunch of individual stocks into index funds?",

They closed today $2.81.  We also added a position in SLV 8/21 17 calls @ $ .74, and they closed $ .7\n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a decent start and rallied to a high of +210 by 9:45 but didn\u2019t hold it and was back down on the day by 11:00 but wouldn\u2019t give up, and spent all day between + / - 100 until the close when it sold off in the last 15 minutes and finished -77.91 (.30%).  The DJIA was the outcast with the NASDAQ +95.86 (.95%) at another new high, S&amp;P +15.57 (.50%), the Russell -14.05 (.97%), and the DJ Transports -19.71 (.21%) even though FDX and UPS had added 120 DJT points to the average.  Market internals were even on the NYSE while the NASDAQ was actually 9:7 Down, regardless of its new high close.  The DJIA was 20:9 down and WMT unchanged with no winners or losers moving over 20 DP\u2019s. Volume on NYSE was average but on the NAZ it was about 20% higher than yesterday.  Hong Kong and Covid-19 were the big negatives today and it was the ISM gains to 52.6, well over the 50 break-point, and the excitement of the PFE vaccine news were the big positives that helps us higher.\n \n \n \n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/dr95ohxzdjo\n\nOur Discord forum link is in the video description..\n\n\nSECTORS: The transports were the sector in the spotlight with FDX earnings (a loss) sending the stock higher by $16.44, although it closed just over its low of the day with a gain of 11.7% after being up over 14% for the biggest one-day gain since coming public in 1978.  UPS also gained 2.9% and between them they added 120 point to the average but still couldn\u2019t keep the average in positive territory.\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN -.53, BGS -.08, FLO -.11, CPB -.32, CAG +.50, MDLZ -.05, KHC -.21, CALM -.54, JJSF -2.80, SAFM -3.21, HRL -.83, SJM -.59, PPC -.15, KR -.20, and PBJ $31.06 -.17 (.54%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA was MIXED with BIIB -3.44, ABBV +1.22, REGN -15.55, ISRG +5.71, GILD -.94, MYL -.23, TEVA -.82, VRTX -3.31, BHC +.13, INCY -1.32, ICPT -1.41, LABU +.59, and IBB $137.80 +1.11 (.81%).\n \nCANNABIS: was HIGHER with TLRY -.06, CGC +.25, CRON +.05, GWPH +3.53, ACB -.18, CURLF +.06, KERN -.16, and MJ $12.98 +.11 (.85%).\n\n \nDEFENSE:  was LOWER with LMT -3.92, GD -.86, TXT -.77, NOC +.70, BWXT -.18, TDY -6.76, RTX -.01, and ITA $163.19 -1.53 (.93%)\n \n \nRETAIL: was LOWER with M -.26, JWN -.29, KSS -.63, DDS -.94, WMT -.23, TGT -.93, TJX +.64, RL -1.85, UAA -.12, LULU -2.82, TPR -.33, CPRI -.37, and XRT $43.06 +.18 (.42%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +23.95, AMZN +122.28 (4.43%), AAPL -.69, FB +10.03, NFLX +31.96, NVDA +1.49, TSLA +58.18 (5.39%), BABA +.60, BIDU +.91, CMG +17.52, CAT +.07, BA -1.85, DIS +1.45, and XLK $104.66 +.17 (.16%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -.12, JPM -.64, BAC -.44, MS -.74, C -.70, PNC -2.38, AIG -1.55, TRV -1.65, AXP -.84, V +.50, and XLF $22.94 -.20 (.86%).\n \n \nOIL, $39.82 +.55. Oil was lower in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied midday. I mentioned in last night\u2019s charts with comments section in the Weekly Strategies letter, prices are trying to work higher towards $45.00. The stocks were higher with XLE $36.93 -.92 (2.43%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,779.30 -20.60. It was a continuation rally and a new recovery high OF $1807.70  Last night I said \u201cwe\u2019ve moved $50 since the low on Friday and while the trend and momentum are positive, we may have to test 1790 to consolidate our gains.\u201d  Unfortunately, we pulled back to 1,767 instead.  We rallied a bit and finished only slightly better. We bought back the 3rd and final lot of NEM @ $58.86.  And, we also added a half position in NEM 7/17 60 calls @ $1.55, and additional 50% @ $1.30 on Friday.  We sold half on the 100% Up Rule @ $2.94 yesterday and we closed $2.81 - .49 today.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9,325 + 140. After trading back to 8985 we rallied back to close \u2013 only $5.  Since last week we have closed between 9200 \u2013 92.85 every day with narrow ranges and today was a good start to move higher.  A break over 10,000 still sends us higher. We added 350 shares of GBTC last Wednesday @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97. GBTC closed $9.77 + .17 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

I hold admittedly extreme views toward this problem and I understand people's need to debate this. Half of my life is in Mexico and it's something has been omnipresent in my life. I have seen the military police the roads, I've seen fire fights, the robbery, the vigilante justice, and so on. My parents were robbed. My mother was threatened with rape. My dog was almost killed. It's something omnipresent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I believe that all drugs should be legalized and nations like Colombia are headed in the right direction.\n\n\\- I believe the path won't be clear but a solution must come in the following decades.\n\n\\- I  believe an important element to this solution is the integration of American technology &amp; innovation that will increase the industry standards of Mexico's workforce.\n\n\\- I believe that American integration will force increases in legal and regulatory body requirements like the compliance procedures required behind and American financial technology app like Square or Paypal. The PATRIOT act is omnipresent in trade, regardless of your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other major factors at play here.\n\n\\- Advanced education in Mexico is accelerating with International partnerships.\n\n\\- The USMCA is a 1 trillion dollar trade restructuring.\n\n\\- Mexico is rapidly developing its English speaking workforce\n\n\\- Mexico is positioned to be deeply invested and coupled to American economics.\n\n\\- Trump and AMLO are cooperative (Economics of Peace).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I don't believe that the economics of the black market and drug trade will succeed in the continued suppression of the Mexican economy.

        "selftext": "Hello, new investor here, I just started back in February right before the hit when everything was at it's highs. I had about $3000 invested into individual stocks like TSLA, MSFT, NVDA, etc but I unfortunately had to sell most of those a few weeks ago to pay bills because I am currently furloughed and it took me 15 weeks to get unemployment from the state of Florida. I also have $1500 in a Fidelity Roth that is split between FZROX, FZILX, and FXNAX.. which is still down. I also bought into my ESPP this year with Hilton so I probably should of sold some of that instead of the other ones but I was hoping to hold it at least for the two years to get the tax break. Anyways, I finally got all the unemployment owed to me in lump sums so I'm going to be ok for awhile and would like to reinvest at least half of it. I'm not sure if I should just stick with my Roth right now until it's maxed out or if I would be better in individual stocks at the moment. The 1500 was in my 2019 Roth so I think I have to start fresh with my 2020 one now so not sure if that would still help to maybe dollar cost average FZROX down?\n\nAny advice/recommendations/suggestions will be greatly appreciated!",
