        "selftext": " (Discretion: First post here. Go easy on me fellow WSB. I also put a lot of \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 here but pleaseeee do your own DD if you're gonna buy $BB)\n\n**Intro:**\n\nMost people look at Blackberry (formerly known as RIM) as a dead cellphone company. A company that\u2019s basically a prehistoric dinosaur at this point with a small cybersecurity portfolio left of their business. Their inability to adapt against cell phone companies such as Apple &amp; Android vendors has caused their main revenue driver to plummet into non-existence. However, their business has been able to keep afloat in the past few years due to their competitive advantages around cybersecurity. Many government officials &amp; corporations till this day still use QNX from BB as their mobile/security platform due to these advantages.\n\n**Word on the street:**\n\nAround last year summer, word on the street was that BB is looking to partner with Amazon on a EV platform around data sensors, automation, and cybersecurity. Stock prices at the time was around $4-6 CAD. Just looking at financials alone and the amount of $ revenue they bring in compared to the industry standards, $BB stock price seemed quite undervalued in comparison. However, this made sense since $BB has failed to deliver and disappointed shareholders over the past years.\n\nWhether we\u2019d like to believe it or not -- EV (electric vehicle) is the future in the next 5 years. Whether that is one day where we run out of fossil fuel\u2026 or people moving towards environmentally friendly options, there is much to be explored and the market is relatively immature.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, every automotive company is chasing EV currently and wants to avoid becoming the next \u201cBlockbuster\u201d prehistoric company. The question we need to ask next is, \u201cDo they have the necessary tools &amp; solutions to help them transition in that journey?\u201d To answer this, I will give a quick example. Most farmers do not build a tractor to farm their crops. They instead go out and buy one than to waste precious time seeing their crops die. I believe this holds true for automotives as they lack the necessary skill sets to develop a platform that can run cybersecurity, data sensors, and automation for their cars. If you didn\u2019t know already, popular car services such as Apple\u2019s CarPlay and Google\u2019s Android Auto all already operate on top of QNX today in our cars today. Amazon\u2019s partnership will only help accelerate that movement as QNX will be linked to their public cloud to do over-the-air monitoring, upgrade, security, collision crashing assistance, autonomous driving, AI machine learning, and many many more.\n\n**What\u2019s happened recently**:\n\nWell\u2026 their partnership with Amazon came true around December. In addition to this, they\u2019ve sold off their \ud83d\udca9 cell phone patents to Huawei so they can finally focus purely on Cybersecurity and EV.\n\nIcing to the cake, they\u2019ve recently won a settlement against Facebook so they gotta pay up that $$$ to $BB which hasn\u2019t been reflected in their quarterly report yet. \n\nSpaceX, Zoom, Qualcomm, governments, and many more are working with $BB as we speak today. Sony recently just announced their partnership with $BB for their next upcoming car last week. Overall, lots of exciting news back to back.\n\nThis explains the excitement around $BB and why it\u2019s been taking off recently. I believe they will continue to do so as the EV and Cybersecurity market continues to evolve from its infancy. (With other digital \"currencies\" growing, would there be a bigger cybersecurity play for $BB? Who knows)\n\n**So.. what are the Risks:**\n\n3 things I can think of currently:\n\n1. No Revenue Growth despite all of the above\n2. EV doesn\u2019t take off as much as it should. COVID is impacting sales of cars or sales of anything in general. Self-explanatory there\n3. Someone creates a better platform over $BB\n\nThis all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.\n\n**TLDR; In Conclusion**\n\nMost boomers will avoid $BB because they think it\u2019s a cellphone company. Anyone that\u2019s googled it recently will know that this isn\u2019t true. I personally think $BB is very undervalued and with the reasons I\u2019ve explained above, I feel there\u2019s much potential for the company to grow. Lots of people are going to be selling it when there\u2019s a bit of a profit but I think the company\u2019s barely scratched it\u2019s potential.\n\nFinally, the ret\u2026.s WSB from reddit are using lingos such as \u201cto the moon\u201d and \u201cRockets \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\u201d for $BB so we all know people are dumping hard on this to make it the next big thing. \n\nLet\u2019s head to Mars bro\ud83d\udcc8 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nYours truly,\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d\ud83d\udc7d \ud83d\udef8",

Mostly interns work there but that\u2019s how they reduce cost.\n\nBlackberry is not the Blackberry you used to know before. They have a new highly profitable unit called QNX which is into developing embedded softwares for Autonomous Vehicles and EV stuff.\n\nApart from that, they are into creating security softwares for government. For example, Korean government is high paying permanent client.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough, they are going after all the companies who copied their patients. They are leaving not a single fucking company even if they copied a mere of an emoticon style. Seems like (sorta) this is now a side-income revenue model for them as they don't sue for shit. They sue for near billion amount.\n\nFor example this one, [https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/12/blackberry-awarded-815-million-in-arbitration-case-against-qualcomm.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/12/blackberry-awarded-815-million-in-arbitration-case-against-qualcomm.html)\n\nWhile I was there they won a lawsuit against Qualcomm (another billion dollar company) and won over 815 million dollars in compensation.\n\nNow, they won against Facebook. I am not sure but they sued Snapchat as well for fully copying their messaging features.\n\nI attended all the town-halls given by John Chen, and he is fucking awesome guy.\n\nIn my opinion, they are gonna crush their March Earning's calls. And, there would be a surge right after that. From all three quarterly townhalls, the April ones are generally more exciting and good news types.\n\nIt's not just some Canadian company. They have offices all over the world.\n\nThere\u2019s lot of growth potential. I am giving this boy a PT of 100$+ EOY.\n\nBuy BB. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25",

I'm Samik Chatterjee, the analyst at JPMorgan here. For the next company at the tech forum, we have the pleasure of hosting BlackBerry. BlackBerry has transformed from a smartphone manufacturer to a leading security-focused enterprise software and services provider. The BlackBerry\u2019s portfolio competes in a number of interesting markets, including cyber security, automotive software and critical event management.\n\nToday, we will be focusing more on BlackBerry's automotive software, which is QNX. It is my pleasure to introduce Steve Rai, BlackBerry's Chief Financial Officer; and John Wall, BlackBerry's Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions. And thank you both, Steve and John for attending and participating in this conference. Look forward to an interesting discussion.\n\nI will probably just start you off here, Steve, in a sense,* we- before we dive into Q&amp;A for the benefit of investors, reengaging with the BlackBerry story, who probably know BlackBerry from a smartphone days more, can we just start with a high-level overview of the business today?\n\nSteve Rai\n\nSure.* Thank you, and pleased to be here today. So, while we don't build phones anymore, we absolutely continue to leverage the strong software and security heritage of the company. Our trusted software platform, which we call Spark, can connect, secure and manage every endpoint in the IoT landscape.\n\nSo, it leverages next-gen threat protection, intelligent security, and provides a single pane of glass to manage the environment. Further, through AI and machine learning, it continues to get smarter and provides excellent return on investment. So, this area represents a $38 billion and growing addressable market.\n\nBeyond securing enterprises, our solutions also enable critical infrastructure such as securing utilities, automotive safety through QNX, which as John will speak to, and securing people through our AtHoc critical event management solution.\n\nWe've got deep credentials which have been hardened in the regulated space. At nearly all of the G20 governments and top 10 global banks as well as the top 9 automotive OEMs, we've got them as customers. Our solutions are equally applicable and provide significant value to enterprises of all sizes.\n\nSo, I believe all this and the strong financial position of the company, of course, sets us up very well to serve the markets that we\u2019re in*. And it plays right into the macro trends that we're seeing, including an ever-increasing mobile and work-from-anywhere workforce, rapid IoT proliferation, and an ever-increasing threat landscape, which, of course, the unprecedented cyberattacks of 2020 underscore, and the evolution of vehicles and smart city infrastructure that John Wall will speak to.\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\n\nQ - Samik Chatterjee\n\nSo, before I kind of move on to some of the other markets, let's kind of hit on QNX and the inbuilt software offering here. For those who are less familiar with QNX, John, maybe if you can kind of explain what it does, that would be helpful?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely, I'd love to. So, QNX has two, what I would call, foundational products. One is the real-time operating system called Neutrino, and the other is our hypervisor that provides virtualization of CPUs. Both are microkernel-based. These are deeply embedded products that are particularly suited to safety critical applications.\n\nWe've been able to reach the highest level of certifications for both those foundational products in the automotive field, medical and industrial. We've achieved ISO 26262 ASIL D and we've achieved 61508 ASIL C and -- ASIL 3, sorry, which is the highest level of safety. And that means that our products are designed for mission-critical. In automotive, in particular, that means our products are designed for things that control steering, braking, anything that controls the vehicle.\n\nSo, examples of this within automotive is obviously ADAS, which is active safety, digital cockpit, which is a new trend where we are seeing the consolidation of infotainment systems and other in-cabin functions such as digital cockpits, get consolidated to one hardware module and using our virtualization to separate safety and non-safety systems, the infotainment being non-safety. But also in other markets such as MRI scanners for medical, medical robotics, nuclear power plants, oil and gas. So, if you've ever seen a wind turbine on your travels across various parts of the world, more than likely QNX is running in those systems to control the pitch of the blade, which is very important for keeping the system stable. So, those are just a few examples.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. John, you did mention kind of the safety aspect becoming one of the key enablers here. Maybe if you can broadly hit on what are the overall trends in autos and kind of where and how are those impacting QNX's addressable market?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely. So, I mean, I think everybody is aware of the macro trends. We have connectivity. Cars are getting more connected. We have electrification and we have automation, so autonomous drive or levels towards autonomous drive. So, what we're seeing within a vehicle is software is starting to play a bigger and bigger role. There are some studies that say that by 2030, 50% of the vehicle's BOM will be electronics, and of that, 30% would be software.\n\nSo, what we're seeing as a trend is the car today is made up of a lot of what we call ECUs, and these are electronic control units. And these today are typically single function. So, you can think about it in terms of door locks is an ECU, my transmission controller is an ECU, my digital instrument cluster is an ECU, and so on and so on.\n\nSo, what we're starting to see within a car is a consolidation of these ECUs into what we call domain controllers. And domain controllers will handle multiple functions on one module. And these domain controllers are typically high-performance compute platforms. So, when you think of these, you think of Qualcomm, Samsung, NVIDIA, things that would run in your computer or things that would run in your smartphone. And this is a sweet spot for QNX, since the QNX products run on high-performance compute platforms, not on the lower end 8-bit and 16-bit single function ECUs.\n\nNow, as more of these systems migrate to these domain controllers, there's an element of safety that's required because these things are either controlling chassis, they're controlling functions within the vehicle. Outside of the infotainment, most of these modules have a safety function. So, this again is a sweet spot for QNX.\n\nWe saw this trend developing four or five years ago, maybe five* or six years ago. We saw that infotainment was moving more and more to Android, but we also saw that the car was moving towards this grouping of domain controllers. And we knew there would be an opportunity to get more in the vehicle, more software sockets within the vehicle. So, we really started focusing our efforts on safety and security knowing that as the car evolves, we have more opportunities within the vehicle to hit many more modules as opposed to just infotainment, for instance.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. You recently announced BlackBerry IVY, a co-development and co-marketing agreement with AWS. So, how is this different to what QNX is currently doing?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nActually, this is quite different from what QNX has been doing traditionally. So, we announced IVY, which is the intelligent vehicle everywhere. So, IVY is a cloud-connected and cross platform that is multi-OS, multi-cloud, in-car software that allows automakers to access a vehicle sensor data in compliance with safety and security requirements to process that data with updatable code to create new vehicle insights and then share those insights with developers through a consistent and simple in-car API mechanism.\n\nSo, essentially, what we've done here is we've looked at how do we make vehicles look common from an API perspective? How do we access vehicle data in a way that is consistent from car brand to car brand? This is a very tall order, because vehicles are still pretty bespoke as far as their electrical architectures. No two cars from different OEMs look exactly the same. They use different sensors. They have different architectural layouts.\n\nSo, the idea with IVY is to create a middleware, I would say, translator that goes into the vehicle. At the bottom end of IVY, we are talking directly to sensors within the vehicle. But then, we use either machine learning or other processing to normalize that data into what we call synthetic sensors.\n\nAnd as an example that I'd like to you look at is if you think of a smart city and you think of a smart city that wants to know the conditions of their roads during the winter, a synthetic sensor within a vehicle could be a combination of wheel, speed sensor, antilock brake sensor, temperature sensor and potential camera input. And with those four sensors, you could normalize the data into a synthetic sensor that would allow the smart city to know, do I have an icing condition? Do I have cars slipping in a certain part of my route?\n\nNow, imagine the power of this, if the way to access that data was consistent from carmaker to carmaker. So, the real power behind IVY is to make sure that we grow an ecosystem that allows scale and allows app developers to create common applications, smart cities to access common data across different car brands. And so, the idea here is to ensure that the carmakers have the best ability to monetize their data or to save money by being able to do things like analytics of how their cars are behaving on the road. The idea is to grow an ecosystem that will become a de facto standard in the industry.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nWhat is the level of commitment that it slightly* brings to this, particularly -- I mean, obviously, I'm guessing investors will be looking at what\u2019s the level of commitment of AWS to this?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nRight. So, it's a 50-50 joint development. And something I didn't stress enough in the last question, just to be clear, this is OS and cloud agnostic. No dependency on AWS cloud and no dependency on QNX. This is truly a generic piece of middleware to create this ecosystem. So, obviously, we're doing development on QNX. We expect QNX to be the high runner within the vehicle because of our dominant position in the car. I mean, this is part of the reason that AWS is very interested in working with us.\n\nWe have a very good pedigree. We're in over 175 million cars. We've been doing this. This is our bread and butter as working within the vehicle. We have exceptional record of delivery. We've never held up a start-up production, and we have very, very strong relationships with the top automakers.\n\nNow, obviously, AWS is a leading cloud provider. They're an unrivaled provider of ML tools. So, they have a lot of the data expertise to do analysis of the data to create these synthetic sensors. And first and foremost, they're a massive company that has the ability to drive an app ecosystem.\n\nFrom a commitment perspective, it's -- as I mentioned earlier, it's a 50-50 development. This type of a relationship with Amazon is very rare. They do this with customers. They don't typically do this with partners. I think, we have a very, very strong alignment on the direction of IVY with the exact same goals, and that's to drive this ecosystem and to provide an app ecosystem within the vehicle and off the vehicle that is common across OEMs and brands. And I think that is really the thread that binds us.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIf I kind of think back almost like three, four years ago, I do kind of remember some start-up companies, private companies that were trying to harmonize the data across coming from different vehicles. So, are companies already doing this? Why would IVY be different on this front?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. That's a great question, and there are lots of companies doing this. This is -- we haven't invented anything new here. Carmakers are very interested in monetizing their data. They know there's a lot of value in their data, especially as the car continues to evolve towards autonomous drive and active safety, lots of sensors within the vehicle, one of the most complex IoT endpoints. So, they know there's a lot of value in their data.\n\nI think, the challenge has been, each carmaker is creating a bespoke solution, and there's really no scale to it. And since there is no scale or very little scale, it creates I think a challenge to really get application developers out there ideating on what the next big thing could be. I think, you'd like to be able to see the ability to leverage the ecosystem from the phone. Lots of people have great ideas out there. And I think the more people that have the ability to access this ecosystem, the more great ideas the carmakers will get.\n\nI think, the other challenge with some of the bigger players in this area has been ownership of the data. So, from -- right from the beginning, BlackBerry and Amazon have made it very clear. We have no desire to own the data and we have no desire to control the data. That's solely in the hands of the OEM. And that's really not an area that we're looking to get involved. The real purpose of this collaboration is to create that de facto ecosystem that will really get the ecosystem out there, developing ideas and applications that are going to be cool for the car.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSo, I have like almost 15 questions here, and since I have 15 minutes remaining, let me start tackling some of them. So, let me start with the ones that relate to IVY. A couple of similar ones. What do you think the TAM is that IVY will open up for carmakers? And on similar lines, there is a question which is -- give me one -- yes, when do you intend to provide tangible color around the commercial opportunity that IVY represents? So, I'll let you guys tackle those two together.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSteve, do you want to take that?\n\nSteve Rai\n\nYes, I'll start. So, the first vehicles to have IVY are expected to come out in 2023. So naturally, leading up to that time, we expect to be engaged with the OEMs and potentially with Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers working on this and generating professional services revenues along the way. We're targeting a subscription or usage-based model, in other words, building a recurring revenue stream. And so, that's sort of the time frame I think to address that part of the theme.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nTwo follow-up questions on IVY and more related to automakers. So, again, I'll just combine them for everyone's benefit here. Is BlackBerry QNX or IVY going to be in the new vehicles that NVIDIA and NIO will be working on together? The second question on similar lines is IVY something Tesla will consider?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. Those are great questions. Obviously, I think, everybody -- I think, most people know we have a very strong relationship with NVIDIA as we announced a few years ago that QNX is the foundational OS of their DRIVE OS offering. I don't know that we can make any comments at the moment about specific OEMs as we made the announcement on December 1st. What I can say is the reaction by OEMs to the announcement has been overwhelming. We've already had a workshop with one OEM prior to Christmas.\n\nSo, there is a lot of excitement about the ability to create this ecosystem. When people think about the ecosystem in the past, they've thought about, well, the carmakers are going to have to get together, they're going to have to create a kind of a unified architecture for the vehicles to be able to create this ecosystem. Try to think of it kind of in terms of iOS or Android -- not iOS or Android, but something like that, but that's appropriate to the automobile. This is kind of really taking -- this is really looking to take a shortcut and really create that app ecosystem before the car makers have had the ability to necessarily unify their architectures.\n\nTo the point of Tesla, Tesla could definitely be a customer of this.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nOkay. Is it possible to implement back into the captive market of 175 million QNX current users? So, I'm guessing they are -- it's asking about IVY. So, is it -- yes, so is it possible to implement IVY back into the captive market of QNX users?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely. I mean that\u2019s -- in a lot of cases, that's the intent. There are very few carmakers that we are not working with, especially today when we look at our move towards more of safety software within more modules within the vehicle, especially when it comes to ADAS, autonomous drive, chassis control, digital cockpit. We're very dominant in the digital cockpit market. So, I believe that, that's obviously going to be the case, but I also think it's going to open up new customers. And I mean, that's a very strong reason why we made this OS independent and cloud agnostic is we wanted to address our current customers, but we also wanted to address carmakers that are not our customers that are running different operating systems or have different architectures or have different cloud solutions. We wanted this to go to our existing customers and to open up new customers.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. A ton of new questions on QNX, but before I get to that, one question that came in is the patents for sale, which kind of coincides with a news release, I think I saw saying that BlackBerry\u2019s selling to 90 patents to Huawei. And I'll just give you an opportunity to answer that question as well as comment in terms of anything that's been announced recently.\n\nSteve Rai\n\nSo, if that question is referring to what has been in the press in terms of some of the broader rumors about the portfolio, I'm not going to comment on those rumors. Regarding Huawei, there was a very small number of patents that are no longer relevant to the business. So, small sale, not part of our recurring transaction. And certainly, it was permitted under the applicable rules. So that's it.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSo, moving to QNX, let me take this one. Could you outline the content per vehicle opportunity for QNX on an EV and separately on AV? And if you don't want to give dollar per car, could you suggest the number of QNX RTOS, I apologize, I don't know the acronym and hypervisor installs for EV and AV versus internal combustion engine vehicles. So, essentially, I think, in a nutshell content for vehicle for QNX on EV and AV separately?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. I don't know that I really look at them all that separately. One has a battery manager, one has an engine controller. I think -- so I'll try to answer it more generally speaking, and then I will make a comment to EVs. So, generally speaking, the ability for QNX to be used in more places within the vehicle is what drove our decision to focus on safety.\n\nTraditionally, if you look back at where QNX was playing in automotive 10 years ago, the opportunity was typically a telematics box, an OnStar or an infotainment unit. And at the time, we were very dominant in infotainment and in telematics. If you -- so you kind of add two potential sockets there that we were fighting for, and for the most reason, those were the most -- those were the two high-performance compute platforms with telematics box and the infotainment box. I think as we see this consolidation of ECU to domain controllers, the opportunity has gone up dramatically. You have domain controllers that are handling gateway. So, you have a gateway functionality within the vehicle, you can do that almost like a router, that's going to manage safety systems and non-safety systems within the vehicle, the different buses. You have chassis controllers, you have ADAS controllers, you autonomous drive controllers. You have the digital cockpit, which is probably the first consolidation that's been happening within the vehicle, where we're taking cabin functions such as digital instrument cluster and infotainment and merging that onto one high-performance compute platform, using our hypervisor.\n\nSo, I think, without actually throwing out numbers, as far as the dollar amount, from an opportunity within the vehicle, there is definitely going from 2 or 3 opportunities to 5 or 6 or 7 opportunities within the vehicle. To us with IVY is just one more, a different function.\n\nNow, having said that, from an EV perspective, I think we put a status during earnings before Christmas that I believe we're in 19 of 25 of the top EV producers and that we have a 61% market share of working with EV customers. And one of the reasons that EV is interesting is in a lot of cases, it's clean sheet. They're starting with new architectures, and they're able to move to these new domain controller type architectures more quickly.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIs Automotive Grade Linux a strong competitive threat? Who is the most significant competitive threat in terms of the auto ecosystem? And how is QNX superior to these over time?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nRight. So, I would say that we have two groupings of competitors. We have the traditional under-the-hood safety-based operating systems. And those are Green Hills and Wind River. Green Hills is very well-known in aerospace and defense, and so is Wind River. I think, we've been quite successful against those two.\n\nAnd then, on the other side of the spectrum coming more from consumer side and coming more from high-performance compute platform, you have Linux in all forms, whether it's AGL or Ubuntu or something else. It doesn't really matter.\n\nNow, the advantage that QNX has over Linux is that those Linux distributions are not safety certified. Safety certification is a lot of work. It's very hard to achieve. It's especially hard to achieve when you look at a product like Linux that -- part of the beauty of Linux as it moves very fast, and it's contributed to by the community. But that's also -- it's Achilles\u2019 heel when it comes to safety because safety requires due diligence around safety cases, design, knowing the providence of where the software came from, a lot of testing, a lot of impact analysis.\n\nSo I mean, our view is we take all the competition seriously. And we're just trying to continue to push our product forward to be better performance and a higher level of safety against all our competitors. And we believe that will help keep us in the lead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIn the couple of minutes we have remaining, let's take a couple of questions on IVY here. First question, and I\u2019ll again kind of club them together. How will the IVY app store ecosystem be monetized? And then, a second question, can you talk about the dollar investment and the time investment, how are you splitting that as it relates to development of IVY?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nI'll answer the second piece first. As I mentioned earlier, it's a 50-50 investment by both, Amazon and BlackBerry. It's a significant investment. But, we're not providing any numbers. But, there is a significant investment in doing this.\n\nAs far as monetizing from the OEMs and the app store and how that's going to look, we're just starting to have those conversations with the OEMs. I don't know that we have a clear picture on this. Based on the discussions we've had with the OEMS, we know there's a lot of value there. And the idea of providing a more comprehensive and more standardized SDK and API across car brands is only going to make that more valuable. But, we haven't gotten into all the nuts and bolts of what this is going to look like, except that we know that the OEM is going to control the data, and it's going to control the access to the data.\n\n**Samik Chatterjee\n**\nOkay. Last one, let me squeeze this one in. Where do you see the biggest catalyst for your loyal shareholders?\n\n**Steve Rai\n**\nWell, I think, the trends that I spoke to in my opening comments are really what position -- all of the Company's technology, the way that it's come together and the drivers that we have play in very directly to these trends, and the trends being proliferation of IoT, security, all of the concepts that John described in the auto sector as well as the general embedded space. And those are things that the Company is just ideally suited for in terms of the expertise and the solutions that we have.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGreat. That's all we have time for. Steve and John, thank you both for taking the time to attend the conference. And it was a pleasure hosting you and great discussion. Thank you.\n\nSteve Rai\n\nThank you, Samik.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Not sure why this post was deleted. I didn\u2019t see anything that violated the rules. Mods any explanation? \n\nAnyways: \n\nEBON: yesterday announced plans for Q1 2020 to launch a crypo exchange, a bitcoin mining farm, continued focus on their bitcoin mining hardware (a market leader in computing power), recently acquired patent for ASICBOOST which increases efficiency of mining bitcoin by 20% which is huge in south korea and global distribution. This hasn\u2019t mooned yet and it\u2019s due for a run like BTBT. A lot of people don\u2019t know about EBON right now just like they didn\u2019t know about BTBT. It\u2019s going to be huge. A lot of people compare CAN to EBON but CAN has 150mil float (hard to move fast) and they don\u2019t have anything in the pipeline in terms of catalysts like EBON does for q1 2020. CEO is bullish and bitcoin at 28-29k is huge for them.\n\nBloomberg also released an article recently, calling them the next \u201cQualcomm of bitcoin mining hardware\u201d on December 26th. I made 4x my money on BTBT because I knew it was lagging behind mara/riot in terms of market cap to hash power.\n\nMy play now is EBON and I am extremely confident this unknown play is going to be the play for cryptocurrency. A bitcoin mining farm and crypto exchange in the pipeline is HUGE especially when they also are a market leader in terms of computing power for their bitcoin mining hardware (plus the patented exclusive rights to asicBOOST) \n\nBitmain planning to IPO at 50b and EBON has the chance to 4x or beyond just like BTBT. A lot of these plays are unknown and you just need to go in early. Don\u2019t go in the popular stocks that everyones talking about because most of the time, they just fail. We got a great stock here and we\u2019re early. Good luck to all. Bullish. BTC nearing 30k ATH hit 29600 and now around 29100-29200.",

        "selftext": "# While there are many more companies that are discussed much more than TSMC (NYSE:TSM) on here, such as Apple, AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, etc, TSMC is a hidden gem that is getting ready to take off over the next few years. Here's why:\n\nTSMC was founded in 1987 with the intent of bringing Taiwan into the global tech market. Morris Chang, who previously worked at Texas Instruments for over 30 years, is the founder and former CEO of TSMC and widely regarded as the \"godfather of computer chips\". TSMC is currently the world's largest semiconductor producer, with over half of semiconductor revenue from TSMC. Other notable competitors include GlobalFoundries (AMD used them for Zen and Zen+, switching to TSMC for Zen 2 and Zen 3), Intel, and Samsung. TSMC is a pioneer in the pure-play foundry business, meaning that they do not produce any chips for their own products. Instead, they manufacture and sell chips to companies, meaning that those who choose to source chips from TSMC do not have to build expensive silicon fabrication plants to manufacture their own chips. TSMC currently operates 10 different silicon fabs, manufacturing over 10,000 different products using over 250 distinct technologies to cater to 499 different customers in 2019.\n\nNot only is TSMC the largest semiconductor foundry, it is also a pioneer in advancing semiconductor production and performance. Currently, TSMC has 7 customers for its new 5nm chips, including Apple, for A14/X chips and ARM-based chips for Mac products, Qualcomm and MediaTek for 5G smartphone chips, AMD, for next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, Bitmain, Intel, and NVIDIA. TSMC is also currently engineering its N4 chips, built on a 4nm process node, its 3nm chips, and its 2nm chips, which will use new GAAFET (Gate All Around Field Effect Transistor) technology instead of the traditional FinFET technology.\n\n**So who are some of TSMC's biggest and most notable customers?**\n\n# Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nApple is the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization (2.17 Trillion), and has become widely popular due to its heavy and cohesive integration between its products and widespread use by many prominent figures. Currently, it offers many products such as laptops, phones, smart watches, smart TV products, fitness products, and more. It also offers many services and software products, which all integrate with each other via iCloud, continuity software such as Handoff, and more. Recently, Apple has confirmed that they are cutting support for Intel CPUs on their Mac products in a few years, meaning they will shift to using entirely Apple Silicon chips for all of their Mac products. This is in addition to Apple using their own chips for all other products that they currently produce - iPhones, iPads, smart watches, etc.\n\nApple is one of TSMC's largest customers, and that is only expected to grow as they ramp up production for their M1 and next generation ARM chips for Macs. Apple's M1 chips are a strong competitor to AMD and Intel CPUs, especially if they can scale well up to 32 and 64 cores. They are extremely efficient and consume drastically less power than x86-based CPUs (Intel and AMD CPUs), meaning that thermal requirements are much lower. Macs have typically been targeted by PC enthusiasts as an overpriced, underperforming lineup, but we may see that change as Apple's new chips perform extremely well.\n\nApple reported a yearly revenue of 274.5 billion US Dollars in 2020, roughly a 5% increase from 2019. Since Apple relies on TSMC for their chips, and Apple's Mac lineup is likely to become more popular, I would expect that TSMC's revenue from Apple will increase more than we've seen in previous years.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAMD has certainly made a huge return since Lisa Su became CEO in 2014 and the production of Ryzen, which was widely popular due to its high core counts and high price to performance compared to Intel. Now, Ryzen has developed into a strong all-around player, sporting high core counts and great single thread performance. Currently, AMD Ryzen 5000 desktop CPUs outperform Intel's current generation Comet Lake CPUs in games, which is the first time that AMD has surpassed Intel in gaming performance.\n\nAMD has slowly been regaining market share, both in the PC enthusiast side and the server side. In the past two years, AMD has doubled their server market share from 4.5% to 8%. This may not seem like much, but considering that server upgrades are not frequent and those who buy Intel server CPUs are more likely to stick with Intel, that is a massive increase. On the PC enthusiast side, AMD CPUs have accounted for 84% of CPUs sold on mindfactory.de, a German PC Retailer. This is a massive increase considering that in 2016, before the release of Ryzen, Intel accounted for roughly 75% of CPU sales on mindfactory.de.\n\nAMD launched their Zen 3 chips in 2020, which was followed by huge demand and a shortage of these CPUs. This was in part due to demand at TSMC not being able to keep up with AMD's orders. Zen 3 CPUs perform extremely well, and next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, which will be on TSMC's 5nm process, point to a shortage of fab space at TSMC.\n\n# Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nQualcomm is a semiconductor company that creates wireless technology chips, CPUs, software, and services related to wireless technology. Their most prominent products include their Snapdragon CPUs, used in phones from some of the largest smartphone companies such as Samsung, LG, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. They also produce application specific processors for things like cameras, IoT devices, kiosks, robots, and a lot more. Additionally, Qualcomm offers desktop CPUs, such as their Snapdragon 8cx. Qualcomm also produces various connectivity chips for things such as WiFi (onboard chips in laptops, desktop Wifi cards, routers, modems, etc), Bluetooth, and internet connectivity chips on smartphones.\n\nCurrently, Qualcomm relies on TSMC for the production of its Snapdragon chips. Although Samsung beat out TSMC for the production of Qualcomm's upcoming 5G chips, mobile chips accounted for 44.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue in 2020, while RF Front End chips (smartphone internet connectivity chips) accounted for just 9.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue.\n\n# NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA has been a long time customer of TSMC, dating all the way back to 1998 when NVIDIA switched over to TSMC's 350nm process for the Riva TNT. Since then, TSMC has manufactured nearly every NVIDIA chip up until RTX 3000 series, also known as Ampere. NVIDIA decided to switch to Samsung's 8N 8nm process node, likely due to financial reasons or fab capacity reasons.\n\nHowever, NVIDIA is allegedly moving back to TSMC to manufacture more Ampere GPUs using their 7nm process. There could be a few reasons for this - TSMC might have offered NVIDIA a deal, or capacity for 7nm fabs may have opened up due to large customers such as Apple and AMD shifting more focus towards TSMC's 5nm process.\n\nNVIDIA's RTX 3000 series GPUs, also known as Ampere, are a massive improvement in the GPU space compared to previous generations and just for performance in general. The RTX 3070 performs similarly to an RTX 2080ti, where the former has an MSRP of 499 USD and the latter has an MSRP of 999 USD. In addition to much greater price/performance, Ampere GPUs also heavily increase ray tracing performance so games that can take advantage of ray tracing hardware are actually playable. They are extremely popular, and currently Ampere GPUs are selling anywhere from 200 to upwards of 1500 dollars of their MSRP. NVIDIA is also huge in the AI/Computing space, teaming up with NIO for AI-based self-driving computation, Photoshop, for neural filters, and also  powers some of the fastest supercomputers in the world. In regards to AMD, NVIDIA blows the new RX 6000 series GPUs out of the water for things like streaming performance and workstation performance.\n\n# Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nWhile Intel has traditionally manufactured most of their products (Internet connectivity products, processors, chipsets, etc), Intel is reportedly shifting a fair amount of their chips to TSMC. Recently, Intel announced they would use TSMC for 7nm Xe graphics chips on their CPUs. In October of 2020, Intel CEO Bob Swan said Intel would decide by January whether it was going to expand its 7nm production, outsource it to a foundry, or both. Intel has severely underperformed in the CPU space compared to AMD, but if they decide to shift some production to TSMC, this could mean that Intel will make a strong return into the CPU space and strong entry into the GPU space.\n\n# Cool, but what does this mean?\n\nAgain, TSMC is the largest foundry, outclassing the likes of Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and other similar companies. There is an insane amount of demand for TSMC's chips, and they are extremely competitive compared to other manufacturers. TSMC has customers such as Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm, which all have great products and are only expected to grow with the release of new technology such as CPUs or 5G networking. Many of its customers are expected to have massive growth over the coming years, meaning that TSMC will reap some of those profits.\n\n# Ok, but why should I buy now?\n\nI mean, TSMC is already up over 100% over the past year, isn't it too late to buy in?\n\nWhen you consider its most important clients, all of them are going to use TSMC for future products that are important to their respective segments. Apple has just begun their venture into producing their own CPUs for Mac products, the release of DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 is right around the corner with AMD's Zen 4 processors, set to release late 2021 or 2022, Qualcomm producing next generation Snapdragon CPUs (and we may see 5G production shifted to TSMC), Intel actually producing competitive CPUs once again (which might be with TSMC), and NVIDIA continuing to dominate in the computing space and the GPU space. Considering that all of these things are happening in the next few years, TSMC is getting ready to take off.\n\nPositions: Currently holding 4/21 calls, will definitely roll calls and load up on more once we get closer to expiry",

        "selftext": "I'm trying to do some research about the current environment vs the dot-com bubble. I understand there are some major differences (such as the rate/inflation environment, the easy retail access to trading, Twitter/Reddit, high frequency MM environment, more access to financial news, etc.) but to me, the dot-com bubble is the closest I can think of to the current environment. \n\nI have a very fundamental question that no one has really given me a detailed answer for that I would be curious to see if anyone can shed some light/discussion on (especially r/investing since I know some of you are experienced enough to have traded back then and might still be holding on to CSCO jkjk). The question is why did the dot-com bubble burst and in particular, what made March 2000 special. \n\nThe answer I always get is \"valuations were overstretched...fundamentals caught up...people locked in profit\" but that was the case for 1998 and 1999 too. That was the case for January - February 2000 too. But the bubble only popped in March 2000. Why March 2000? What was special then? Did people see any signs in Jan - Feb 2000 (even in retrospect)? That's why question and any discussion would be appreciated. \n\nI'm also curious to know what the sentiment around certain stocks were (even with no Twitter/Reddit) and the volume of trading. In particular I'm interested in stocks like QCOM, CMGI, CSCO, INTC, the non-tech names like WMT and PFE which were big then (were they lumped together or did they rotate like today?), and also the great survival stories like AMZN. \n\nI also made a more technical post on r/options about this with the link below (interested in the data and also described some specific companies like comparing TSLA to QCOM of 2000), but obviously I don't want to get into that technical details here on r/investing. \n\nThanks!\n\nOptions post: https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ktuvya/anyone_have_options_data_back_during_the_dotcom/",

        "selftext": "I'm just curious to do some research to see how short dated call IV/skew/leap puts line up with some of the companies back then and how they transformed over the course of 1999-2001. \n\nIn particular, I'm interested in Qualcomm (QCOM), which to me could be considered a \"less volatile\" (ironic since it was quite volatile itself) version of Tesla. For those who don't know, QCOM was thought of the great next generation company back then, and it was actually a really, really good company. The only problem is it was about 10 years too early so it crashed along with the market. There was nothing wrong with QCOM (look at it now), and I believe Tesla will be higher in 20 years too, but the issue is if the market crashes, everything crashes and the high fliers go down the fastest, even if they are good companies. If Tesla does crash, 2000 QCOM is the closest comparison imo. \n\nI would also be interested in if anyone has options data for MSFT, CSCO, INTC, AAPL, GE, and DELL then (those would be like the MFAANGs of today), as well as some of the more stable stocks then like WMT, JNJ, PFE, and the big oil companies. Was there a constant rotation between them and tech every day like what we have now? \n\nFinally, there are the super high growth companies today like ROKU, TWLO, NET, FSLY, ZS, NIO and other EVs who have taken off today. I want to see how they compare to the super high growth companies like AMZN, CMGI, IPET, and JDSU back then (notice how some like AMZN survived but CMGI did not so not trying to be biased either way). \n\nOr in general, does anyone have any ideas/discussions on how to trade in this environment?",

        "selftext": "Clearly, we\u2019re on the cusp of a 5G revolution... and this revolution will create enormous opportunities for select companies and their shareholders.\n\nQualcomm estimates that 5G networks will generate a whopping ***$13.2 trillion*** in global sales activity by 2035.\n\nTypically, an industry measures its growth potential in the billions of dollars, not *trillions*.\n\nNo company or country can afford to ignore 5G or to lag behind constructing and utilizing it. This new network will quickly become the essential oxygen of the coming tech-based economy... and the dollars involved will be astronomical.\n\nThe company is **Nokia Corp. (NOK)**, a name that should be familiar to most folks.\n\nIn 2030, the idea of buying Nokia Corp. (NOK) stock in 2021 may seem like the most obvious investment anyone could have ever made. But in the here and now, the stock seems like nothing more than a perpetual loser... a stock market has-been.\n\nOver the last two decades, Nokia has invested a staggering $150 billion to develop advanced telecommunications technologies, including more than $5 billion last year alone. As a result of these R&amp;D investments, the company has secured a leading share of essential patents for GSM, 3G, 4G, and 5G technologies.\n\nNokia has declared more than 3,000 patent families as essential for 5G to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute.\n\nJust earlier this week, three separate news stories crossed the wires that illustrated Nokia\u2019s technological relevance and resurgence.\n\nFirst, the company announced a five-year contract extension with T-Mobile.\n\nI'm loaded up. Holding shares long. As well as **NOK January 2023 4 Call, 5 Call, and 7 Call Options**.\n\nIf this stock goes up from $4 to $30 in 3 years, I'll have a 5000% gain (on the 7 calls). I'm loaded the fuck up. Let's GOOOOOOOOOOO.",

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

        "selftext": "Why choose Qualcomm? \n\n1. Apple has picked them for their newest 5G phone\nThe modem, not the processor. Apple's processors are still competitive with Qualcomm's Snapdragons, but it's quite close.\n\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g-iphone/\n\n2. Google Pixels have been using them for years and that likely isn't going to change (at least I think so). They're also in Google's newest 5G phone.\n\nIt's possible Google could move to making their own processors to lower costs for their cell phone line, but I don't see them pulling the trigger on it. The market for processors is highly competitive and they're already joining the Video Game market which is much, MUCH bigger.\n\n3. 5G modems will be needed for EV cars. \nEVs function off a computer system to do their self driving thing. They require constant updates with big downloads. 5G will give them a significantly faster download speed and faster GPS functionality.\n\n4. Verizon (the biggest phone company in the US) requires them). Samsung makes their S20 with both Qualcomm and their own, in-house processors as well for this very reason.\n\nhttps://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s20-snapdragon-865-vs-exynos-990",

TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. \n\nNvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. \n\nQualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV\u2019s to Amazon Alexa. \n\nXilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. \n\nTexas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. \n\nThere are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. \n\nSee how many products in your life are powered by TSM. \n\nChances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.\n\nThe \u201ccloud\u201d is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. \n\nIf you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below. \n\nIf you can\u2019t then buy some fucking shares. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Just a little back story to meet the minimum legnth to post. Skip to the next paragraph if you don't care. I started trading in June 2020, after a few months I tried options, and made $3000 on AMD calls. Cool, first one really is free. I then made a string of failed TSMC and Nvidia calls, so I basically lost that three grand. Late September I was about 2k profit with more AMD calls, and then the day before I was going to close, Trump got Covid abd everyone lost their minds. Most recently I have some success with QCOM calls, and brought in about $3000. Could have been about 6k but I played it safe and pulled out too early.\n \n\n//\n\n\nAnyway, riding high on that small success, I decided I would give puts a try. I saw that Intel had an earnings call today, and in the last 2 quarters, their stock dropped about 10% immediately after. So the share price was around 58 and I wanted to be safe so I bought 10 \u00d7 01/22 $57 Put at about 100 each. Throughout the day as I saw that they were losing value, so I kept averaging down. I ended up with 72 puts, which were left worth $16 at close. I was hoping so hard that people would react the same way as they did to Intel's previous 2 earnings reports, but they sure did not. I also was justifying putting so much in because surely everyone was just buying the rumor/hype for earnings, and then the would see the news. It's not looking like it. Unless INTC drops about $5 before 4 pm tomorrow, I just wasted almost $4K. I don't think I will ever graduate from Small Street Bets... the closest I've got was about 14k. If/WHEN these puts expire worthless, I'm sitting at about 4k, and that is only because they are shares.\n\n\n//\n\n\nTLDR: I'm a retarded. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "Bottom line up front: assuming the deal goes through at the stated timeline and price point, and using conservative estimates of both companies' growth trajectories, AMD will be trading at no less than $150/share by spring 2023, representing 24% gain per year for 2.5 years, using the January 7 closing price of $95.16. If its price multiples increase to fall within the range of NVDA, QCOM, QRVO, upside is $300 to $450 per share by mid-2023 (or higher, if you want to use a more aggressive growth trajectory). \n\n \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are two assumptions in play that are by no means a done deal that are serving as the basis for my calculations. They are:\u00a0\n\n1) They will complete the deal as planned by the end of 2021, meaning they will meet unspecified pre-conditions and receive regulator approval  \n2) The all-stock purchase will be completed for the stated price of $35 billion.\u00a0\n\nIf those assumptions hold true, then the following is also true:\u00a0\n\nThe current fair market value for AMD stock, if XLNX's current market cap and outstanding shares are folded into the mix, is $100.96/share, based on today's XLNX price, or $101.14 based on the year-end $35 billion purchase price. The latter represents a 6.33% increase over the 7 January 2021 AMD closing price of $95.16/share. This is only based on up-to-date market cap figures and most-recent-quarter earnings figures, which are a good three months out of date at this point.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, in the press releases and earnings calls where the CEOs discussed the merger, one of the points that came out was that the companies have a lot of overlap when it comes to their business operations and R&amp;D. Within 18 months of the merger, or late spring 2023, that means they will be able to [cut $300 million in annual expenses](https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/components-peripherals/the-35b-amd-xilinx-acquisition-7-big-things-to-know/2), simply through synergy of eliminating functional overlap. Given the following from the most recent quarterly reports, covering 3 months of operations ending 26 Sep 2020:\u00a0\n\n1) XLNX net earnings were $193.8m, or $775.2m annualized  \n2) AMD net earnings were $390m, or $1.56b annualized  \n3) Combined earnings are $2.33b\n\nThat means that net earnings will be increased by 13%, just in cutting overlapping expenses. That means that, assuming today's earnings and today's share prices, and combining the financials of both companies, the fair market value for AMD as of early- to mid-2023 is $114, based on annualized earnings numbers that are already three months old.\u00a0\n\nUsing conservative extrapolation of recent growth trajectories, and using today's price multiples\\*, it's conservative to estimate that AMD will be trading for $150/share by June 2023. Based on the current share price of 95.12, that's an annualized growth of 23.96%.\u00a0\n\n\\*If for whatever reason there's a market downturn in this time, AMD's performance could live up to these numbers, but the price multiples could decrease. This represents nearly all remaining risk of inaccuracy, outside the stated assumptions.\n\nPlease fire away at this. Poke your holes and make your arguments. I'm getting ready to heavily shift my portfolio's center of gravity into AMD based on all this, so if any of you know a good reason not to, I'd love to hear it.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, January 6, 2020**\n\nAfter climbing throughout the day, stocks pulled back in the last few hours of the session as turmoil in Washington D.C. escalated. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.56% up, the Dow Jones (DIA) 1.43% up, and the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.39% down.\n\nToday, as lawmakers debated President-Elect Biden\u2019s election victory, protesters in support of Donald Trump broke through the barricades and flooded the Capitol Building. In response, the building was placed under lockdown and Trump deployed the national guard and other law enforcement agencies to control the chaos. According to the Associated Press, one person was shot in a violent clash with the police. The unnamed person was rushed to the hospital, though their condition is not known. Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a city-wide curfew from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m.\n\nIn Georgia, Democratic Raphel Warnock defeated incumbent Kelly Koeffler to win one of the two Senate seats in the state. This gives Democrats 49 seats to the Republicans 50, with one seat still hanging in the balance. The race between incumbent Republican David Perdue and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff remains too close to call at the time of writing and will decide which party has the majority position. Remember, in the case of a 50/50 tie, the Vice-President (Kamala Harris after January 20) casts the tie-breaking vote. \n\nAs of Monday morning, the first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine had been given to more than 4.5 million people in the U.S., far below the Trump Administration promise of vaccinating 20 million Americans by years-end. Dr. Anthony Fauci said President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s goal of ramping up distribution to vaccinate 100 million people in his first 100 days was a \u201crealistic goal,\u201d according to an interview with ABC on Sunday. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The New York Stock Exchange announced it would delist three Chinese telecommunication companies in an effort to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order from November banning U.S. investment in companies that were said to support China\u2019s military. The companies are: China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom\n* European Union\u2019s drug regulators approved Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, making it the second available in the bloc\n* U.S. officials are considering delisting Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) from the stock market, according people familiar with the matter.

        "selftext": "EBON: yesterday announced plans for Q1 2020 to launch a crypo exchange, a bitcoin mining farm, continued focus on their bitcoin mining hardware (a market leader in computing power), recently acquired patent for ASICBOOST which increases efficiency of mining bitcoin by 20% which is huge in south korea and global distribution. This hasn\u2019t mooned yet and it\u2019s due for a run like BTBT. A lot of people don\u2019t know about EBON right now just like they didn\u2019t know about BTBT. It\u2019s going to be huge. A lot of people compare CAN to EBON but CAN has 150mil float (hard to move fast) and they don\u2019t have anything in the pipeline in terms of catalysts like EBON does for q1 2020. CEO is bullish and bitcoin at 28-29k is huge for them.\n\nBloomberg also released an article recently, calling them the next \u201cQualcomm of bitcoin mining hardware\u201d on December 26th. I made 4x my money on BTBT because I knew it was lagging behind mara/riot in terms of hash power.\n\nMy play now is EBON and I am extremely confident this unknown play is going to be the play for cryptocurrency. A bitcoin mining farm and crypto exchange in the pipeline is HUGE especially when they also are a market leader in terms of computing power for their bitcoin mining hardware (plus the patented exclusive rights to asicBOOST) \n\nBitmain planning to IPO at 50b and EBON has the chance to 4x just like BTBT. A lot of these plays are unknown and you just need to go in early. Don\u2019t go in the popular stocks that everyones talking about because most of the time, they just fail. We got a great stock here and we\u2019re early. Good luck to all. Bullish.",

The company generates revenue from three service offerings: non- surgical aesthetic medical services, comprising minimally invasive aesthetic treatments and energy-based treatments; surgical aesthetic medical services, and general healthcare services and other aesthetic medical services. Most of the firm's revenue gets derived from Non-surgical aesthetic medical services. Geographically, it derives revenue from China.    \n\n\nAIH has been on a consistent downward trend since the pandemic began, with a brief run-up back in October from a low of $3.80 to a high of $7.71. We have formed a loose falling wedge on the daily chart, and on Thursday we closed just above our resistance zone, and above the previous volume shelf. Fantastic accumulation volume over the last few trading days, I'm looking for continuation going into the first trading week of 2021.   \n\n\n*Processing img ihkhnpc6cb961...*\n\n***$SNDL:***    \n\n\nSundial Growers, and many other cannabis names, have been on a gradual uptrend since the recent legalization / decriminalization legislation that was passed throughout the United States during election time.     \n\n\nWhat I find incredibly interesting about this sector is that they move incredibly similar to one another. TLRY is a close comparison to the SNDL chart below.    \n\n\nSNDL has had some immense price swings of over 100% in the last few weeks, so its important you set your stops.    \n\n\nCurrently on the daily chart, Sndl is riding just above our multi-month support zone. On Monday, I will be looking for the stock to open $.47 before entry, which we are seeing with a pre-market gap up. I have a position. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img x4tc2q5ccb961...*\n\n***$SQFT:***    \n\n\n03:07 AM EST, 12/30/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Presidio Property Trust (SQFT) on Tuesday filed a registration statement covering the potential sale of up to $200 million in securities.   \n\n\nThe securities, which may be offered from time to time, include series A common shares, preferred shares, purchase contracts, warrants, subscription rights, depositary shares, debt securities, and units, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.    \n\n\nThis can be both good news and bad news. The good news is, the company is expecting another large upward move like we saw in the end of December. The BAD news is that if this stock DOES run again, the odds of them using their shelf offering are high.    \n\n\nChart wise, SQFT is primed to run. We are currently testing our resistance zone on the 65 minute chart this pre-market, and are inching are way upward to the next vol. shelf. If I can pick up some shares at open around $4.24, I'm looking to swing this into the mid $6's.    \n\n\n*DISCLAIMER: Low Vol. Mover*   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4hdu0sfcb961.png?width=2252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a18f9ca0488aa34a4287479614c054518801391\n\n**\ud83d\udd35Blue Chip Chart Setups of the Day\ud83d\udd35**  \n\n\n***$QCOM:***\n\n*Processing img qyw4cssjcb961...*\n\n***$SYK:***\n\n*Processing img j17z06hlcb961...*\n\n***$TUP:***\n\n*Processing img 2lr4jqpncb961...*\n\n***$CVS:***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/muhs3o6tcb961.png?width=2252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bce7a23984f07562960802b672be6a8940460583\n\n***$ORLY:***\n\n*Processing img jm1cd1vvcb961...*\n\n***$LHX:***\n\n*Processing img k6mdb7iycb961...*\n\n***$FDX:***\n\n*Processing img nxuosan0db961...*\n\n*Happy first Monday of 2021!

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

Still, considering rivals like qcom, mu, avgo, and tsmc, Marvell's in it's infancy with a market cap one-third the size of the smallest of the others I listed. \n\nbroadcom, for example, seems to be focusing on 5G rollout as one of their bigger growth streams, and Marvell is doing the same. Assuming they both see comparable revenue from exposure to that industry, shouldn't that result in a larger % of growth overall for marvell?\n\nOr, is there a reason to think that the already established competitors will be able to keep marvell's growth locked down due to their already substantial market share in most existing markets?",

        "selftext": "I'm convinced that Apple is going to completely blow away their earnings expectations on 12/27 for 4 different reasons, which I will go through in this post, but first, I've gotta give some background on how I can speculate on all of this. \n\n**Background:** I am a co-host of the YouTube channel Max Tech which has a heavy focus on covering Apple products. I used to make videos for the channel Appleinsider, so I started working and studying everything Apple way back in September of 2016 when I made my first Apple-related videos. Over the past 4 and a half years, I've never seen this much attention, hype, and excitement over new Apple products, as I'll get into in a moment.  \n\n\nBefore we begin: Apple forecasted to have record revenue of over $100 billion: [https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/apple-q1-2021-earnings-preview/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/apple-q1-2021-earnings-preview/)  \nMorgan Stanley raised the price target once again to $152: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/apple-stock-price-target-record-q1-earnings-iphone-sales-aapl-2021-1-1029991412#:\\~:text=Morgan%20Stanley%20raised%20its%20price,record%20quarterly%20profits%20and%20revenue](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/apple-stock-price-target-record-q1-earnings-iphone-sales-aapl-2021-1-1029991412#:~:text=Morgan%20Stanley%20raised%20its%20price,record%20quarterly%20profits%20and%20revenue).\n\nI will be linking to many articles below and giving a short TLDR on why it's so bullish. I will also include my own experience and bullish sentiment I've noticed over the past couple of months. \n\n  \n**Reason #1:**   \nApple's iPhone 12 lineup is getting incredible amounts of demand due mostly to the new flat-edged design and other features like MagSafe and camera software improvements. There have been many reports of record sales growth in China, and US sales being so good that Apple has increased production of the iPhone 12 due to demand.  \n\n\nI've personally really enjoyed the iPhone 12 and I think it feels like a totally different phone due to the new design. We've been getting massive amounts of views on iPhone 12 videos on the channel, definitely noticing more demand.   \n\n\nVery high iPhone 12 Pro demand: [https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/production-shifting-from-iphone-12-mini-to-pro/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/production-shifting-from-iphone-12-mini-to-pro/)  \nWhile most companies declined in terms of smartphone shipments this year, Apple gained: [https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/13/iphone-shipments-up-10-percent-2020/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/13/iphone-shipments-up-10-percent-2020/)  \nApple gained a massive amount of market share in China very recently: [https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/12/iphone-12-sales-china-18-million-units-q4-2020/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/12/iphone-12-sales-china-18-million-units-q4-2020/)  \n9/10 smartphone activated on Christmas day in US were iPhones: [https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/29/9-of-top-10-smartphones-on-christmas-day-iphones/](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/29/9-of-top-10-smartphones-on-christmas-day-iphones/)  \niPhone 12 is the world's best selling 5G phone: [https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/21/iphone-12-became-the-worlds-top-5g-smartphone/](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/21/iphone-12-became-the-worlds-top-5g-smartphone/)  \niPhone 12 demand helped Qualcomm revenue: [https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/18/apple-working-on-high-end-mmwave-modem/](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/18/apple-working-on-high-end-mmwave-modem/)  \nApple boosts iPhone 12 orders by 30% following strong demand: [https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/15/apple-boosts-iphone-orders-2021/](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/15/apple-boosts-iphone-orders-2021/)\n\n  \n**Reason #2: Services growth and gaming growth while people are on lockdown.**  \n\n\nServices growth has been going up, but recent reports are showing record-breaking Services growth. Apple has also recently launched their Apple One Service bundles which should boost revenue. Gaming revenue should reach all-time highs, especially due to the lockdowns and many people staying home. \n\nMassive services growth this year: [https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/app-store-sales-saw-unprecedented-growth-in-2020/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/app-store-sales-saw-unprecedented-growth-in-2020/)  \nApp store record on New Year's Day: [https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/apple-services-in-2020-as-app-store-sets-record/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/apple-services-in-2020-as-app-store-sets-record/)  \n30% increase in App Store spending compared to last year: [https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/app-store-spending-72-billion-2020/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/app-store-spending-72-billion-2020/)  \nStudy finds more than $100 billion spent on app store in 2020: [https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/30/more-than-100-billion-spent-on-app-stores-2020/](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/30/more-than-100-billion-spent-on-app-stores-2020/)  \nPrice target raised on news of Apple One service bundle (already released): [https://www.applemust.com/needham-raises-apple-target-on-strength-of-apple-one/](https://www.applemust.com/needham-raises-apple-target-on-strength-of-apple-one/)\n\nApple planning on creating more Service subscriptions: [https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/new-apple-services-include-podcasts-stocks-mail/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/new-apple-services-include-podcasts-stocks-mail/)\n\n  \n**Reason #3: Apple's first Macs with their own custom Apple Silicon chips are revolutionizing the computer industry. Huge spike in views on our channel. Record-breaking mac sales recently. We've had a noticeable spike in affiliate link sales for these M1 Macs.**   \n\n\nThese new Macs have literally skyrocketed the views on our channel. We've never seen this much interest in Macs before.   \n\n\n**Image below:** Spike in youtube channel views thanks to massive interest in M1 Mac release. \n\n[New M1 Macs led to the highest spike in views we've ever had.](https://preview.redd.it/3mhru6jbd2d61.png?width=1294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a45436d39bc5e71d30b8193c3df85961a3bb521d)\n\nIt makes sense because of how powerful they are while having completely game-changing battery life at the same time due to using the new Apple Silicon architecture that came directly from their iPhones and iPads. \n\nThese new Macs are revolutionizing the entire personal computing industry, and it's only beginning. We've never seen so many Windows users switching to the Mac only because of these new M1 Macs. \n\nDon't believe me, check out our video on how the new $899 M1 Mac mini compares to the previous $2999 fully-loaded Intel Mac Mini: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59gAjXT7qyw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59gAjXT7qyw) \n\nI believe that Apple is disrupting the entire computing industry, causing other manufacturers to make a huge push for Arm-based chips. Microsoft and Qualcomm already announced new chips for laptop makers. We should expect record-breaking Mac sales.   \n\n\nBetter than expected performance: [https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition)\n\nM1 chip in $999 MacBook Air compiles code faster than $5999 Mac Pro: [https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/17/apple-silicon-m1-compiles-code-as-fast-as-mac-pro/](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/17/apple-silicon-m1-compiles-code-as-fast-as-mac-pro/)\n\nComputing revolution: [https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/macbook-air-2020-m1](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/macbook-air-2020-m1)\n\n[https://medium.com/@LanceUlanoff/apple-m1-silicon-is-the-soc-tipping-point-d24f7897588](https://medium.com/@LanceUlanoff/apple-m1-silicon-is-the-soc-tipping-point-d24f7897588)  \n[https://www.macobserver.com/cool-stuff-found/apples-m1-chip-leading-revolution/](https://www.macobserver.com/cool-stuff-found/apples-m1-chip-leading-revolution/)  \n\n\nMany long-time Windows users switching to Mac Thanks to M1:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/jxznjx/long\\_time\\_windows\\_user\\_switching\\_to\\_m1\\_macbook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/jxznjx/long_time_windows_user_switching_to_m1_macbook/)  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/macmini/comments/jvmbex/switching\\_from\\_windows\\_to\\_m1\\_mini/](https://www.reddit.com/r/macmini/comments/jvmbex/switching_from_windows_to_m1_mini/)  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/kw9184/lifelong\\_windows\\_user\\_making\\_the\\_switch\\_to\\_apple/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/kw9184/lifelong_windows_user_making_the_switch_to_apple/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/k2ksu4/buying\\_my\\_first\\_macbook\\_m1\\_air\\_after\\_using/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/k2ksu4/buying_my_first_macbook_m1_air_after_using/)\n\nMassive growth in Mac sales in Q4: [https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/mac-shipments-up-4q-2020-gartner/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/mac-shipments-up-4q-2020-gartner/)\n\nM1 Mac Mini boosted Japan Mac desktop PC market share from 15% to 27.1% (MASSIVE): [https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/30/m1-mac-mini-catapulted-apple-to-number-one-in-japanese-desktop-pc-market#:\\~:text=The%20new%20M1%2Dequipped%20Mac,online%20stores%20in%20the%20country](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/30/m1-mac-mini-catapulted-apple-to-number-one-in-japanese-desktop-pc-market#:~:text=The%20new%20M1%2Dequipped%20Mac,online%20stores%20in%20the%20country)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reason #4: Future forecast to be very strong due to greatly increased Mac sales and iPad Pro sales (coming in March) due to new Mini-LED display tech coming this year and new Apple Silicon Mac models.** \n\n**On top of that, $600 stimulus checks have already gone out. Potential for extra $1400 checks to go out. This will increase the forecast for the next quarter.

If there is a huge run-up this week, which I think there will be, sell before the market closes on Wednesday to avoid IV crush (only for options). If it stays flat or dips, hold through earnings. If the entire market starts to crash, you should be selling because Apple very closely follows the S&amp;P 500 and drops if there's high volatility, even when they destroy expectations. \n\nPosition: $AAPL 135c 2/19  \nMost likely buying in with shares on Monday.  \nObligatory [\ud83d\ude80](https://emojis.wiki/rocket/#:~:text=Meaning%20of%20%F0%9F%9A%80%20Rocket%20Emoji,user%20is%20determined%20to%20fulfill.)[\ud83d\ude80](https://emojis.wiki/rocket/#:~:text=Meaning%20of%20%F0%9F%9A%80%20Rocket%20Emoji,user%20is%20determined%20to%20fulfill.)[\ud83d\ude80](https://emojis.wiki/rocket/#:~:text=Meaning%20of%20%F0%9F%9A%80%20Rocket%20Emoji,user%20is%20determined%20to%20fulfill.)[\ud83d\ude80](https://emojis.wiki/rocket/#:~:text=Meaning%20of%20%F0%9F%9A%80%20Rocket%20Emoji,user%20is%20determined%20to%20fulfill.)[\ud83d\ude80](https://emojis.wiki/rocket/#:~:text=Meaning%20of%20%F0%9F%9A%80%20Rocket%20Emoji,user%20is%20determined%20to%20fulfill.)[\ud83d\ude80](https://emojis.wiki/rocket/#:~:text=Meaning%20of%20%F0%9F%9A%80%20Rocket%20Emoji,user%20is%20determined%20to%20fulfill.)",

I was 16 at the time and I am now 17, turning 18 in about a month. My stock picks included CRSP, ZIOP, FLEX, CELG (bought by BMY), TGT, IBM, and SGEN. You can see the amounts in my previous post. I entered the market on October 29, 2018.\n\nThe last time I posted there were concerns of underaged trading, but all trading was done through a custodial account by my mom. \n\nAnyways, when I posted the majority of responses told me to sell at least some of my position, but I decided not to. My account precede to grow to $19,500 before cashing down to $10,500 during the coronavirus crash. Now my account is at $33,000 and I am glad I never sold.\n\n Although I didn't mention it at the time , my mom also invest $10,000 in the stock market at the same time picking some of the same stocks as me, but also some of her own including QCOM, INTC, and TSLA (yup). I didn't mention it at the time because her account was not performing as well as mine. Now it is at $44,000. \n\nLast night I was able to convince my mom to sell her position in TSLA ($20,000) on the market open today. We both also sold other stock we didn't see much more potential in like TGT, FLEX and some USO we picked up when it was down. We made a nice profit on each of those picks. I now have $7,500 in cash and my mom has $24,000 in cash.\n\nI thought you all might like the update, so here it is. Also, last time I posted someone recommended picking up ENPH, which I didn't and is now up 500%. Oh well.",

This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher.

Although the major averages did finish Monday trading well off their worst levels, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 still posted their largest one-day declines since Oct. 28. The Dow dropped 1.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell 1.5%. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\nWall Street\u2019s attention will in large part be focused on today\u2019s Georgia runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate. Both Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, must beat GOP incumbents, Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, to capture the majority for their party.

It\u2019s a reversal of a decision announced a few days earlier, which had been made in compliance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Carl Icahn, in remarks to CNBC\u2019s Scott Wapner, warned that stocks could face a significant decline in the future and he indicated he was hedged accordingly. \u201cIn my day I\u2019ve seen a lot of wild rallies with a lot of mispriced stocks, but there is one thing they all have in common. Eventually they hit a wall and go into a major painful correction. Nobody can predict when it will happen, but when that does happen, look out below,\u201d the billionaire investor said.

The FDA acknowledged the suggestions were made with the hopes of rolling out the vaccine more broadly to the public. However, with \u201cadequate scientific evidence,\u201d the regulatory agency said it believes changing the dosing amount or delaying the second shot by a few more weeks \u201cmay ultimately be counterproductive to public health.\u201d (Reuters)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * UK is delaying second vaccine shots and it\u2019s proving controversial.

Known has Haven, the organization was created with the goal of working to lower costs and improve outcomes in health care.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, January 7, 2020**\n\nStocks rose Thursday as market participants shook off Wednesday\u2019s civil unrest in Washington and looked ahead towards the policy implications of the incoming Democratic Senate and Presidential administration.\n\nYesterday, as lawmakers debated President-Elect Biden\u2019s election victory, protesters in support of Donald Trump broke through the barricades and flooded the Capitol Building. In response, the building was placed under lockdown and Trump deployed the national guard and other law enforcement agencies to control the chaos. Hours later, lawmakers reconvened and certified President-Elect Biden\u2019s victory in the Electoral College and officially recognized him as the next president. \n\nPresident-Elect Biden called the event an \u201cinsurrection\u201d and called on President Trump to go on national television to demand the end of the chaos. President Trump published a video on his social media, where he told protesters to go home but continued to reiterate baseless claims of election fraud. In response, Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube temporarily suspended Trump\u2019s accounts. World and Business leaders across the world publicly condemned the violence and urged America to undergo a peaceful transition of power. \n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Democrat John Ossof won the second Georgia runoff election defeating incumbent David Perdue. Democrat Raphael Warnock also won his race against Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler. This gives Democrats a slim majority in the Senate when considering Vice President-Elect has the ability to cast a tie-breaking ballot.\n\nDespite the political turmoil yesterday, the market largely shook off losses late in yesterday\u2019s session to reach record levels today. In a note to clients, Raymond James analyst Ed Mills wrote, \u201cWhen I look at the market reaction here \u2026 there is a recognition here that there is a certain inevitability in terms of what happens on January 20.

It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***At Close of Tuesday***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n**Tuesday was a green day.

We seek to enable our management partners to transform their platforms by capitalizing on technology disruption, acquisition opportunities and **accelerating growth in key emerging markets**, particularly China, India and Southeast Asia. Our intent is to drive long-term growth and build a successful public company through disciplined strategic execution and a **commitment to environmental sustainability, social responsibility and strong corporate governance (ESG).** With CXO-level operating capabilities developed at leading large-scale global technology companies, as well as entrepreneurial insight and expertise, we believe our founders\u2019 diverse and complementary backgrounds can have a transformative impact on a target business.\n\n**Investment Focus** \\- We focus on enabling our partner management teams to transform their platforms by capitalizing on technology disruption, acquisition opportunities and accelerating growth globally.\n\n\u00b7 **Technology** \\- Positioning innovators with next generation disruptive technologies to drive long-term value for customers.\n\n\u00b7 **Industrial Tech** \\- Accelerating growth opportunities for industrial companies by leveraging advanced technologies.\n\n\u00b7 **Med/Health Tech** \\- Enabling the leading Med/Health Tech companies to realize superior outcomes and efficiencies through digital transformation.\n\n**Prominent Leadership:**\n\n**Mike Cordano, Former COO of Western Digital** \\- For over three decades, Mike Cordano has been a catalyst for growth and transformation with a proven track record of creating new markets by anticipating technology inflection points and market disruptions. From October 2015 to March 2020, Mr. Cordano was the President and COO of Western Digital Corporation, a leading developer and manufacturer of data storage devices and solutions worldwide, where he was responsible for all the operating functions of the company\u2014including the Business Units, Engineering, Operations, Sales, Marketing and Information Technology\n\n**Mark Long, Founder, Founder of Silicon Valley Data Capital** \\- Mark Long is a 25-year Silicon Valley veteran with broad strategic, financial and transactional experience. He has focused on driving innovation and value creation throughout his career as an experienced technology executive, investor and investment banker with an emphasis on the software, SaaS, digital media, Internet, entertainment and storage sectors. Mr. Long drove a 10-year transformation of the data storage industry, most recently as CFO (2016\u20142019) and CSO (2015\u20142019) of Western Digital, where he led strategy development, mergers and acquisitions, corporate investments, financial management, investor relations, accounting and related activities.\n\n**Cathleen Benko** **Former Chief Communications Officer of Deloitte;** **Member of Board of Directors of NIKE** \\- Cathleen Benko is known as a strategist, innovative thinker and market cultivator with a pattern of being tapped for roles where breakthrough progress is needed. During her nearly 30-year career with Deloitte LLP (\u2018\u2018Deloitte\u2019\u2019), Ms. Benko held many leadership roles, several concurrent with her appointment as Vice Chairman and Managing Principal in 2011, including serving as Senior Partner working within Deloitte\u2019s \u2018\u2018Digital Giants\u2019\u2019 practice where she was the senior advisory partner for several digital-native companies, as the Chief Digital, Brand and Communications Officer of Deloitte, and has held multiple technology and talent management roles.\n\n**Dixon Doll, Co-founder, Accel Partners** ***-*** For more than 35 years, Dixon Doll has influenced and guided entrepreneurs, investors and executives in the computer, communications, and internet industries. In the mid-1980s, Mr. Doll co-founded the venture capital industry\u2019s first fund focused exclusively on telecommunication opportunities, Accel Partners. Also, Mr. Doll co-founded DCM Ventures, formerly Doll Capital Management, where he built a leading, global venture capital firm with offices in Silicon Valley, Beijing and Tokyo. DCM Ventures is also widely regarded as the first Silicon Valley venture firm to successfully invest in China, Japan and the U.S***.***\n\n*Other notable leadership include:*  Keyur Patel (Former Chief Strategy Officer, KPMG) and more found on there website. [https://www.primeimpactcapital.com/board-of-directors](https://www.primeimpactcapital.com/board-of-directors) \n\n**Underwriters:** \n\nIt is interesting to note the powerful underwriters, GS and BoFa, who will both aid in the merger process. According to a recent 8-K filed on October 13, 2020, BoFa and GS elected to purchase nearly $25,000,000 in units \u2013 a good sign.\n\n\u201cOn October 2, 2020, **the Underwriters partially exercised the Over-allotment Option to purchase as additional 2,408,414 units (the \u201cOption Units\u201d)**. Each Option Unit consists of one Class A Ordinary Share and one-third of one Public Warrant. On October 6, 2020, the Company completed the sale of the Option Units to Underwriters for net proceeds of approximately $23,602,457 in the aggregate after deducting the underwriter discount (the \u201cOption Unit Proceeds\u201d).\u201d\n\n**Stock Analysis:**\n\n**Commons (NYSE: PIAI)** \\- $10.41 \u2013 Trading at 200,000 volume as of Friday closing, double the average 10-day volume (106,000). This stock has been slowly climbing since its inception a few months ago. \n\n**Warrants (NYSE: PIAIWT)** \\- $1.66 \u2013 Trading at 107,000 volume as of Friday closing, nearly double the average 10-day volume (59,000).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is not investment advice. Given the current market conditions, anything can happen. However, relative to peers and similar SPACs, I believe that PIAI is currently undervalued and has great potential for three reasons (1) investment focus, (2) prominent leadership, and (3) underwriting electing to purchase shares. This, in combination with the current SPAC price at the time of this writing, leads me to believe that PIAI is a strong investment choice with a great risk-to-reward ratio.\n\n***Tl;dr*** *\u2013 PIAI is seeking a data-centric target within emerging markets, specifically with a focus on technology, industrial tech, or med/health tech. It has strong leadership ties to the CEO of Western Digital and powerful BoD with many ties within the data space. At a price close to NAV, this is a long-term hold based on the evaluation against peers and underlying characteristics.*",

        "selftext": "In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term\n\n\\~Very Long Post\\~ \\[Do NOT Read if you don't like comprehensive analysis\\]\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation.\n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also working with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with Xilinx , which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. Xilinx has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would create synergies. They are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they expect an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA.\n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach.\n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high demand the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax.\n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, these are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.\n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology.\n\nThe company also has very good financials, with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once Intel also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all.\n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Lisa SU has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the company has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "I missed last year's incredible bull run in a lot of tech. I played the options market more and held cash. Now I'm looking for decent value holds. AMD's most recent earnings blowout has me pretty exciting that they're living up to the hype. As far as I can see their P/E was basically cut in half after their report last week. That, plus the fact that their stock has been dropping ever since makes me think this is an excellent dip to buy. \n\nAny thoughts or comments are appreciated.

        "selftext": "AMD was another stock targeted in Robinhood's restricted stock list late last week. This is absurd as AMD is a major player amongst the chip-makers recently seeming to have surpassed Intel in marketshare. It's chips are used in both the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, showing that it is a major player on both sides of the gaming community.\n\nRobinhood has created artificial selling pressure on AMD, while AMD's short interest has increased to 5.9% Not a ton of short interest, but this number has only recently grown in correlation with the limitations put into place by Robinhood. Coincidence? I think not! Corruption? Maybe a little bit.\n\nThere are also clear indicators that AMD will continue to gain market share in the GPU/Chip industry. As recently they had to diverge some production to Samsung as Taiwan Semiconductors could not produce enough fast enough. (Source:  [https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung))\n\nAlong with these basic facts reflecting on AMD's product portfolio, something essential to do; one can see they are boasting their strongest product portfolio line in years including their new 7 Ryzen 5000 chip that is for both mobile processors and desktops. Sales of the Ryzen chip grew 18% YoY, this had assisted in amazing earnings growth.\n\nAMD's Earnings Summary 2019 vs. 2020 showed Record revenue of 9.76 Billion up 45% from 2019. Their gross margin of 45% increased for the 5th straight year. Along with this Net Income and EPS doubled from the prior year. Finally operating cash flow was up to 1.07 billion a 117% increase YoY, and they had record free cash flow of $777 Million a 182% increase YoY. All together this makes for an extremely strong balance sheet with 2.29 Billion in cash, cash equivilants and short term investments.\n\nThe one major risk I see in AMD is that Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all want to begin to create their own in-house chips. Along with this while AMD has surpassed Intel and is competing with Nividia, it could lose market share and fall behind. This company faced bankruptcy twice once in 2000 when the tech bubble popped, and again in 2012. However, I believe that this company will continue there exponential growth and have major gains in it's stock over the course of 2021 and see $100 by the end of February.\n\nHope this is all helpful!  \n\nDisclosure: I own 30 shares of AMD and will continue to hold for the years to come.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nA lot of you don't know me, as I don't usually post here. I'm usually over at /r/AMD_stock posting DD there. But I'm posting here because the recent activity in the stock led me to realize a huge, glaring problem with the stock's performance and it's latest earnings.\n\nLet me step back a bit first.\n\nLast Friday the stock plummeted 12% after posting the best earnings it possibly could have posted. At AMD_Stock, we usually brush off the post-earnings crush and continue our bull plays (or the smarter ones wait until after earnings to get back in). But this post-earnings crush was different. For this earnings, there was zero fundamental reason why the stock should go down. The earnings were excellent, the margins were excellent, the guidance for 1Q21 was incredible, and the guidance for FY21 was almost double what the street was expecting. Yet the stock still went down. It went down from $94 pre-earnings to almost $84....*on the best possible news*. \n\nWhat more could the street have wanted? Did shareholders want a +60% revenue increase YoY, instead of just +40%? Did they want 3x year-over-year revenue in 1Q20, instead of just 2x? Did the street expect us to beat our FY20 targets by more than they anticipated? Did investors want the fab capacity issues to be completely resolved earlier than 2Q21? Did they want Milan to be released earlier than March '21? Was there any reason to sell off after an earnings as incredible as that? You could even see the [bewilderment](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/27/full-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-on-q4-results-product-pipeline-demand-and-more.html) on Lisa Su's face as she started an interview with CNBC the morning after.\n\nWhy? [No financial news](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-q4-2020-advanced-micro-devices-earnings/), not even [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/amd-amd-earnings-q4-2020.html), could pin a 'reason' on the drop.\n\nAnd then I realized the problem. It's you.\n\nYou buy the cheapest AMD weeklies you can and hold them through earnings like it can't go tits up. You hope that AMD beats all expectations, and that the stock price skyrockets on your tendie-train choo-choo-ing to the moon. Post-earnings you sell your OTM calls just as they go ITM to some suck-ass broker-dealer, and go do some hookers and blow and make a golden shrine to Mama Su and thank her for your amazing luck. Good thing those stupid broker-dealers were so desperate to buy your calls just before expiry.. you would have bankrupted them if you held on to them any longer!\n\nThe day after earnings comes and you wake up and the price is down 5% and dropping. You sell immediately, because you can't see it recovering by Friday, when your calls expire. This causes MMs to sell the shares they bought as a hedge against selling you your calls. Stock goes down further. Other people sell their calls, and MMs sell more shares to reduce the hedge even more, on and on until Friday expiration rolls around and bag-holders let their calls expire worthless, along with their hopes and dreams.\n\nStop losing at AMD! How? *INVEST PROPERLY*\n\nHow? Buy and hold shares or LEAPS. Stop chasing the mythical overnight gains. AMD is a *long-term success* and it has [room to double](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l6jijo/rosenblatt_securities_says_amd_could_double_in/). DO IT NOW - Price is recovering from the crush, but are still trading at a [20% discount to analyst consensus](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast), and at a 10% discount from it's recent highs.\n\nConclusion: This is a better buy-and-hold than GME, BB, or anything. AMD has grown continuously in the past 5 years and, if you read the DD on /r/AMD_stock, you'll discover that it also has an incredible growth roadmap the next 5 years.\n\nStop losing. Buy shares and double your money.\n\nPositions: 4800 AMD shares @ $27.96",

Unless you yourself decide that you're willing to sell at a lower price.\n\nWhen selling at $100 -&gt; YOU ARE SAYING IT'S WORTH THIS LITTLE. YOU DECIDE AT WHAT PRICE YOU'RE WILLING TO SELL. If you don't WANT to sell at $100 WAIT TILL YOU CAN SELL IT TO FUCKING MELVIN AT $6000.\n\nPlus: Loss Aversion\n\nA loss of 10% is emotionally more powerfull than a gain of 10%. They are preying on this effect to bring you to make an emotional decision to PANIC and sell at loss. WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LOSE MONEY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOLD TODAY\n\nHOLD TOMORROW\n\nHOLD FOREVER\n\nIF YOU NEED THE MONEY, WAIT FOR IT TO FUCKING TURN GREEN YOU IMBECILE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHIS IS JUST A DELUSIONAL AUTISTIC FUCK SPEAKING AND NO FINANCIAL ADVICE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nSince WSB became a fucked up game of finding an imposter -&gt; I was active on WSB a while ago on a different account (MICRON, early AMD) and since moved to subs like /r/financialindependence /r/FIRE etc. and switched to low-cost index funds and mainly stick to this kind of investments and kept an eye on WSB for enterntainment. This account has since been deleted by me because friends of mine (and coworkers) got ahold of that accounts username. I had some history that was too personal for them to know about.\n\nI only moved onto the GME bandwagon out of spite, the moment BUY's got blocked on RH. This is the only and last \"WSB\" move I'm gonna do. \n\nIt doesn't have any meaning as I could write whatever, but my username is my job in the banking sector. I know people that work in HF's, used to work decades in HF's. I didn't quite believe what they told me about the possibilities they have. But now I do.\n\nBuy low, sell high is the foundation of any trade you do. Even GME. \n\nIf you thought this move would be a quick buck over a few days, no. If you bought after the surge, it just doesn't make ANY sense selling. NONE. You cut your potential of any breakeven, ever.\n\nEven if the short squeeze wouldn't happen due to highly illegal tactics by HF, GameStop has way more potential now than before. The company is in international spotlight, has an easy way to raise capital after the trade still, has global logistics... It still has potential as a company, if you sell now, you lose out on any chance of ever covering that loss.",

Some highlights from their earnings:\n\n* Record revenue for the year with $9.76 billion in revenue\n* Q4 Revenue up 53% to $3.244 billion (also record quaterly revenue)\n* Gross profit up 53% to $1.451 billion\n* Net income up to $1.78 billion compared to $170 million a year ago\n* EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $1.45 per share\n* Cash flow up to $554 million YoY\n* Q1 2021 guidance: 3.2B in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin\n* FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY\n* Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future\n\nSu bae has been delivering hard on her promises, and I see no reason for this momentum to not carry forward into 2021.

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "On Friday Robinhood went after WSB\u2019s first love Suebae. \nUsers were limited to buy only ONE share of AMD after they announced a record quarter. Why??? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s see - AMD is heavily invested in by big funds. AMD announces a record quarter, the stock begins to sell off!? Many people on r/amd_stock theorise this is institutional money trying to liquidate cash and take profits after getting hit by GME. \n\nBut wait, AMD short interest just rose from [52m to 107m.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l7uw06/short_interest_on_amd_has_doubled_from_52_million/ ) Up over 50% in 2 and a half weeks after the company grows 50% and produces record results..\n\n\n\nThen Robinhood adds AMD to the list of stocks you can only buy a limited amount of and limit it to ONE share. Wtf? \n\n\nAMD isn\u2019t part of any of the massive shorting going on in the market and is a pretty stable company. So why would they do this? Oh right, because AMD is one of the most held stocks on RH and many young investors like the company on a consumer level. So while it\u2019s at a discount they want to stop you buying in so their buddies with the short positions can load up and get their money back after getting wrecked by GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:**\n\nFunds with large positions in AMD are shorting the stock before selling off stock they previously held. This drops the price and they collect a nice bonus on the way out. \nThe short interest in the stock has increase drastically by over 50%, and of course between earnings and RH limiting trading we saw a number of hit piece articles with false information about AMD. But weirdly enough no one report on the leaks that [AMD are now powering Tesla\u2019s in car game console/entertainment system.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l749ia/patrick_schur_picture_confirms_tesla_uses_navi_23/) Last time there was even a rumour of AMD supplying Tesla the stock went vertical. \n \n\nI\u2019m sure the OGs here remember the blatant manipulation that happened with this stock back in the days when it was $2-$20. People like Goldman would downgrade the stock, load up on stock and wait for it to rally, sell, and then downgrade again.\nThese guys are back using AMD as their personal money printer because they just got wrecked.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Oh, and you know who happens to own 2.1m shares in AMD? That\u2019s right, [MELVIN CAPITAL.](https://fintel.io/so/us/amd)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut here\u2019s one thing RH didn\u2019t think about. \nXilinx is about to be acquired by AMD in an all stock deal, this means both stocks move in unison with each other. And more importantly, the daily average trade volume of Xilinx is only 3m compared to AMDs 45.15m\n\nThis means if a number of people decide they like Xilinx stock, AMD will follow far faster than if they decided to simply like AMD stock. And since there\u2019s no limits on Xilinx people can currently like the stock as much as they want.\n\nSide note - If you *really* like Xilinx and hold until the deal is complete, you will be given 1.734 shares in AMD for every Xilinx share you own. If this deal happened right now at current prices, this means you would make around 10% on your investment compared to just holding the same amount in AMD.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Please note:** I am not a financial advisor, just some long term WSB member here to explain that if everyone jumped into Xilinx instead of AMD the shorts would get pretty screwed. They think they found a way to make their money back, it would be pretty nice if they didn\u2019t. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**HOLD GME**\n\n**LIKE XILINX (if you want I\u2019m not a financial advisor)**\n\n**DESTROY THE SHORTS**\n\n**FUCK ROBINHOOD**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, shoutout to [Hothardware for being the only news website talking about this](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-robinhood-gamestop-gme-shorts-wallstreetbets\n). \nSomething is very wrong here and we need everyone to know it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR; - GO READ IT, STOP BEING LAZY.

        "selftext": "So I saw headlines about semiconductor demand far outpacing supply. There\u2019s also news of Intel finally giving up and no longer taking losses trying to make chips. \nCars have created an especially huge demand for semis and virtually every car now needs one. \n\nhttps://www.extremetech.com/extreme/319627-semiconductor-shortage-could-cost-automakers-61b-in-lost-sales\n\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29T04V\n\nI came across TSM Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturers which had just over 50% market share. Their biggest customer is Apple. \n\nhttps://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionSEG2.php?code=TSM\n\nNow, I couldn\u2019t believe the numbers I saw for TSM. I figured every site was wrong because the following cannot possibly be true: \nMarket Cap- 571 billion\n2020 revenue - 1.4 Trillion (yes trillion). the revenue is up 30% from 2019 (yes during a pandemic). \nEarnings- 530billion.  \n\nThis means that they are trading at 1:1 P/E ratio. \n\nCompare that to AMD (106bil market cap - 2.5billion earnings - 38 P/E and NVDA 321marketcap - 2.8bil earnings - 140 P/E.\nIntel has market cap of $230bil - $20bil earnings - 11 p/E\n\nSo shouldn\u2019t TSM have a market cap of at least 5 trillion?? How is no one talking about the fact that their revenue during a pandemic is 1.4 trillion with profit margin of 40%??? \n\nI think there are some seriously sweet tendies to be made. The IV is pretty low and you can get 2022 calls with a 200 strike for $5. Or a 2023 call with 200strike for $12. \n\nSomeone please explain how this is possible and what I am missing. This is a no brainer. \n\nAlso, for the first time ever, TSM will be building a plant in the USA \n\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/11/25/intels-ceo-just-asked-joe-biden-to-do-this/\n\nLastly, Biden has a phone call with TSM this Friday.\n\n\nEDIT: thank you for pointing out that my numbers were in TWN not USD.  I effed up.  Still a great company.",

        "selftext": "So my last post simply talked about my play on Corsair and there seemed to be a lot of disagreement so here's my actual DD behind it. Also before we get into this, for all the Logitech nerds on my last post, nobody cares that your mom bought you a $10 Logitech keyboard and you like the noises it makes, it doesn't change the fact that Corsair have better quality products for pretty much everything besides mice(my opinion).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk so first things first, we all know that the gaming industry as a whole had boomed due to COVID and has had an increasing TAM for quite some time now and is projected to continue its growth. For that reason alone I'm bullish on a lot of gaming companies other than a few that I believe have way too high of a valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets start with marketing. If any of you have as poor of a social life as I since COVID started then you'd know that Corsair has been very active in social media marketing/sponsorships on Twitch. It feels like I keep seeing more and more streamers show sponsor slides of Corsair gear. This is amazing because in my personal opinion, I believe Twitch and YouTube sponsorships is easily one of the best ways to promote your products(referring to gaming products only). Just look at recent games that have all blown up, Fortnite, Apex Legends, Warzone, and Rust have all blown up due to their large presence on Twitch. Apex Legends and Rust quite literally paid streamers to play the game and look at how well that worked out for them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext up we'll take a look at financials, don't worry I'm not going to sit here and tell you to do your full in depth fundamental analysis reasoning report but I do think we should at least pay attention to it. Even before COVID and still during COVID Corsair has increased revenues, net income, and cash flow. This just adds extra proof that its not like Corsair was a failing company before they got the boost from COVID. Another major positive would be that Corsair has increased focus around R&amp;D which has only proven to significantly help tech companies move ahead of their competitors and acquire more market share. Just a couple companies that also focused R&amp;D would be Tesla(all praise father Elon) and AMD. There's obviously more to the financial aspect however I'd rather not sit here and type out their entire 10-K in a reddit post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, I think with all DD you must point out the negatives as you go along. As I stated before, Logitech definitely beats Corsair when it comes to mice. However, I typed this entire post without using a mouse so who really cares about mice. Secondly, Corsair's CEO is Andy Paul. How can you put a billion dollar company in the hands of a man with two first names and to be honest, I don't know how they do it. Although that is definitely a big negative, their logo is extremely cool which I think makes up for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time, now lets preheat this oven and start baking some tendies!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Logitech fanboys please don't attack me in the comments, I don't care about your mice, just leave me alone and go play pong or something with your amazing mouse.",

NOKIA  (I think in \\~5 years 5G tech can help them pivot a little bit,  besides... 20B cap market and \\~5$ shares seems extremely undervalued) .\n2. AMD  - I think it will go up and their tech is solid, although... Apple and  new M1 chips (Apple Silicon) makes me doubt, about if Apple will use AMD  in the future and if not - that might be a nice dip possibility to buy  in.\n3. Rolls-Royce,  which is like 0.9$ a share now. It's really low and I figured... They  are making Jet Engines right? Wouldn't they prosper a little better in  next 3-5 years? But more research is needed in this one for me. I'm  Software Engineer so... Nokia and AMD is something, that I understand  and see potential. As for this - I'm not really sure. More of a guess.\n\nOverall,  I still don't know what is my view point on stock market in 2021.  After crazy 2020, I thought that some slight correction of 10-15% on the  whole market is possible, so... I try to be very cautious with  investments now.  If it will happen...

        "selftext": "I have been a long-term investor of AMD over the past few years and I have been rewarded immensely for it. But a trend I have been noticing for the past half-year is that despite meeting and beating expectations and guidance, high-growth stocks in the semiconductor sector seems to have hit a wall in SP. In particular, I am not just referring to AMD but NVDA as well. On the contrary, stocks with higher earnings but lower growth seem to be regaining momentum, most notably Intel, MU, TSM and others.\n\nThis has led me to exit my AMD position and take a serious look at the stock market as a whole. Over the past half-year, there has been an unjustified exuberance in EV stocks. I don't think it takes much convincing to see that the SP of multiple EV stocks (most notoriously TSLA) seem to be out-of-whack with reality and future expectations.\n\nThis has led me to think that more rational investors are either exiting the market or moving into stocks with lower growth/risk. If the EV bubble is being propped up by inexperienced investors that are not trading in-line with fundamentals, then a market correction could easily accelerate into a crash for these stocks. And investors moving into low-risk stocks prior to a crash has precedence as well (dot-com bubble). \n\nOne more bit that has me thinking: The GME and related meme stocks seem to be crashing and the shorts and more rational investors seem to be regaining the upper hand. This could serve as a momentum for others to re-look their investments in very risky and overvalued assets. Could this be the trigger for the EV bubble popping?",

Since I like forbidden fruits, I went ahead and did my own research on the company. I'm sharing the results with you:\n\nNova Measuring Instruments is an Israel-based company (with 18 offices worldwide) that provides metrology solutions (devices and software) for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nMetrology means measuring, and in this context, super precise measuring (nanometer or smaller) required for semiconductor manufacturing. The company's metrology solutions use technologies including Optical Scatterometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), scatterometry modeling software, and high-performance computing. The company holds 30 patents in this field.\n\nMarket cap: \\~2.2 Billion\n\nP/E ratio: \\~42\n\nHas beaten earning expectations in the past 4 quarters (didn't check further back)\n\nThe stock price has grown almost 100% in the last year, which is good but nothing compared to NNDM, for instance, which has grown 540%.\n\nDaily volume is low (about 150,000)\n\nIn a recent (Jan 28, 2021) [press release](https://www.novami.com/investors/press-releases/nova-receives-multiple-materials-metrology-orders-from-leading-logic-and-foundry-customers/), the company announced that it \"received multiple orders from multiple leading Logic and Foundry customers for its most advanced materials metrology solutions.\"  They don't name the new clients, but could one of them be $TSM?\n\nAnyway, we know that all sorts of trendy technologies such as EVs, AI, Cloud, etc. need processors and memory devices, which brings our attention to companies such as $AMD, $INTC, $ON, and $TSM. But these companies in turn need precise measuring devices for their process control, and NVMI is the leader in that area.\n\nThe company's technology/patents can also be useful in 3D printers that print precise things (again, such as NNDM).\n\nI did a quick search and it seems no one has done a DD on this in WSB. I think it has great growth potential both short term and long term. Once WB is over the BANG stocks, this is something worth a look at. IMO, it will be similar to stocks like MGNI and SE that consistently move up without much buzz around them on WSB.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnicals:\n\nI don't know much about technicals but according to tradingview, it's neutral based on oscillators, and strong buy based on moving averages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy positions:Stocks80C 5/21/2021\n\nThe options market for this stock is low volume and there are large gaps between bid/ask prices, so I suggest going with the stocks.",

        "selftext": "This is not a post about whether GME is going to 0 or Pluto. This post is strictly about what one should or shouldn\u2019t do if one wants to buy/sell GME. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Figure out how much you are willing to trade. Treat the money you are willing to trade as lost money. This way you know your max loss and if you are willing to accept that loss, then you can diamond hand any red day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Don\u2019t trade on margin. One of my best friends bought AMD at $2 and still lost it all because he went on margin and was forced to liquidate. Brokerages can and will manually liquidate your positions to cover their asses. Bottom line, don\u2019t do it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Have an exit strategy. Let\u2019s be honest here, the distance to the moon, Pluto, and Andromeda are finite, same goes for GME. You don\u2019t have to admit it to anyone on WSB, but you should always have a number that when reached, you are willing to exit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Don\u2019t get greedy. The saying that pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered is very true. Ask any \ud83d\udc3b who held on past 4/1/2020 to show you their account and you will see. Again, you don\u2019t have to admit it here, but know it in your heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Be fluid. Market condition changes, that goes both ways. Assuming you are following the above rules, there may be days where you will buy the dip. To the contrary, there may be days when you profit take. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. Don\u2019t be a sheep. Let\u2019s be honest with ourselves for a moment. Not all hedge funds are betting against GME. There are hedge funds betting on GME. Moreover, there are people who are trying to profit from directional movement in either direction and are spreading lies on WSB to enrich themselves. Don\u2019t be a sheep and blindly follow others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. Be on the look out for the next 10 bagger. I assume that almost no one here wants GME to be their last trade. I\u2019m not saying you should sell your positions, what I\u2019m saying is always be on the lookout for the next big thing while you hold on to your position. It would be the same thing as you getting into GME when it was $5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. Don\u2019t let GME break you. Trading takes a toll no matter if you are up or down. Don\u2019t let one trade crush you. Remember, you are trading to get rich so you can better yourself, not trading to become a slave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*I have never purchased or sold short,  nor do I intend to purchase or sell short any GME equities or derivatives. Having said that, I wish my WSB brothers best of luck.",

This amount is the maximum loss amount if the underlying stock or index moves the entire spread in the money (ITM) and also the collateral that would be required by the brokerage. While % Return is the total premium collected as a percentage of the max risk amount. \n\nAll trades listed were opened anywhere between 0 and 7 DTE, with deltas in the short leg ranging between 10 and 20. The game plan is to collect premiums on spreads, with the best outcome having the short leg expire out of the money (OTM). \n\nIn the month of January alone, the portfolio experienced a maximum drawdown of 8.4% from its peak. The number would have definitely been much higher if it wasn't for these key factors:\n\n* Position sizing / trade allocation, where trades were sized properly to contain risk.\n* Trade timing / entry, where trades are entered at specific times of day for best premiums and chance of getting filled. \n* Trade diversification, where not all trades are in the same basket of stocks and carry different direction or +/- deltas.  \n\nYes, there's something about pennies and steamrollers to be said about these trades, where the % return is consistent for a few trades and suddenly a -100% return shows up to take all of the hard earned premium back. \n\nIn fact, that's exactly what happened on one of the 0 DTE SPX trades. That's where allocation, timing, and diversification helps, where we can fully expect to experience a complete loss on a small number of trades, but still come out ahead profitable overall.  \n\nFor those interested, feel free to reach out for more information or to see the full list of trades we executed in January 2021. \n\nWe\u2019re also keen on getting this community\u2019s feedback and thoughts on our trades executed; happy to share our reasoning on executing them. Let us know!\n\nOtherwise, stay safe and vigilant out there! We\u2019ll be back with another post to share our progress and findings next month!",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH).

The details of this is kept very secret, but they have a patented platform which they believe can change the future of electronics.\n\nWhy buy?\n\nOver the past few years POET have put together a really strong base to the company:\n\n* New CEO with a really strong technical background at GlobalFoundries who manufacture chips for AMD, Qualcomm, and many others\n* Some potentially really good joint ventures such as with Sanan\n* A really strong Board of Directors with a good mix of technical expertise and financing experience\n\nWhy now?\n\nLast month the company announced that they would have a special meeting with their shareholders about the potential listing of the company on the NASDAQ. Ever since, the SP has inflated and inflated, to the point that it is now up 90% in three weeks. It is likely that this will continue to inflate as excitement grows.\n\nThe suggestion that the company is to list on NASDAQ is an indication that they are more confident in their technology and it is getting closer to commercialisation, they just need a bit more capital to make it happen.\n\nEnd game?\n\nIf, and its a big if, this company is to have the platform which goes someway to replacing silicon in the future then we all know the value.\n\nPotential risks?\n\nRealistically, there is a chance another company is one step ahead of the curve and their technology will never make it in the future.\n\nSome close links to Chinese companies - future restrictions could hamper some of their JVs.",

        "selftext": "On Friday Robinhood went after WSB\u2019s first love Suebae. \nUsers were limited to buy only ONE share of AMD after they announced a record quarter. Why??? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s see - AMD is heavily invested in by big funds. AMD announces a record quarter, the stock begins to sell off!? Many people on r/amd_stock theorise this is institutional money trying to liquidate cash and take profits after getting hit by GME. \n\nBut wait, AMD short interest just rose from [52m to 107m.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l7uw06/short_interest_on_amd_has_doubled_from_52_million/ ) Up over 50% in 2 and a half weeks after the company grows 50% and produces record results..\n\n\n\nThen Robinhood adds AMD to the list of stocks you can only buy a limited amount of and limit it to ONE share. Wtf? \n\n\nAMD isn\u2019t part of any of the massive shorting going on in the market and is a pretty stable company. So why would they do this? Oh right, because AMD is one of the most held stocks on RH and many young investors like the company on a consumer level. So while it\u2019s at a discount they want to stop you buying in so their buddies with the short positions can load up and get their money back after getting wrecked by GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:**\n\nFunds with large positions in AMD are shorting the stock before selling off stock they previously held. This drops the price and they collect a nice bonus on the way out. \nThe short interest in the stock has increase drastically by over 50%, and of course between earnings and RH limiting trading we saw a number of hit piece articles with false information about AMD. But weirdly enough no one report on the leaks that [AMD are now powering Tesla\u2019s in car game console/entertainment system.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l749ia/patrick_schur_picture_confirms_tesla_uses_navi_23/) Last time there was even a rumour of AMD supplying Tesla the stock went vertical. \n \n\nI\u2019m sure the OGs here remember the blatant manipulation that happened with this stock back in the days when it was $2-$20. People like Goldman would downgrade the stock, load up on stock and wait for it to rally, sell, and then downgrade again.\nThese guys are back using AMD as their personal money printer because they just got wrecked.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Oh, and you know who happens to own 2.1m shares in AMD? That\u2019s right, [MELVIN CAPITAL.](https://fintel.io/so/us/amd)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut here\u2019s one thing RH didn\u2019t think about. \nXilinx is about to be acquired by AMD in an all stock deal, this means both stocks move in unison with each other. And more importantly, the daily average trade volume of Xilinx is only 3m compared to AMDs 45.15m\n\nThis means if a number of people decide they like Xilinx stock, AMD will follow far faster than if they decided to simply like AMD stock. And since there\u2019s no limits on Xilinx people can currently like the stock as much as they want.\n\nSide note - If you *really* like Xilinx and hold until the deal is complete, you will be given 1.734 shares in AMD for every Xilinx share you own. If this deal happened right now at current prices, this means you would make around 10% on your investment compared to just holding the same amount in AMD.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Please note:** I am not a financial advisor, just some long term WSB member here to explain that if everyone jumped into Xilinx instead of AMD the shorts would get pretty screwed. They think they found a way to make their money back, it would be pretty nice if they didn\u2019t. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**HOLD GME**\n\n**LIKE XILINX (if you want I\u2019m not a financial advisor)**\n\n**DESTROY THE SHORTS**\n\n**FUCK ROBINHOOD**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, shoutout to [Hothardware for being the only news website talking about this](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-robinhood-gamestop-gme-shorts-wallstreetbets\n). \nSomething is very wrong here and we need everyone to know it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR; - GO READ IT, STOP BEING LAZY.

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Hello (I am fairly new to investing btw),\nI want to ask what the Xilinx takeover by AMD will look like for me as a Xilinx shareholder. \nAs most people probably know AMD and Xilinx have an all stock transaction deal where current Xilinx shareholders will receive 1.7** shares of AMD in return for their Xilinx shares. \nNow I can\u2019t seem to find any news on this except for the fact that the deal is supposed to be closed in 2021. I am just wondering what it will look like for me; will my Xilinx shares automatically be switched by AMD shares or do I have to do something for it? And when do you expect it to be finalized?\nThanks in advance for the answers",

AMD, yeah remember the company everyone seemingly forgot about despite posting huge growth consistently in 2020? Well they recently had earnings and suffered bigly along with most tech. Some highlights from their earnings:\n\n* Record revenue for the year with $9.76 billion in revenue\n* Q4 Revenue up 53% to $3.244 billion (also record quaterly revenue)\n* Gross profit up 53% to $1.451 billion\n* Net income up to $1.78 billion compared to $170 million a year ago\n* EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $1.45 per share\n* Cash flow up to $554 million YoY\n* Q1 2021 guidance: 3.2B in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin\n* FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY\n* Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future\n\nSu bae has been delivering hard on her promises, and I see no reason for this momentum to not carry forward into 2021. They have gone on sale after earnings, and I can't wait to see what AMD has in store for 2021.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector.
