        "selftext": "(Bloomberg) -- Nikola Corp. has left a trail of inconsistent statements and contradictory announcements that are now coming under scrutiny from short-sellers eager to poke holes in the electric-vehicle company\u2019s success story.\n\nHindenburg Research, which holds a short position in Nikola stock and stands to gain if the shares fall, released a report Thursday detailing what it called \u201cdozens of lies\u201d about the company\u2019s capabilities, partnerships or products. The firm used internal emails, analyzed photos and even cited an investigator dispatched to rural Utah to test how far a car would roll down a hill. Nikola said Hindenburg\u2019s report was full of falsehoods but hasn\u2019t offered anything specific to rebut the allegations.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a hedge fund or a private eye to determine that Nikola, which struck a partnership this week with General Motors Co., has a pattern of discrepancies. A look at some of its announcements and filings, along with statements and tweets by Chairman Trevor Milton and other executives over the past few years, yields other examples that weren\u2019t part of Hindenburg\u2019s report. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit confusing trying to follow Trevor on his various social media outlets about the timing and cadence of communication of the different variables that you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Jeff Osborne, a Cowen &amp; Co. analyst, told executives on an Aug. 4 conference call.\n\nNikola\u2019s shares have tumbled 24% since the Hindenburg report, which, among other sources, cited a Bloomberg story from June about the company exaggerating the capabilities of a truck.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to doing our best to keep the investing public and all of our stakeholders informed and up to date at all times,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mark Russell said Friday in an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg about the following items.\n\nUnder Construction\n\nAt a press event on July 22, ahead of the groundbreaking of Nikola\u2019s Coolidge, Arizona, factory, Head of Global Manufacturing Mark Duchesne fielded a question on when construction would get underway. \u201cThat one is an easy answer,\u201d he said. \u201cStart of construction is tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe timeline was repeated by Milton the following day in a tweet. But \u201cconstruction\u201d turns out to be a broad term.\n\nTo facilitate the groundbreaking ceremony, the city of Coolidge issued Nikola a temporary use permit on July 13. The document, obtained by Bloomberg, allowed the company to do some limited ground clearing and preparation for holding the event, along with listing a plan for coronavirus safeguards. It didn\u2019t allow further construction to start beyond that. The company also obtained a Pinal County dust permit around the same time, a legal requirement in Arizona.\n\nOn Aug. 7, the company received its at-risk grading and drainage permit, City Manager Rick Miller said by phone. The permit allows Nikola to clear dirt and do drainage work on the site, but as yet the company doesn\u2019t have the permits required for foundation work, plumbing, electrical or vertical construction, Miller said. The permits are available through public-records requests.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nikola said in a tweet that Coolidge\u2019s city council had approved the company\u2019s \u201cfactory masterplan\u201d and that \u201cconstruction can now go forward.\u201d This is only partly true, Miller said. It was the planning and zoning commission that approved a \u201cmajor site plan.\u201d The approval will allow Nikola and its architects and engineers to apply for the next batch of permits.\n\nIn a statement, Nikola said that by \u201cconstruction\u201d it meant everything from groundbreaking to seeking permits. Now that its building plan is approved, \u201cthe various permits will be obtained in cadence with the steps of the construction. We remain on schedule for Phase 1,\u201d the company said in an email.\n\n\u201dThe factory will be up in 12 months,\u201d Milton said in a live broadcast on Instagram on Friday night. \u201cThe permit was just issued by the city. We are all good to go.\u201d\n\nPuzzling Partnership\n\nNikola has a stated ambition of manufacturing hydrogen-powered fuel cell semi trucks by 2023. Since 2017, it has had an agreement for German auto parts supplier Robert Bosch Gmbh to \u201cdevelop, build, test and support\u201d various components for Nikola\u2019s prototypes including a fuel-cell system, battery packs, steering pumps and motors, according to a regulatory filing in March.\n\nThe details of which partner is contributing what to the project has shifted over time, and the future of the deal has gotten hazier.\n\nNikola agreed to pay Bosch around $40 million for the development, according to the filing. In a presentation to investors in April, Nikola described the agreement with Bosch as a \u201cco-development\u201d and strategic supply chain partnership and said the company would jointly own any intellectual property developed with Bosch.\n\nHowever, Nikola executives have regularly stated that Nikola designed, developed and will provide much of the technology for its vehicles -- not Bosch. On Friday, Chief Financial Officer Kim Brady said that Nikola will provide only 15% of the parts in battery electric pickups due to be built in Ulm, Germany, while partner Iveco provides the rest. However, he added that Nikola\u2019s input represents 90% of the truck\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cWe are responsible for Nikola Tre -- the batteries, e-axle, e-motors, inverters, BMS system, infotainment system,\u201d Brady said. \u201cAll the key electric propulsion systems come from Nikola.\u201d\n\nAs recently as Aug. 25, Bosch has said that it\u2019s \u201cworking with the company to make the fuel-cell drive for trucks suitable for mass production.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Nikola announced that GM -- not Bosch -- will mass-supply a fuel cell system for Nikola\u2019s Class 7 and 8 semi trucks, as well as the battery packs for its debut electric pickup, the Badger. On Friday, Nikola clarified that Bosch will supply semi truck fuel cells in Europe, while GM will have exclusivity everywhere else.\n\n\u201cBosch is an investor, board member and supplier to Nikola. They help us in many facets of our business as our partner,\u201d Nikola said.\n\nMilton bristled at a claim by a Twitter user that Nikola was jilting Bosch in favor of GM.\n\n\u201cBosch as a company with a dedicated hydrogen strategy welcomes the decision of GM to enter this market as an important player,\u201d Bosch spokesman Tim Wieland said in an email. \u201cBeyond that, Nikola and Bosch have been working together for several years, not only on the fuel cell power train but also on other innovations like the steering system and the Mirror Cam System for the first prototypes of the Nikola trucks. The two companies will continue to cooperate in the future, also on fuel cells.\u201d\n\nGame Changer\n\nNikola\u2019s narrative about its battery strategy has also shifted over time.\n\nIn November 2019, Nikola issued a press release claiming to have \u201cgame-changing\u201d battery cell technology that it would unveil at an event in 2020. Nikola also said it had entered into a letter of intent to acquire a \u201cworld-class battery engineering team\u201d to help bring the new battery to pre-production.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about doubling the range of BEVs and hydrogen-electric vehicles around the world,\u201d Milton said in the statement.\n\nIn July, Milton tweeted that Nikola would \u201cmake the entire pack like the top guys do\u201d for its upcoming pickup truck, called the Badger. He said that all internal components, such as batteries, inverters, software and controls, are Nikola\u2019s own intellectual property. \u201cWe own it all in house,\u201d he said.\n\nMilton clarified in a tweet on Thursday that Nikola\u2019s change of direction -- to use GM\u2019s Ultium battery technology for the Badger -- was a result of cost analysis and cost savings.\n\nBeer Trucks\n\nBack in March, Nikola said in a presentation to investors that it has a \u201csigned binding agreement\u201d to provide Anheuser-Busch with as many as 800 hydrogen fuel cell electric semi trucks. What the presentation didn\u2019t say was that Anheuser-Busch committed to buy fewer trucks than that, and doesn\u2019t have to buy any at all.\n\nThe deal was first announced in May 2018 and stated the trucks were originally expected to be integrated into Anheuser-Busch\u2019s dedicated fleet by the end of 2020, according to a press release.\n\nThat timeline isn\u2019t going to be met. During the Aug. 4 earnings call, Russell, the CEO, updated investors on the deal, saying, \u201cWe do believe that we\u2019ll be able to give them test prototypes before the end of 2021; serial production or mass production of the fuel cell truck will not begin until 2023.\u201d\n\nThat does corroborate with the timeline for production set out in a July filing -- and to be fair, lots of people\u2019s plans have changed this year. But in the same filing, Nikola revealed that Anheuser-Busch retains the right to cancel the truck order, though there\u2019s no indication that will happen. The contract also has lease terms and rental rates that may be hard for Nikola to meet, according to the filing, \u201cdepending on our ability to develop our trucks and hydrogen network according to current design parameters and cost estimates.\u201d\n\nThe agreement between the two companies states that Anheuser-Busch gets priority of delivery for as much as 20% of Nikola\u2019s initial \u201cproduction line of Class 8 vehicles.\u201d To get production going by 2023, Nikola must work to have dedicated equipment in Anheuser Busch\u2019s breweries and distribution centers by the end of 2021, according to the deal terms. Anheuser-Busch only agreed to use at least 600 trucks -- the 800 figure, according to the document, is an estimate of what the brewer will need.\n\n\u201cThey have been, and continue to be, a great long-term partner in our shared vision of a zero-emission future (a Nikola Two prototype hauled our first load over public roads for them in St. Louis not too long ago),\u201d Russell said in the statement Friday, referring to Anheuser-Busch. \u201cOur original agreement with them has been modified over time. The current agreement terms are as we set forth in our earnings call.\u201d\n\nAnheuser-Busch didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The partnership with Nikola will help the brewer transition its entire long-haul fleet to zero-emission vehicles, Anheuser-Busch said last November.\n\nPrototype Production\n\nOn July 13, Milton said European partner Iveco was already producing vehicle prototypes.\n\n\u201cWe have a truck coming in to production right now with 720KwH, the largest battery we know of anywhere in the world coming in to production,\u201d Milton said on the TC\u2019s Charcast Podcast. \u201cWe have five of them coming off the assembly line right now in Ulm, Germany.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 4, during the company\u2019s debut earnings call, Russell echoed the sentiment, saying that the first five prototypes were \u201ccoming off the end of the facility at this point.\u201d\n\nThose statements were a mischaracterization of Nikola and Iveco\u2019s progress in Ulm, according to two people familiar with the matter. The assembly line is still under construction and not yet operational or building prototypes, the people said. There are prototypes being built by hand in a workshop, one of the people said.\n\n\u201cAs stated previously, the first five production prototypes of the Nikola Tre are being completed, by an assembly team at the Ulm facility. Also as stated previously, the Nikola/IVECO JV mass production line facility in Ulm is still under construction, and is on track for the start of regular serial production in 2021,\u201d Russell said Friday. \u201cWe anticipate that a number of current IVECO personnel will join the Nikola/IVECO JV production team in Ulm.\u201d\n\nNikola\u2019s Guidance\n\nHere\u2019s when Nikola has said it will hit its big milestones, based on filings, statements and interviews: [ ]\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/nikola-s-history-of-discrepancies-has-been-hiding-in-plain-sight-1.1492855",

        "selftext": "Wall Street likes to snooze on tech companies they don't understand. Cloudflare ($NET) is one of them. \n\n**Here is what's not to like about the company:**   \nIt currently trades 25x its revenue.  In Q2, $NET  reported a quarterly revenue of $99m and a net profit of  -$25m (negative). The company's market cap is about $11b. Publicly traded rivals include Fastly and Zscaler, both of which are much larger and currently much more successful. \n\n**So what does Cloudfare do?**   \nGenerally speaking, NET makes websites really fast and really secure. Backers of this company include  Google and Microsoft. Both of these companies also use its services. \n\nI'm sure most of you have heard about DDoS attacks. Well, Cloudflare is really busy trying to stop them: It said earlier this year that it blocks 72b DDoS attacks *each day.* It also provides what's called a \"content distribution network,\" or CDN. CDN's help negate websites from bottle necking. CDNs can also improve the overall user experience by making everything faster. \n\nThe company provides both free and paid services. It also has a \"pay as you go\" model, but that's there mostly to convert them into its SaaS offering, where it captures 95% of its revenue. The free service mostly exists because it fuels the company's product, \"Network Flywheel;\" the more people who use Cloudflare, the more effective its services are. They do a lot of other things, and pretty much own the whole stack, but for those who want to explore further, and get more specifics, [I suggest reading this.](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-raised-110m-from-fidelity-google-microsoft-baidu-and-qualcomm/) \n\n**So what's its current state?**   \nThe company currently provides services to 25m websites \u2014\u00a0a number that will continue to grow as many businesses are forced to go through so-called \"digital transformations\" as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\n**In the company's most recent earnings, Matthew Prince, CEO, said:** \"*We had a very strong quarter. Our Q2 revenue came in just shy of $100  million, up 48% year-over-year. We saw strength from our customers of  all sizes. We grew our large customer accounts, those paying us more  than $100,000 annually by 65% year-over-year. We also added nearly 7,000  new paying customers, bringing our total paying customer count to over  90,000. At the same time, we saw strong growth across our existing  customer base as they adopted more features of the Cloudflare platform.\"*\n\nPrince added that the effects of the pandemic have served as a boon to its business. And the company raised both its Q3 and annual guidance (though it's known to lowball its guidance). In 2019, $NET grew at a rate of about 50% each quarter. \n\nThey have been busy hiring new employees to meet demand; an unscientific check on LinkedIn reveals it currently has 257 openings. It also has a $50 price target from a lot of analysts. \n\n**What's next:**   \nAs we head into winter, more businesses will look to sell their goods, service, online as people bunker in to avoid catching the coronavirus. This change in consumer behavior will further accelerate its business. It's something I think Wall Street is snoozing on, especially with headlines that suggest you're twice as likely to die from COVID if you have the flu. \n\nAlso, unlike rivals such as Zscalar, Cloudflare is *significantly* easier to use for small to medium sized businesses (these aren't your mom and pop stores on Main Street; think businesses that generate $10m+ in revenue). \n\nImportantly, many people have experienced Spotify, Shopify, Reddit, Discord, Amazon, etc going down. And the headlines often suggest that it was a result of an outage or something by Cloudflare. [This recent headline from TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/cloudflare-dns-goes-down-taking-a-large-piece-of-the-internet-with-it/), for instance, reads: \"*Cloudflare DNS goes down, taking a large piece of the internet with it\"*\n\nBut think about it ... so much of the internet relies on Cloudflare that when it experiences an issue, much of the internet is shut down as a result. That's pretty insane. \n\n**TLDR:** Buy Cloudflare.",

The company\u2019s brand appears to be \u201cgoing viral\u201d if a recent 150% spike in Google search volume is any indication. This would not be the first viral activity for PRPL following pioneering YouTube video advertisements a few years ago, but it represents an inflection to a formidable industry competitor. Indeed, our capacity analysis indicates that PRPL could have $1.3b in annualized revenue production exiting 2021, which would make it a top 6 brand. While it is too early to call PRPL\u2019s technology the next memory foam, which Tempur-Pedic (TPX, OUTPERFORM) developed and marketed to revolutionize the industry in the 1990s, it is gaining strong consumer acceptance and is growing much faster than Tempur-Pedic did. Moreover, the only consumer mattress licensee of the product, Intellibed, is looking for ways to further commercialize the technology by launching a line of gel matrix private label products at the leading retail mattress chain, Mattress Firm. As we detail inside, we see limited threat to PRPL from these products and given patent and trademark protections, as well as manufacturing complexities that create much higher costs for licensed gel matrix large layer producers, we see limited threats from future mattress products. Near-term, we remain comfortable with our above-consensus $180m 3Q20 revenue estimate, limited only by labor constraints in plants, lingering shipping delays, and a desire to adequately supply wholesale accounts to maintain relationships. Strong demand and a premium brand support limited promotions and price increases, which should help drive underlying (ex-growth investments) margin strength in 3Q20 and beyond. Finally, after InnoHold liquidated the last of its 13.6m (25%) share ownership in the secondary offering completed September 14, institutional ownership has likewise increased and an important overhang on shares has been removed. Accordingly, we increase our target price to $30 (from $27) and we reiterate our OUTPERFORM rating on shares of PRPL. \n\n Purple \u201cgoing viral\u201d? Google search volumes for Purple spiked during the weeks ending September 13 and September 20, to levels more than 150% y/y. While search volumes for all publicly traded mattress brands increased in the first week in September (likely due to the disruption from Hurricane Dorian during Labor Day of 2019) the trend continued to accelerate further as the month has continued only for PRPL. There has been no discernable shift in the company\u2019s marketing campaign this month that we can identify through the website, social media, or youtube video uploads that would point to a specific driver of such an inflection. In fact, promotional cadence has been limited and price increases appear to have met no resistance, as we believe PRPL continues to have material order backlogs. We view this trend positively for the brand. \n\n Manufacturing capacity, utilization and mix estimate drives $180m 3Q revenue estimate. We remind investors that PRPL\u2019s 7 th Mattress Max machine came online in June and has been fully operational throughout 3Q20. We estimate that each Mattress Max machine can produce \\~70k units annually, or \\~17.5k/quarter (the original Mattress Max machine is excluded from this, as it was built differently and exhibits a lower, estimated \\~50k annual yield, or 12.5k/quarter). With all 7 machines operating at 90% capacity this would equate to 420k annual units, or \\~105k/quarter. At an $2,000 average realized retail price and a 70%/30% mix between retail and wholesale (with retail realizing the average realized retail price in revenue per unit, and a wholesale unit generating half that) PRPL could generate $182m in mattress revenue in 3Q20, or $200m including non-mattress revenue, slightly above our $180m total revenue estimate; as capacity utilization may have been below 90% in 3Q20 due to labor constraints (leading to continued elevated order backlogs for both DTC and Wholesale), we are comfortable with our estimate (vs. consensus $173m), but see more upside than downside risk due to mix. PRPL is favoring DTC sales but is being sure to provide meaningful allocations to wholesale partners to maintain the relationships. Manufacturing capacity to grow sharply going forward; $1.3b annualized revenue potential exiting 2021. We take into account the company\u2019s announced plan for adding an 8 th Mattress Max machine to be fully operational in 2H20, as well as the plan to add four more machines through 2021 while decommissioning the first Mattress Max machine, to forecast annualized unit capacity expansion of +55% y/y by the end of 2021. At a 70% DTC/30% Wholesale revenue split and 100% capacity utilization this equates to a potential $104m in revenue potential per machine or $1.3b in potential annualized revenue for mattresses by the end of next year, or $1.2b with a split of 60% DTC/40% Wholesale. (Reducing capacity utilization to 90%, the company\u2019s target, and adding \\~10% revenue contribution from non-mattress products yields a similar total revenue potential estimate). Assuming demand continues to outpace supply, which is possible based on the sharply growing acceptance of the technology\u2019s high benefits vs. costs, this level of annualized revenue is  not out of the question. This compares to our revenue estimate of $780m and consensus\u2019 $790m estimate in 2021.",

As we detail inside, we see limited threat to PRPL from these products and given patent and trademark protections, as well as manufacturing complexities that create much higher costs for licensed gel matrix large layer producers, we see limited threats from future mattress products. Near-term, we remain comfortable with our above-consensus $180m 3Q20 revenue estimate, limited only by labor constraints in plants, lingering shipping delays, and a desire to adequately supply wholesale accounts to maintain relationships. Strong demand and a premium brand support limited promotions and price increases, which should help drive underlying (ex-growth investments) margin strength in 3Q20 and beyond. Finally, after InnoHold liquidated the last of its 13.6m (25%) share ownership in the secondary offering completed September 14, institutional ownership has likewise increased and an important overhang on shares has been removed. Accordingly, we increase our target price to $30 (from $27) and we reiterate our OUTPERFORM rating on shares of PRPL.\n\nPurple \u201cgoing viral\u201d? Google search volumes for Purple spiked during the weeks ending September 13 and September 20, to levels more than 150% y/y. While search volumes for all publicly traded mattress brands increased in the first week in September (likely due to the disruption from Hurricane Dorian during Labor Day of 2019) the trend continued to accelerate further as the month has continued only for PRPL. There has been no discernable shift in the company\u2019s marketing campaign this month that we can identify through the website, social media, or youtube video uploads that would point to a specific driver of such an inflection. In fact, promotional cadence has been limited and price increases appear to have met no resistance, as we believe PRPL continues to have material order backlogs. We view this trend positively for the brand.\n\nManufacturing capacity, utilization and mix estimate drives $180m 3Q revenue estimate. We remind investors that PRPL\u2019s 7 th Mattress Max machine came online in June and has been fully operational throughout 3Q20. We estimate that each Mattress Max machine can produce \\~70k units annually, or \\~17.5k/quarter (the original Mattress Max machine is excluded from this, as it was built differently and exhibits a lower, estimated \\~50k annual yield, or 12.5k/quarter). With all 7 machines operating at 90% capacity this would equate to 420k annual units, or \\~105k/quarter. At an $2,000 average realized retail price and a 70%/30% mix between retail and wholesale (with retail realizing the average realized retail price in revenue per unit, and a wholesale unit generating half that) PRPL could generate $182m in mattress revenue in 3Q20, or $200m including non-mattress revenue, slightly above our $180m total revenue estimate; as capacity utilization may have been below 90% in 3Q20 due to labor constraints (leading to continued elevated order backlogs for both DTC and Wholesale), we are comfortable with our estimate (vs. consensus $173m), but see more upside than downside risk due to mix. PRPL is favoring DTC sales but is being sure to provide meaningful allocations to wholesale partners to maintain the relationships. Manufacturing capacity to grow sharply going forward; $1.3b annualized revenue potential exiting 2021. We take into account the company\u2019s announced plan for adding an 8 th Mattress Max machine to be fully operational in 2H20, as well as the plan to add four more machines through 2021 while decommissioning the first Mattress Max machine, to forecast annualized unit capacity expansion of +55% y/y by the end of 2021. At a 70% DTC/30% Wholesale revenue split and 100% capacity utilization this equates to a potential $104m in revenue potential per machine or $1.3b in potential annualized revenue for mattresses by the end of next year, or $1.2b with a split of 60% DTC/40% Wholesale. (Reducing capacity utilization to 90%, the company\u2019s target, and adding \\~10% revenue contribution from non-mattress products yields a similar total revenue potential estimate). Assuming demand continues to outpace supply, which is possible based on the sharply growing acceptance of the technology\u2019s high benefits vs. costs, this level of annualized revenue is not out of the question. This compares to our revenue estimate of $780m and consensus\u2019 $790m estimate in 2021.",

        "selftext": "LLNW is up 20% since its bottom on September 9. It got hit just like FSLY and NET during the big sell off in early September. Since then, its bounced back 20% from a low of $5 back up to the $6 range. This stock is highly volatile, moving between gains of 80% to losses of 40% in the past 3 months. Its volatility seems tied to macro factors affecting perceived continued work-from-home.\n\nThe investor presentation for Q3 are here: https://s24.q4cdn.com/772370104/files/doc_presentations/Limelight_Networks_Investor_Presentation_Analyst_Day_July2020.pdf\n\nThe important things I was able to glean from this is their current mktcap and perceived growth. Their current mktcap is around $700M with a stock price of $6. They look like they have a really solid floor at $5, but a ceiling at $7-ish.\n\nTheir Q3 numbers weren't particularly spectacular: https://s24.q4cdn.com/772370104/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/Q2-2020-Financial-Schedule.pdf\n\nWhat does stand out is their gross profit is around 40%. Which seems low compared to other CDNs. For example, Cloudflare's gross margin is 77%: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200507005955/en/Cloudflare-Announces-First-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results\n\nI've seen posts on /r/stocks saying that LLNW is undervalued. And the graph that LLNW posts on their investor relations deck (data from 2019) has then low in revenue multiple per growth category. Which is good because they haven't run up yet comparatively.\n\nAgain, their revenue target for the year is about $232M, compared to $200M for all of 2019. Thats about a growth rate of 15%. But given their market cap is only $700M, thats a revenue to market cap multiplier of only ~3.02.\n\nI know its not apples to apples since Fastly is more of a hosting specialization company focusing on ease of use, but FSLY has revenue projections of $260M for 2020 (I got this number by taking their Q2 results and doubling it: https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/2Q20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) and is trading at market cap of 9.5B. The big difference is that FSLY operates are revenue margins of 58%. FSLY is also seeing growth of 50% YoY.\n\nSo LLNW definitely has headwinds in this market. They have lower gross margin and lower growth rates compared to the other hype company in this market.\n\nDoes anyone have insight into whether LLNW is a worthwhile investment that can overcome these two factors that seem to govern stock price of these cloud hosting companies?",
