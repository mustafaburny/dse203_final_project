        "selftext": "So in the last few days with markets dropping close to 30% there are clearly a few opportunities presenting once again!  \nOne of my biggest holdings right now is Hasbro HAS with a current 5% dividend yield a clear repositioning strategy within the entertainment business with Wizard of the Coast and Entertainment One. Additionally, being at almost 10 year lows and with the developed world now currently at the zero lower bond within the corporate market It is for sure one of my favorite stocks out there. Hasbro strategy is clearly making it stand out from the traditional struggling toy producer such as Mattel.  \n\n\nAdditionally, Autodesk ADSK and a few gaming stocks are some of my favorite picks!\n\n[https://youtu.be/Xk2VfbYyEHU](https://youtu.be/Xk2VfbYyEHU)",

I talked about this last week, longing the TVIX if the market tanked and if the 200 DMA didn't hold it would set up the next move lower. Right now the spy is sitting in a support zone with more support at 272 area. This is an extremely large gap for the market so likely there will huge ranges and choppiness. Since there are so many stocks gapping with the market, not many of which have catalyst, I will be concentrating on ETF's and stocks with good daily charts with room for price to move. If you are new to trading, pay attention and remember cash is a position. Only take the best setups with the best charts. Good luck out there and be careful, Huge gap days are usually the hardest to trade.",

But I'm wondering if, instead of selling more of my AMZN, AAPL, etc... if I short sold say a few tech stocks like ADBE, CRM, CRUS,  etc... if that would essentially act as a hedge for my longs with the reasoning that if my tech longs go down then most likely other tech stocks will as well and I'd make money by shorting them as I'm losing money on the longs. \n\n(I realize that I could buy puts as well, but I have never done that yet and am not familiar with that even though I did just get an options account.

Here's the watch list for today.\n\nGap Ups: DRAD, JNUG/NUGT, NNVC, NVAX, TVIX\n\nGap Downs: AAPL, AOBC, BYND, CSCO, CY, DAL, FB, JPM, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA\n\nPossible Day 2 Runners: TDOC, ZM, INO\n\nCorona Virus Related stocks: AHPI, CODX, INO, LAKE, MRNA, NNVC, TDOC, VIR\n\nThe market is gapping down pretty big which usually makes for a tough trading day. With that being said, there are plenty of stocks gapping today and most are gapping with the market. Had I included them all, this list would be ridiculously large so I picked what I thought were the best. Many times stocks will bounce at the open on a large gap like today but due to the extreme nature of the move, and also the SPY not holding the 200 DMA yesterday, we could see some continued selling pressure.\n\nMost airline stocks are extremely oversold and very extended so I didn't add them to my list. Yesterday I mentioned if the market tanked that I would long the TVIX, you can see today why I made that statement yesterday and the TVIX trade worked. However today is a new day. I will be very patient today, and wait for patterns. Days like today it's easy to get chopped up. For now temporary support on the SPY at 285, next after that is the 282 - 280 area. Good luck, be patient and be careful out there.",

Splunk sports a very high, but not astronomical PE, with decent profitability and a consistent record of beating earnings guidance. The recent acquisition (6 month) of SignalFx gives them further footprint in the booming cloud computing sector. An additional note is an announcement of a DoD contract with some huge numbers on it. While I cannot explain its actual effects, I do believe this is a positive for Splunk.\n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50 day averages and below 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 48, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and bullish open interest. Implied movement is 9.1% or about 13.85$ Short interest is at 4.6%, with 5.6 days to cover. One thing to note, the ATM straddle is actually getting cheaper, with a tiny IV contraction. While not a strong signal, I believe this is bullish for Splunk, as contracting IV is not a normality in current macro environments. The skew to call side reinforces this idea.\n\n**Sentimental**: Splunk has been beating and raising for more than 4 years. This track record of growth and performance weights positively. Analyst sentiments are bullish with a higher price target than SPLK\u2019s current price. Numerous partnerships with kings like AWS, CISCO, Accenture give Splunk a competitive moat. While not directly affected by the coronavirus, Splunk will need a massive win to command a big upward move. The main wildcard is the DoD deal updates, which can be a massive boost. Primary bear case is missing estimates and guiding lower.\n\n**Robinhood (3/4/2020) Less Fucky. Not using. Moving to Schwab this weekend.**\n\n**Put Credit Spread 3/13**\n\n**Buy 135 Put**\n\n**Sell 140 Put**\n\n**Everyone is into big data, cloud and becoming big brother without looking like big brother. Splunk is currently the leader in this sector and has minimal effects from current market fears**",

For example, buy two shares of Google only at $1,275, because that is the price I am willing to pay. If someone happens to sell on that day and also is willing to accept this price, there would be a deal. If no one accepts this price, it would be no deal.

Depositing all $75k into Fidelity but straight into a money market fund, and then DCAing (say 2k) from the money market fund each week into Fidelity S&amp;P500, in order to ask Fidelity for a signup bonus since I deposited all 75k at once into the brokerage account. (Not sure how much Fidelity would offer me\u2014anyone know?). \n\n2. Just setting up DCA (same 2k) per week from my savings account into Fidelity S&amp;P500.",

        "selftext": "What do you think is better approach to do a Roth IRA portfolio (given I am 30, single and newbie to all this)? I\u2019d like to pick funds and not mess with them (much or at all). I know approach 1 might sound like the way to go, since at Fidelity, this Fund might re-adjust weights as time goes by (that\u2019s what I hear). But I also like knowing the slices that are there in the portfolio and possibly investing in one more over the other at times.\n\n**Approach 1: Investing only in the Fidelity Freedom**\u00ae\u00a0**Index 2055 Fund (Target date fund)**\n\nThis one target date fund comprises of:-\n\n* Fidelity Series Total Market Index Fund\n* Fidelity\u00ae\u00a0Series Global Ex U.S. Index Fund\n* Fidelity\u00ae\u00a0Series Bond Index Fund\n* Fidelity\u00ae\u00a0Series Long-Term Treasury Bond Index Fund\n\n**Approach 2: Index funds - three fund portfolio**\n\n* US market: FSKAX or FZROX (I like FSKAX better)\n* International: FTIHX or FZILX (*IDK which is better. Thoughts?*)\n* Bonds: FXNAX\n\n**Approach 3: Go crazy with Index funds and do more DIY** \n\n* 30% in Domestic Stocks (FSKAX) \n* 15% in International Stocks (FSPSX) \n* 10% in Emerging Market Stocks (FPADX) \n* 15% in Real Estate Stocks (FSRNX) \n* 15% in U.S. Treasuries (FUAMX)\n* 15% in Fidelity Inflation-Protected Bond Index Fund (TIPS)\n\n**So, what is best? If Approach 2 or 3 then what re-adjustments are recommended.** \n\nThanks",
