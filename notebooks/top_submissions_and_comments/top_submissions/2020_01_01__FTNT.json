        "selftext": "Hi r/stocks, \n\nlast year I created a similar thread. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/anbr7e/first\\_year\\_into\\_stocks\\_summary\\_all\\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/anbr7e/first_year_into_stocks_summary_all_tech/)). I still follow buy and hold strategy and only sell stocks when I don't like certain changes in a company. Sometimes those decisions paid off, sometimes (AAPL) I missed out a bit (nevertheless I don't regret those decisions). \n\nAt some point I was down 30-50% on both NVDA and TSLA, I do strongly believe in both those companies and will not sell either of them in the next 5y for sure. Hitting a bigger number on the portfolio I started diversifying a bit as well. (MA,V,MRK)\n\nStrategy for 2020 is pretty simple for me, I'll invest mostly in AI and cybersececurity companies: First priority is to add a ton of Tencent. Highly recommend the book: \"AI Superpowers Book by Kai-Fu Lee\". imo there is no way around AI and probably Asia will be in the driving seat for the first time in 5-10y.\n\n**Be patient, don't panic sell, it might be swingy here and there but if you invest in strong companies it will pay off.** \n\nCurrent portfolio:\n\n* TSLA +56%\n* CRM +46%\n* FTNT +37%\n* MSFT +35%\n* AMZN +31%\n* MRK +9%\n* MA + 9%\n* NNND +8%\n* NVDA +7%\n* V +1%\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/6RJNKXU](https://imgur.com/a/6RJNKXU)",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve only been dabbling in invest for the past 12mths, and obviously with all the recession talk, China trade deal etc, I think everyone is a little nervous.\n\nBut ultimately I believe the world is becoming more of a cashless society, and it\u2019s so easy with mobile payments etc, I believe it\u2019s inevitable that this whole sector will sky rocket.\n\nI currently have positions in V , PYPL , SQ and taking more of a gamble on PAYS.\n\nI\u2019m looking for thoughts on  taking my positions in the above stocks noted, and investing in the IPAY ETF which would give me coverage on those stocks plus others like M, AXP, GPN, FIS, FISV, DFS and a few more?,\nOr Keep my individual stocks and add to my portfolio like M , GPN etc when or if they ever have a dip?\n\nAnd help would be greatly appreciated, cheers",

Great product and conservative targets this past year- which may mean great results at earnings. \n\nI currently hold several contracts for the 2/21 expiry and just cashed out of my 1/17 contracts with 100% gains since purchase on the 10th.",
