TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.\n\nThe main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **\"priced in\"**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.\n\nTA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.\n\nIntro to technical analysis by [Stockcharts chartschool](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#benefits_and_drawbacks_of_leading_indicators) and their [article on candlesticks](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:introduction_to_candlesticks)\n\nIf you have questions, please see the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Indicator - Trade Signals - Lagging Indicator - Leading Indicator - Oversold - Overbought - Divergence - Whipsaw - Resistance - Support - Breakout/Breakdown - Alerts - Trend line - Market Participants - Moving average - RSI - VWAP - MACD - ATR - Bollinger Bands - Ichimoku clouds - Methods - Trend Following - Fading - Channels - Patterns - Pivots](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/ta-themed-post)\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) Friday.",
