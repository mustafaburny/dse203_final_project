        "selftext": "Hi al.\n\n I have never given the stock market a try before , but with today's market I'm planning to get in as I have 70 thousand that Will not need for the next 5 years. \n\nThe market always looked very scary to me. It could be due to my father\u2019s continuous warnings to us when we were younger as he lost alot of money especially during the 08-09 crisis. \n\nCould you please advise on the below strategy. \n\nI'm planning to divide my money between the following \n\n- Microsoft\n- Google\n- apple\n- FB \n- Intel\n- Canadian big 5 banks \n- JPM \n- JNJ \n- KHC \n- Pepsi \n- Cocacola \n- PG\n- SBUX \n- Mcdonald\n- BRK.C \n- NKE \n- Disney \n- S&amp;amp;P , Nasdaq , TSX and Dow jones ETF\u2019s \n- lastly will put smaller amount of money into       these risky stocks ( Uber , AC, LUV, XOM, ENB)\n\nMy family advised me to ask an advisor but I don't think there is much he/she could offer me beside taking a percentage? These options sound to me like solid investments that will return my money for sure in 5 years with a good profit? I'm I right ? What do u guys think ? Any additional stocks u recommend or maybe some stocks to remove? \n\nOf course I missed the greatest chance when the market bottomed as it took time to open my an account with an online broker :( \n\n I'm not intending to buy now and my entry point would be when the markets  drop 300-500 points then I buy more gradually if market continue to drop? \n\nDoes this sounds like a plan to you guys? \n\nThanks for all your input",

        "selftext": "The Nasdaq is basically flat year to date. All the FAANG stocks are near all time highs. Facebook, Netflix and Google all missed on EPS estimates. Apple is likely to be hit even worse (sales are down and stores are closed) which leaves Amazon as the only member of FAANG that is likely to beat on earnings.\n\nHere's the thing, according to earnings calls and the current economic trend, they were only beginning to experience negative effects for the last few weeks of the quarter. GDP declined by 4.8% this quarter, whereas economists are projecting a decline of 30% to 40% next quarter. \n\nIf we look at tech across the board, we have some winners like Microsoft and Zoom, but chip makers like AMD (which met EPS estimates but didn't beat) and Qualcom both delivered poor guidance for coming quarters. AMD has been rallying back to all time highs. Nvidia is also near all time highs. Yet, despite the relative strength in the tech sector, the current trend of earnings, economic forecasts and guidance (or lack thereof) strongly suggests that tech will take a huge hit to earnings in coming quarters.\n\nLet's look at how concentrated the S&amp;P is in the very top tech stocks [https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg) This blows the dot com boom out of the water. Now consider how much of the S&amp;P the rest of the tech stocks account for.\n\nAll of this is to say, watch these tech stocks closely.  If they fall, the indexes will go with them. There is a high probability they will lead the next leg of the drop.\n\nAlso, here's my take on the long term value of these stocks. The US is moving closer and closer towards adopting basic income. Nothing is guaranteed, but if anything has made the case for increased automation coupled with basic income, it's the current circumstance. Such a policy would likely necessitate a rise in corporate taxes or a VAT. That's a direct hit to earnings of notorious tax evaders like Amazon. In addition, basic income would give working class people more leverage in holding out for higher pay because they wouldn't be weighing job offers against total destitution. This too would detract heavily from future earnings.\n\nAfter the 2000 crash, the Nasdaq didn't recover to the highs for 15 years. If you look at that S&amp;P chart I posted, two of the top five stocks were Microsoft and Intel. Microsoft took 16 years to recover to its highs and Intel never full recovered.\n\nTherefor, I advise extreme caution in this environment. Do not be shamed out of taking profits near all time highs if that's what you personally feel comfortable with. I won't say it's wrong to hold if you're ready to accept the risk, however, just because these companies are good \"blue chips stocks\" that doesn't mean that they're low risk or no risk, regardless of your time horizon. That's just my two cents.",

Apple\u2019s ARM Mac chips in development are based on the A14 processor coming to the iPhone and iPad this year and next year respectively. \n\n**My Personal Thoughts:**\n\nThe writing has been on the wall for some time at this point with respect to Apple and Intel. In 2010, Apple went with its own mobile processor for the iPhone. In 2016, it started doing its own Mac security/power processors (T1/T2). Later this year, Apple is replacing Intel with its own modems. \n\nOne of the foundational aspects of Apple has always been its core desire to control 100% of its stack from top to bottom, sometimes at the detriment or some might say \"exploitation\" of its vendors. \n\nMy personal take on it, at least from what I've seen, is that Apple has an extraordinary level of perfectionism that it expects of itself and by association, its vendors too. As long vendors can continue to meet the onerous demands that Apple places on them, they'll be safe. Apple internally, however, will be working on their own in-house version of the hardware, and the moment things start to degrade in quality or Apple becomes unsatisfied with performance, there is absolutely no hesitation in axing them off. \n\nThe relationship between Apple and Intel as a vendor has generally always been pretty good. Intel was able to meet the expectations that Apple asked for year after year, until of course, at some point a catalyst occurred that made Apple decide it was time to make the switch. In my opinion, this was a result of Intel's exceptional failure in managing to get its 10nm process working. Originally expected to be completed by 2014, for the past six years, Intel has had been unable to get 10nm working, effectively having to with re-release processors every year from its old 14nm platform. \n\nIf I had to make a guess as to when the breaking point was reached in terms of Apple deciding that it's relationship with Intel was no longer working out, it would probably be around 2016, when Intel released it's 7th generation Kaby Lake \"14nm+\" processors.\n\nFor any of your that have followed along these past few years in this space, I'd be curious as what your thoughts are. Though I think I've built up a pretty good picture, I'm sure there are some things I'm missing.",

There are **tons** of different gap trading strategies, some of which allow you to profit from them going up from buying and selling and others that allow you to profit from them going down from short-selling and covering.\n\n**Example 1**: Some stocks will gap up and continue running throughout the day\u2026 known as a \u201cgap and go.\u201d These make great buy opportunities. Not all gap ups will gap and go, but you can use both fundamental and technical analysis to find ones with the highest probability of doing so.\n\n**Example 2**: Other gap ups will come straight back down at the open. These are usually stocks with poor fundamentals and a history or dilution/offerings. If you have an account with a broker that allows short-selling, these often make great short opportunities that allow you to profit from them coming back down after they gap up.\n\n**Example 3**: A lot gap downs will become very oversold and end up bouncing back up a bit after the market opens. Depending on the news and the individual company, gap downs can offer a great opportunity to get shares at a discount before a bounce.\n\nAt the end of the day, I hope this just shows that I am **not** posting these to show what has been missed out on, but to hopefully give some good day trade opportunities.

        "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices is likely to post strong results when the company announces first-quarter earnings after the close of trading on Tuesday.\n\nFor the quarter, the company (ticker: AMD) previously projected revenue of $1.8 billion, up 42% from a year ago. The consensus among Wall Street analysts calls for $1.78 billion in revenue and profits of 18 cents a share.\n\nAMD rival\u2019s Intel (INTC) last week reported better-than-expected March quarter results, driven by strength in both the personal-computer and cloud-server sectors. The memory-chip producer Micron Technology (MU) likewise recently reported strong results, driven by both PC and server demand.\n\nIn Intel\u2019s case, investors had a mixed reaction to the news, largely because of concerns about the outlook. Intel withdrew its previous financial forecasts for the full year, citing uncertainties tied to the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated financial downturn. Intel also cautioned that tailwinds boosting sales of PCs and servers in the first quarter were likely to fade in the second half of the year, due in part to a likely slowing of corporate spending.\n\nOne key question will be whether AMD maintains its current forecast for revenue for the full year, which calls revenue growth of 28%-30%. The Wall Street consensus, for $8.6 billion in sales, implies growth of 27.7%, slightly below the target range\n\nFor the second quarter, the consensus view is that revenue will total $1.92 billion and that per-share earnings will be 21 cents.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/amd-reports-earnings-tuesday-heres-what-to-expect-51588019021",

        "selftext": "Some points I am thinking about....\n\n\\- AMD currently has a P/E ratio of 161.27. This is ridiculously high and easy to label as overpriced. However, their earnings are being utilized towards captial investments (growth in their lineup) which is an explanation for a high P/E but not necessarily a \"bad\" stock \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am not a big gamer, but from taking a poll of approximately 100 gamers (I know not a lot) the big consensus is that they have high performing products that is significantly cheaper than its competitors (INTEL). This is great for now, but I take this as a subjective measure of potential growth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Their financials IMO are not bad. They have a great steady growth, and I have some positions at $10. However, I see a lot of arguments saying their fair value is like $20. What is that? I know what a fair value is, but how are people speculating this value without any backup? I feel like people are throwing a lot of prices of what they think is fair but not giving much information. I can guess they are just seeing the P/E ratio and just cutting the current value of the stock by some mentally established value.\n\n\\- As meme stock as it is, this was the same mindset when this stock was in the low 10ish. Then it shot up like crazy in the last few years. Why? I speculate it is because AMD is strongly based on the growth potential and opinion of the users rather than their financially evaluated value. \n\nAll that said, I see them as speculative growth in the future and customer based. Going off of these indicators, I don't see anything that debases or devalues their speculative growth or their customer base! I feel bullish on AMD. \n\nI am no professional in any capacity. Just calling it from how I see it based on my own research. I'd appreciate constructive input.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: This would be a part of my fun portfolio (10% of all my holdings is my fun portfoilio and I plan to make AMD 20 percent of that at my next dip opportunity). I anticipate  my next buying opportunity after Q1 earnings on May 5th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, have a good day and wash your hands.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020.\n\n# **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.\n*****\n&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. \u201cThe data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.\u201d As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.\n*****\n&gt; Charts are important\n&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday\u2019s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.\n*****\n&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen\u2019s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there\u2019s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. \u201cThe market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. \u201cWe\u2019re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. \u201cPart of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that\u2019s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,\u201d said Doll.\n*****\n&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIts going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,\u201d he said, \u201cThis one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that\u2019s defensive in nature is going to perform well.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy\u2019s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.\n*****\n&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.\n*****\n&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,\u201d said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey won\u2019t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that window will close, and we\u2019ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there\u2019s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a reflection of physical market conditions,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu\n\n&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).\n\n&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**\n\n&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term\n\n&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**\n\n&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It\u2019s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn\u2019t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.\n\n&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn\u2019t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won\u2019t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish\n\n&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA\u2019s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.\n\n&gt; April\u2019s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/826c536dba71629e9d1a26329db32eba/97c8d036ee5ba87c-9b/s500x750/55708144eea7c12b24adf731e9dc63e41e31604b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$BOH** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$TFC** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$SNA** \n&gt; * **$LVS** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$KALU** \n&gt; * **$EMR** \n&gt; * **$CIT** \n&gt; * **$FITB**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zBd2gQL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/25QY7uo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzAy7Pk.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xjSoWZ3.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RbwZ1le.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjS7QnD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY4wQPz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/F2u6ejr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QW6sJiO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gylBF9c.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vwNztBG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $422.96\n&gt; **Netflix, Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020.\n\n# **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.\n*****\n&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. \u201cThe data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.\u201d As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.\n*****\n&gt; Charts are important\n&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday\u2019s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.\n*****\n&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen\u2019s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there\u2019s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. \u201cThe market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. \u201cWe\u2019re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. \u201cPart of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that\u2019s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,\u201d said Doll.\n*****\n&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIts going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,\u201d he said, \u201cThis one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that\u2019s defensive in nature is going to perform well.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy\u2019s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.\n*****\n&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.\n*****\n&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,\u201d said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey won\u2019t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that window will close, and we\u2019ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there\u2019s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a reflection of physical market conditions,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu\n\n&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).\n\n&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**\n\n&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term\n\n&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**\n\n&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It\u2019s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn\u2019t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.\n\n&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn\u2019t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won\u2019t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish\n\n&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA\u2019s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.\n\n&gt; April\u2019s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/826c536dba71629e9d1a26329db32eba/97c8d036ee5ba87c-9b/s500x750/55708144eea7c12b24adf731e9dc63e41e31604b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 17th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl9EH42Ldgc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.19.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$BOH** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$TFC** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$SNA** \n&gt; * **$LVS** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$KALU** \n&gt; * **$EMR** \n&gt; * **$CIT** \n&gt; * **$FITB**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zBd2gQL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/25QY7uo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzAy7Pk.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xjSoWZ3.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RbwZ1le.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjS7QnD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY4wQPz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/F2u6ejr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QW6sJiO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gylBF9c.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vwNztBG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $422.96\n&gt; **Netflix, Inc.

What are the earnings and growth opportunities, we are expecting for next 1- 5 years.\n\nI think, AMZN has lot of growth potential with all in one package (retail, fmcg, Streaming and AWS). How big AWS going to be in terms of contributing AMZN market cap.\n\nAAPL has still long way to go in terms of selling phones and other stuff. They are like windows of mobile phones. They are even replacing windows in laptops. They own mobile domain.\n\nGOOG has lot of ad revenues. I am not too sure about all the other stuff they do.\n\nI am not sure about MSFT story. It is growing into cloud space. They missed big time in mobile space like Intel. They have strong office suit and windows. I think, they have big windows stack/servers for enterprise applications.\n\nI am also thinking about COSTCO. It has nice concept of selling limited skus in big quantities. It has its own private label which can be as big as P&amp;G.\n\nAm i understanding these stories correctly?

It has become clear to me that although the Fed is doing its best to support the economy and continue the upward trend, there is much to consider for the bear market case.\n\nThat said, I would like to outline what I feel are the best purchases available for the near future, including discussions of P/E, Cash on hand, sustainability and forward viability.\n\n\nAlthough many companies have taken a massive hit over the past month, some continue to succeed, even by bear market standards. For example, the tech industry is particularly well suited to beat the overarching bear market sentiment. Most tech companies have lots of capital on hand to withstand the downturn, case in point: \n\n\n**TECH**\n\n\nThe following companies posted the following relevant statistics:\n(All P/E given in 2019 numbers)\n\nApple: \nCash on hand: 207B \n-- CFRA 12 month target $320\n-- Current share price: $260\n\n\nMSFT: \nCash on hand: 136B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $197\n-- Current share price: $164\n\n\nAlphabet: \nCash on hand: 117B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $1761\n-- Current share price: $1187\n\n\nAmazon: \nCash on hand: 44B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $2400\n-- Current share price: $2100.59\n\n\nIntel: \nCash on hand: 13.4B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $70\n-- Current share price: $58.38\n\n\nDell: \nCash on hand: 8.15B \n-- Morningstar fair market value: $65\n-- Current share price: $38.37\n\n\nAMD: \nCash on hand: 1.5B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $53\n-- Current share price: $47.54\n**Increasing market share vs Intel and Nvidia\n\n\nNvidia: \nCash on hand: 1.08B \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $300\n-- Current share price: $258.95\n\n\nSupplier for 7nm tech:\n\n\nTSM: \nCash on hand: 594M \n-- CFRA 12 month target: $63\n-- Current share price: $49.73\n\n\nSamsung: Private\n\n\n**Chinese semiconductor suppliers that have unverified credentials\n\n\n**OIL**\n\nAlthough the situation with oil is currently incredibly volatile pending deals between the KSA, Russia and the United States, I felt given the recent demise of West Texas Intermediate futures prices of over 50%, it would be prudent to note the companies most likely to weather the storm, as well as potential benefactors given debt status and income level.\n\n\nExxon Mobil:\nCash on hand: 6.6B FY19\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $41\n-- Current share price: $41.23\n-- P/E - 24.9 - 19.7\n\n\nChevron:\nCash on hand: 7M\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $98\n-- Current share price: $80.90\n-- P/E - 82.7 - 69.5\n\n\nOccidental Petroleum: \nCash on hand: Approx 1B\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $13\n-- Current share price: $13.83\n-- P/E - 16.4 - 10.5 (2018)\n**It should be noted OXY has an estimated 6.3B in debt due in 2021, but is saving 4.3B in cash for dues. OXY is cash flow negative for oil production at this time.\n\n\nDevon Energy Corporation:\nCash on hand: 32M\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $23\n-- Current share price: $8.70\n-- P/E - 44.3 - 19.4 (2018)\n\n\n**Hospitality**\n\nCarnival Cruise Lines:\nCash on hand: 7M\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $43\n-- Current share price: $11.27\n-- P/E - 14.2 - 9.2 \n**CCL recently took a 10% purchase from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia valued at more than 300M\n\n\nRoyal Carribean Cruises LTD:\nCash on hand: 6.6B FY19\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $100\n-- Current share price: $33.56\n-- P/E - 15.0 - 10.3\n\n\nHilton Worldwide Holdings:\nCash on hand: 3.3B FY19\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $120\n-- Current share price: $65.93\n-- P/E - 37.1 - 22.1\n\n\nMGM Resorts Intl:\nCash on hand: 2.04B FY19\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $30\n-- Current share price: $13.63\n-- P/E - 8.7 - 6.1\n\n\nLas Vegas Sands:\nCash on hand: 2.29B FY19\n-- CFRA 12 month target: $62\n-- Current share price: $42.67\n-- P/E - 20.1 - 14.5\n\n\n\n**My Personal Purchases**\n\nI will be purchasing/have purchased the following stocks at what I will include as a good price (to me):\n\nAMD: $43\nMSFT: $140\nNVDA: $240\nXOM: $40\nOXY: $10\nMGM: $11\nHLT: $45\nCCL: $9\nDIS: $90\n\n\nI will add that as holding a bearish outlook, I do not feel we are near the bottom. I plan to make increasingly aggressive purchases on what I feel will be a leg down to 2000 S&amp;P. That said, I am still committing around 1-2% of my available cash for purchasing stock I feel is decidedly undervalued but likely to survive/succeed.\n\nIf there are any questions, feel free to provide them. I will also accept request for statistics on companies I feel would be a good value. The choices for these companies' inclusion is my personal opinion and I am not a financial advisor.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I am sitting on just under 10,000 in cash that I made from some options YOLOs (up over 500%, shout out r/wallstreetbets) but after few small losses and seeing how much money people on there lost, made me realize how unsustainable that kind of investing (gambling) was. I was on Robinhood but recently opened a Schwab Roth IRA and I am looking to keep 5,000 + money I make in the next few months in either one of those and save the rest for college next year. However I am still considering a high-risk strategy with a combination of 50% ETFs (QQQ, VOO), 25% MSFT and INTC stock I already have with my dad, and 25% LEAP calls in MSFT, AMD, and XOM (once VIX settles down). Considering my strategy and risk tolerance UI I was wondering which platform would be better for me?\n\nFeel free to critique my plan too lol\n\nTLDR; Is it better for an 18-year-old to hold high-risk, high-reward positions in a Schwab roth IRA or obviously taxed Robinhood.",

        "selftext": "\n \n \nOIL Rebounds!\n \nStocks Rally\n \nSeveral Solid Earnings Surprises\n \n \nAs I said in my closing comment (below) there were 3 legs to the stool that supported the market today, oil, earnings, and strong futures.  The market in the oil was up a little, down a little, but when the futures rallied off the $10.00 level and moved to as high as $16.18, the turn in the market was right there following it.  We finished with the DJIA +456.94 (1.99%), NASDAQ +232.15 (2.81%), S&amp;P 500 +62.75 (2.29%), the Russell +16.43 (1.39%) and the DJ Transports (the only loser -3.78 (.05%).  There were only 3 DJIA names lower and only single digits with the gainers MCD +61, AAPL +53, V +40, MSFT +39, and INTC and HD adding 25 DPs.\nVolume was a little light with A/D 2.5:1 on NYSE and 2.2:1 on NASDAQ.  The NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) was the strongest mover with energy number 2.  Consumer staples and financials were weak.  \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video\nhttps://youtu.be/YOGWiIDX-sM\n \nSECTORS: Earnings were a feature again with SNAP continuing higher after last night\u2019s numbers and finishing $17.01 +4.57 (37%).  TXN finished +5.14 (4.8%), and the biggest winner was CMG +95.57 (12.2%) on an earnings beat and a monster gain in digital business.\n \nExpedia (EXPE) is being courted by 2 private equity firms for a $1 Billion investment.  The stock is down from $144 last year to hit $40.76 in March but finished the day $61.42 +4.17 after trading as high as $64.12.  I\u2019m sure that these two firms are much smarter than I, but I can\u2019t see the upside for a very long time.  When restaurants reopen, capacity will be cut, same for hotels and cruise ships.  I have no idea how long planes will be required to fly with smaller loads, but there are just too many \u201cunknowns\u201d to plunk $1 billion down for hospitalities.  Just saying.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with the big exception being BIIB.  It finished \u2013 31.51 (9.58%) on the news that its Alzheimer\u2019s drug will be delayed.  ABBV +1.42, REGN +13.26, ISRG +15.50, GILD +3.07, MYL -.21, TEVA +.05, VRTX +6.57, BHC +.24, INCY +1.51, ICPT -.14, LABU +1.96 and IBB $124.16 +1.74 (1.42%)\n \nCANNABIS: This group was MIXED with TLRY +.09, CGC -.14, CRON -.04, GWPH -1.40, ACB -.003, PYX -.09, NBEV +.03, CURLF +.015, KERN +.25 and MJ $11.50 +.21 (1.86%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +9.43, RTX +.80, GD +3.31, TXT +.46, NOC +8.83, BWXT +.94, TDY +6.37 and ITA $148.20 +.74 (.50%).\n \n  \nRETAIL: was LOWER with the exception of the discounters.  M -.35, JWN -.48, KSS -1.00, DDS -2.36 (9.16%), JCP -.008, WMT +2.70, TGT +.09, TJX +.35, RL -.32, UAA +.14, LULU -5.37, TPR -.25, CPRI -.35 and XRT $33.19 +.11 (.33%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with only NFLX down $12.94 (2.98%) on its earnings miss.  GOOGL +43.94, AMZN +31.88, AAPL +7.58, FB +11.52 (6.74%), NVDA +15.02, TSLA +43.28 (6.3%), BABA +2.99, BIDU +.01, CMG continuing higher in extended hours +104.37 (13.27%), BA -.48, CAT +1.03, DIS +.76, and\nXLK $87.30 +3.15 (3.74%).\n \n  \nFINANCIALS were SLIGHTLY HIGHER with GS +2.23, JPM +.37, BAC +.16, MS +.90, C +.67 PNC unchanged, AIG +.04, TRV +.01, AXP +.81, V +6.05, and XLF $21.56 +.27 (1.27%).\n \nOIL, $13.78 +2.21. Oil was the BIGGEST STORY of the day again with the June contract taking over and recovering from what was surely forced liquidation in May.  Remember, that this will happen again unless the market improves before May 19th.  Oil stocks were higher with APA + .85 (9.92%) and HES +3.01 (8.28%) and XLE $33.50 +1.19 (3.68%).\n \n  \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,738.00 +50.5 After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. Tuesday night it fell and hit $1,666 before coming back up $20. Today it rallied hard and I still expect much higher prices.  We are long NEM.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $7115 + 225. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we\u2019d have to test 6750 and today we hit 6465 before turning back up.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.70 +.26 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m having a bit of a dilemma choosing between these two stocks. INTC vs TSM.\n\nThey are not direct competitors, but TSMC manufactures chips for Intel\u2019s competitor AMD. They also have big clients like Apple and Nvidia. They also have the edge in terms of manufacturing technology and are already projecting the production of 5 and 3nm chips.\n\nOn the other hand, intel designs and manufactures its chips, and had multiple delays for the 10 and 7nm chips. However with all the means they have they can very well mark a come back and become more attractive in terms of innovation. Plus, I think their stock is \u201csafer\u201d and less cyclical than TSMC.\n\nBoth their balance sheets look healthy to me.\n\nI would love to hear your opinions, and what would be your recommandation between the two stocks.\n\nThank you very much!",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading April 13th\n \n \nStocks Rally, Again\n \nOil Fails on Cutbacks\n \n \nToday was another day in which the market rallied on bad news.  First time unemployment claims were 6.6 million vs the 5 million expectations, a big number by itself.  The FED hit the market with it\u2019s announcement of a new $2.3 TRILLION of emergency lending to businesses and municipalities.  The UK announced its plan to fund their fiscal needs and in Germany, Merkel rejected the Italians demand for a joint euro debt deal.  U. of Michigan Consumer Sentiment fell sharply to 71 vs. 89 in March and the consensus of 79.3.  The DJIA finished +285.80 (1.22%), NASDAQ +62.68 (.77%), S&amp;P 500 +39.84 (1.45%) the Russell again beat all others at +55.06 (4.62%) while the DJ Transports were +84.53 (1.04%).  Market internals were 5.5:1 on NYSE and 3:1 NASDAQ.  Volume was light again, but on a pre-holiday trading day that\u2019s par for the course.  Financials, real estate and Industrials were strong and Health care, technology and communication services weak.  DJIA were 19 up and 11 lower with no triple-digit gainers or losers.  JPM +58, GS +50, HD +49, and MCD +42 DPs, while UNH -22, jnj -14 and INTC -13 DPs.  \nTonight\u2019s Closing Commentary is available https://youtu.be/O7pZP678FZs\n \nThere was also an excellent interview on CNBC HalfTime with Chamath Palihapitiya about bailouts and the American public that I\u2019ve added.  I think it\u2019s especially interesting given that he is not a politician, but rather a venture capitalist.  https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/chamath-palihapitiya-us-needs-to-let-hedge-funds-billionaires-fail.html\nBesides this portion of the interview Chamath discusses that if the government wants to help \u201cpeople\u201d and make them even, they should take their last years W2 and pay them monthly what they earned last year and not to support the banks by taking illiquid assets off their balance sheets.\n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1800 members.\n \nSECTORS:\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was MIXED with BIIB +3.05, ABBV +1.49, REGN +.63, ISRG -5.71, MYL +.85, TEVA +.34, VRTX -2.66, BHC +2.42 (15.43%), INCY -.94, ICPT +2.21, LABU +1.41 AND IBB $113.98 +1.04 (.92%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: This group was MIXED with TLRY -.12, CGC -.23, CRON -.27, GWPH -1.32, ACB +.03, PYX +.30, NBEV -.03, CURLF +.06, KERN +.14, and MJ $11.45 +.14 (1.34%).\n \n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +13.59, RTX +2.88, GD +4.11, TXT +1.55, NOC +7.33, BWXT +.85, TDY -1.23 and ITA $156.00 +5.05 (3.35%).\n \n \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M +.91, JWN +2.68, KSS +3.08, DDS +.01, JCP +.025, WMT +.24, TGT -.23, TJX -.11, RL +4.25 (5.58%), UAA +.75, LULU +7.50, TPR +.93, CPRI -.08 and XRT $33.55 +1.17 (3.61%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were MIXED with GOOGL +1.00, AMZN +5.22, AAPL +3.08, FB +1.09, NFLX +.84, NVDA -2.70, TSLA +45.66 (8.32%), BABA -.08, BIDU +1.67, BA +8.63 (5.88%), CAT -1.50, DIS +4.48 and XLK $85.20 +.02 (.02%).\n \n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +8.44, JPM +9.50 (10.07%), BAC +1.64, MS +1.90, C +3.74, PNC +6.50, AIG +2.42, TRV +4.97, AXP +3.42 and XLF $23.38 +1.19 (5.36%).\n \n \nOIL, $22.76 -2.33. Oil started the day with the announcement that Russia and Saudi\u2019s were in agreement about a cut in production of \u201cup to\u201d 20 million barrels/day.  Later in the day the WSJ reported that the cuts were not as reported and involved cuts of only half that and only for a limited period of time.  Prices had been higher by almost 13% before the reversal which sent priced -7%.  In all of history, oil has only had this size range 3 times and 2 of those times were this month.  Oil stocks were higher and XLE finished $34.75 +.53 (1.55%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,752.80 +68.50. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1742 before falling back to close $60 off the highs and below $1700.  Today was a major move to the upside and the close is the highest since September 2012 and sets up a move towards the highs at $1,800 from 2011.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $7,290 -45. After we traded in a short-range day followed by a $1,000 range on Friday BTC closed above $7,000 for the first time since it broke to the downside early last month.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.80 -.05 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

But I am more bullish on the order.  Yeah - the economy is down yada yada yada- but listen, most TSLA buyers are tech savvy. IBM killed cloud services last week so did intel in data services. That means that commission check needs to be spent y\u2019all. \n\nBA - is the largest exporter of US dollar wise. Good news/bad news I think it will go up bto cause if Powell- somehow they will find a way to bump this shit up. It\u2019s American symbol of success.  \n\nNFLX. Yeah they are hiring left right for warehouse and stuff but that is expected maybe even priced in- NFLX 15 mil news subs cause they stuck at home. Most also would like to get their product shipped quicker so sign for prime membership. If 1/3 of NFLX sign prime yearly (5 mil) that alone is about 1.7$ per share gain. \n\nBut the money is in the cloud services- Zoom and NFLX use amazon cloud. And from why TSLA will explode you saw how intel and ibm did on the AWS core business. So yeah I am very bullish. \n\nWhat are your thoughts",

        "selftext": "fellow autists, I know I'm not the only retard tired of losing tendies despite $SPY moving lower. well i was scrolling the sub this morning and got inspired by a post (can't find it, will edit in link if I can later) that basically said stop betting against the SPY, start betting against certain companies that actually make up the SPY (also, stop buying fucking FD's, start buying further out puts that are close to ITM) so I made myself a cup of coffee, watched my girl get fucked by her ex boyfriend and his brother, did a lot of math, looked at a bunch of charts, and now I have *the* company to bet against here.\n\nfirst, lets talk about what happened last week. daddy blew a ~~tweet~~ firework up the oil industry's ass, leading to the biggest one-day increase in oil price history. you know whats happened every single time the oil industry has its biggest one-day increase in oil price? it fucking goes down. every. single. time. -17.21% on average before a bottom was reached. average of 79 calendar days to that bottom. \n\nyou know what also happened? $IWM hit lows that it hasn't seen since 2016. it's down 30.72% since March 5th. $SPY is down 19.78% since March 5th. what's that tell us? small businesses are fucked basically. we knew that already though, right? I mean, it's this subs favorite catch phrase \"it's already priced in you retard\" well in this case, yea, it is. on $IWM. it's not totally priced into SPY. you know what though? the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bcomes for everyone eventually. if $SPX were to hit 2016 lows, it'd be at 2075. that's another -16.62% to fall.\n\nanyone ever heard of the 60/40 balanced portfolio? none of you fucking autists probably have, but that's alright. it's a retirement fund made up of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. who cares, right? well actually, it just dropped 20% of peak value for the fourth time in 75 years. what happened those other three times? glad you asked. an average of -12.16% to the low in an average of 27 calendar days.\n\nwhat does this all tell us? for starters, stop betting for/against $IWM. there's no tendies to be made there. but the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bhere have a point, things are looking grim and we're not close to the bottom yet. the problem is you're all getting theta/IV fucked into oblivion because you just fucking NEED that screenshot now and can't trade anything other than SPY \n\nso what exactly can we do with this information? well instead of hoping jpow's printer finally runs out of some fucking ink, we can seek out a vulnerable company...\n\n1. that is down since 3/5 but not down as much as $SPY \n2. is in a vulnerable industry\n3. trades on good volume\n\nlook no further than $AMD. semiconductors are notoriously one of the first to move when the market flips. unlike it's competitors $NVDA and $INTC, they don't have a cloud-computing business. they sell computer chips (APUs and GPUs). the stock is down -11.47% since 3/5. that trails SPY's fall by 8.31%. it jumped up a bit on 3/24 with just about every other tech stock, but it tumbled 4.27% on Friday. they're set to report earnings around the last week of April but they rarely surprise and don't move much on earnings in general. if we're trailing SPY by \\~8% AND we think there's an additional \\~12% to go, there's a lot of upside in the downside here. since we're trailing SPY by about 8%, let's conservatively say there's only 12% left for AMD to move to the downside (instead of \\~20%) a 12% decrease in the stock price would be \\~$37.50 \n\ntl;dr: the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bcomes for everyone, stop betting against SPY, start betting against AMD. it's going down and you can get right on an ITM strike at a relatively cheap price with good volume and a low-ish (low 60s) IV\n\n$AMD 6/19 42p",

        "selftext": "Hey guys! Earnings season is up. I have tried a premium selling strategy that has worked for me pretty well for at least more than an year. The strategy is a simple put credit spread. And you do it on the companies that have a history of beating revenues, companies that have a strong management, etc. Sure, these companies can also take a dip if they miss their estimates but they tend to come back up after sometime. Examples for such companies might be FAANG+Microsoft. To protect my downside, I go out in the 45 DTE monthly, give up some premium collected and go far out to 2X the expected move. It gives me a little more room to the downside and enough time to recoup losses if the trade goes against me. \n\nI have made a list of such companies.

With the trope of, '\"if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything\", I think it's pretty clear Intel expects earnings to decline later into the year. \n\nThough the coronavirus is definitely a key driver in dampening things, I think the ongoing issues Intel has been facing with respect to losing its process lead due to their difficulty with 10nm, is the more primary concern long term. What used to be an advantage has now largely become a liability as companies like AMD, Nvidia, and Apple have chosen to focus on design while reaping the benefits of TSMC's continuous process improvements effectively for free.\n\nImportant things to look for and potential catalysts I see that are important to Intel's future\n\n1) Intel's ramp up to their 7nm process. With TSMC's 5nm process already in production, they cannot afford to have another failure like their 10nm process was.\n\n2) Proliferation of ARM architecture, primarily looking at any news from companies like Apple making the switch for their laptops to their own in-house processors.",

        "selftext": "\n \n \nOIL Rebound Continues!\n \nStock Rally Falls Short\n \nINTC Beats, But Poor Guidance\n \n \nToday\u2019s market looked a little better than I thought it should with the 3rd day out of 5 trying to move over the 50-day MA and failed.  While the DJIA was +39.44 (.17%), the only other gainer was the Russell +12.54 (1.04%) with NASDAQ -.63 (.01%) and S&amp;P 500 -1.51 (.05%).  The DJ Transports were + 39.44 (.17%), but also near the lows.  Market internals were positive at 1:6:1 on NYSE and 5:3 on NASDAQ.  Volume was in line with the past several days.  Energy, industrials and communication services were strong and consumer staples, real estate and utilities were the weak sisters.  The DJIA was 15 down, 14 up and PG unchanged.  The big losers were MCD -31 and WMT \u2013 21DPs with UNH +55 and BA +20 DPs.  In the news today we had new initial claims for unemployment jumped 810,000 to 4.42 million and new home sales were down 15.4%, and slightly worse than expected.\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7H9RpWfLlo  Enjoy!!\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video\nhttps://youtu.be/mAsxHW461e8\n \n \nSECTORS: Earnings were a feature again with INTC the big name after today\u2019s close and although there was a beat on both top and bottom lines, guidance was a disappointment and the stock, which has rallied off the lows near $44 to close today $59.04 -1.06 fell further to trade $55.26 and is currently $55.95 -3.35 (5.7%).\nEdwards Lifesciences beat and after a move from the recent lows at $155 had closed the day $221.04 +4.52 (2.09%) it bolted higher to trade $238.00 and is currently $230 +8.96, an additional 4%.  Gilead (GILD) was lower after trading $84.00 earlier in the day, and the World Health Org (WHO) mistakenly published a report that the trial in China was ended and the drug, Remdesivir, was a flop.  It immediately fell to -6.2 and was halted at 12:46 for volatility.  After hitting 74.40 it moved back to close $77.78 -3.53 (4.34%).  ZM had a solid day on the news that it had reached 300MM users.  Zoom closed at another new high at $169.09 +18.84 (12.54%).  Last, Google reported after hours that they were slashing their marketing budget by 50% in the 2nd half of the year.  The stock closed $1217.17 +12.76 (1%) but is now $1240 \u201329.85 (2.46%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was MIXED with BIIB -5,76, ABBV +.41, REGN +7.44, ISRG +1.09, GILD (see above), MYL +.39, TEVA +.34, VRTX -1.49, BHC -.04, INCY +.93, ICPT -.14, LABU -.44 and IBB 123.00 -.58 (.47%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was MIXED with TLRY +.02, CGC -.20, CRON +.05, GWPH +.44, ACB -.001, PYX -.14, NBEV -.01, CURLF +.01, KERN +.49, and MJ $11.50 +.06 (.52%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was MIXED with LMT -4.40, RTX -.44, GD -3.37, TXT +1.21, NOC -7.26, BWXT +.62, TDY +3.38 and ITA $149.53 +.50 (.34%).\n \n  \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with the exception of the discounters.  M +.06, JWN +1.13, KSS +.53, DDS +3.14 (13.96%), JCP +.01, WMT -3.38, TGT -3.09, TJX -.65, RL +1.92, UAA +.19, LULU -1.13, TPR +.36, CPRI +.62 and XRT $33.18 -.12 (.36%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -18.40 (see above), AMZN +25.02, AAPL -2.96, FB -.78, NFLX +2.58, NVDA -5.57, TSLA -31.56 (4.31%), BABA -5.26, BIDU -2.54, CMG -20.26, BA +1.21, CAT +1.61, DIS -.48 and XLK $86.10 -1.29 (1.48%).\n \n  \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -2.48, JPM -.36, BAC -.02, MS -.58, C +.04, PNC +.53, AIG +.04, TRV -1.79, AXP -.04, V -1.09, and XLF $21.28 -.24 (1.12%).\n \nOIL, $16.50 +2.72. Oil was the BIGGEST STORY of the day again with the June contract taking over and recovering from what was surely forced liquidation in May.  Remember, that this will happen again unless the market improves before May 19th.  Oil stocks were higher with CVX +1.94, XOM +1.35, OXY +.78, OAS + .56 (197%), NBL +.64, MRO +.33, MPC +.93, RIG +.04, APA +1.23 (13%), BP -.03, HES +2.40 (6.09%) and XLE $34.47 +1.01 (3.02%).\n \n  \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,745.40 +7.10 After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. Tuesday night it fell and hit $1,666 before coming back up $20. Today it rallied again and I still expect much higher prices.  We are long NEM.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $7540 +425. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we\u2019d have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today\u2019s action was impressive.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $8.63 + .93 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "After reviewing AMD's earning for two quarters in a row where their guidance exactly matched their earning, I have come to conclusion that this will continue for foreseeable future. The reasons are as follows:\n\n1. AMD does not have fab. TSMC manufactures processors for AMD, which requires multi months of lead time. This implies that AMD knows exactly how many processors will be manufactured ahead of time and how much they will sell for, hence exact match every quarters.\n2. AMD does not seem to want to wage price war with Intel since Intel has bigger war chest where both will suffer and AMD will suffer more. I believe AMD is content being one of the player in duopoly. \n\nSo only thing to evaluate AMD is their guidance for the upcoming quarter and upcoming year. It is just OK, not spectacular.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020.\n\n# **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.\n*****\n&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. \u201cThe data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.\u201d As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.\n*****\n&gt; Charts are important\n&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday\u2019s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.\n*****\n&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen\u2019s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there\u2019s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. \u201cThe market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. \u201cWe\u2019re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. \u201cPart of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that\u2019s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,\u201d said Doll.\n*****\n&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIts going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,\u201d he said, \u201cThis one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that\u2019s defensive in nature is going to perform well.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy\u2019s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.\n*****\n&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.\n*****\n&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,\u201d said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey won\u2019t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that window will close, and we\u2019ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there\u2019s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a reflection of physical market conditions,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu\n\n&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).\n\n&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**\n\n&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term\n\n&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**\n\n&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It\u2019s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn\u2019t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.\n\n&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn\u2019t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won\u2019t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish\n\n&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA\u2019s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.\n\n&gt; April\u2019s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/826c536dba71629e9d1a26329db32eba/97c8d036ee5ba87c-9b/s500x750/55708144eea7c12b24adf731e9dc63e41e31604b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$BOH** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$TFC** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$SNA** \n&gt; * **$LVS** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$KALU** \n&gt; * **$EMR** \n&gt; * **$CIT** \n&gt; * **$FITB**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zBd2gQL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/25QY7uo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzAy7Pk.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xjSoWZ3.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RbwZ1le.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjS7QnD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY4wQPz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/F2u6ejr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QW6sJiO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gylBF9c.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vwNztBG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $422.96\n&gt; **Netflix, Inc.

        "selftext": "Alright gay bears let's get realistic. Your 4/17 150Ps are gunna be worth just as much as my pubes. OPEC being delayed? Job reports being more garbage than your puts? Donny going in public and telling us that this week was gunna be bad? Guess what, we're still gunna be green.\n\nFirst and foremost let's do a little basic fundamentals, have you dumbasses ever heard of VXX? This magnificent fuck measures implied volatility, and for you dumb cucks who don't know this yet, if IV is high, your option is just like your wife in my bed, FUCKED. Now I know you guys are checking Robinhood and saying \"Oh well IV says only 80%\" or whatever nonsense you see, but here comes VXX. VXX is STILL super duper high. Before the massive sell off, VXX did not even dare to cross the 20s, and its at 45 right now. So for once fuck what Robinhood is saying and use the REAL tool for IV.\n\nNow, let's add some pieces together. We know this is a shit show, and shit is seemingly getting worse, but why aren't puts printing? Well first thing Monday morning if SPY is red, one phone call to Senior Powell and brrrrr brrrrrrr at 8:30AM EST and boom 260 again?!?!? That's one scenario, the other scenario is this shit is priced in. But how?!?!?!? Do you think Papa Trump is really gunna go in public and say loud and clear \"America is fucked\" just for fun? Ofc not! But fuck them, pay attention to charts for a little and you'll see that volume is decreasing day by day, meaning any green we had was more than likely artificial. BUT WHY ARE PUTS NOT PRINTING? Here we're gunna really do some thinking. VXX is still not sober from snorting methamphetamines in February so PUTS WILL CONTINUE TO GET FUCKED UNTIL VXX IS BACK AT STABLE LEVELS. So am I suggesting my fellow gay bears to sit here and watch the market drop while we're not balls deep in puts? Heck no! But SPY puts are not the only way to make money here. Walk away from the big cock tickers, SPY AAPL MSFT, and let's go over somewhere with less \"big dick energy\". My fellow Robinhood cucks this is where you should open your ears. INTC May or later expiration, go as deep OTM you want, my personal PT is AT LEAST 44, meaning anything around 44 should be calm. Now my lazy and insecure ass after bleeding 80% of my portfolio on SPY puts did not look further than INTC, but trust me smaller blue chips are much safer to play now versus big namers.\n\nNow I will also say, VXX is at a super critical level, it can either drop here or get erect like my horse dick. There were large VXX call orders coming in before close on Friday, so it can go either way. But if VXX does go up again, puts will go up here sure, but not as much as we need for tendies, and no your OTM weeklies STILL don't stand a chance lmao.\n\nI see too many people here getting SPY puts, you're shooting yourself in the foot. Wait for the dust to settle because the nasty drop is still coming. Sitting on cash is an advantage itself, and if you're fucking itching to get into something, look for less exposed stocks to get into. There is still more than enough bad to go around for the next at least 12 months, so control your fucking FOMO because your weekly deposits into Robinhood will get you broke. Also, Gold. Gold is having a massive influx in demand, and there is not a lot of supply left.\n\nTLDR INTC 5/15 44P\n\nJNUG 9/18 ATM CALLS WILL SLAP",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020.\n\n# **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.\n*****\n&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. \u201cThe data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.\u201d As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.\n*****\n&gt; Charts are important\n&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday\u2019s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.\n*****\n&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen\u2019s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there\u2019s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. \u201cThe market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. \u201cWe\u2019re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. \u201cPart of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that\u2019s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,\u201d said Doll.\n*****\n&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIts going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,\u201d he said, \u201cThis one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that\u2019s defensive in nature is going to perform well.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy\u2019s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.\n*****\n&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.\n*****\n&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,\u201d said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey won\u2019t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that window will close, and we\u2019ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there\u2019s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a reflection of physical market conditions,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu\n\n&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).\n\n&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**\n\n&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term\n\n&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**\n\n&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It\u2019s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn\u2019t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.\n\n&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn\u2019t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won\u2019t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish\n\n&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA\u2019s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have not fared as well, up just 2.17%.\n\n&gt; April\u2019s historical performance over the recent 21-year period is plotted in the chart above (21-year average is on the left vertical scale) compared to April 2020 (right vertical scale). Magnitude of gains this year is substantial however, the trend this year has been similar to past years. Should the current trend remain intact, further gains this month are possible. Coronavirus uncertainty remains extremely elevated, but there does to be some light flickering at the end of tunnel.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/826c536dba71629e9d1a26329db32eba/97c8d036ee5ba87c-9b/s500x750/55708144eea7c12b24adf731e9dc63e41e31604b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$BOH** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$BMRC** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$AXP** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$CBU** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$TFC** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$SNA** \n&gt; * **$LVS** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$KALU** \n&gt; * **$EMR** \n&gt; * **$CIT** \n&gt; * **$FITB**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/zBd2gQL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/wlvhXbo.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/25QY7uo.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzAy7Pk.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xjSoWZ3.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RbwZ1le.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjS7QnD.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY4wQPz.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/F2u6ejr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QW6sJiO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gylBF9c.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vwNztBG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.24.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $422.96\n&gt; **Netflix, Inc.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 20th, 2020.\n\n# **A blast of earnings news is coming, but the market may be more focused on when the economy will reopen  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/a-blast-of-earnings-news-is-coming-but-the-market-may-be-more-focused-on-when-the-economy-will-reopen.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Earnings from IBM, Netflix, Coca-Cola and dozens of others are expected in the week ahead, but as the state shutdowns now reach the one-month threshold, the market is more likely to trade on virus headlines and news about reopening the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are also some important economic reports, including existing home sales on Monday and durable goods on Friday. But it is the weekly jobless claims data that will again be most relevant, as economists watch to see whether the number of workers seeking claims has now peaked and whether there are any signs some are returning to jobs, as government funds reach the hands of business owners.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, stocks were higher, but there was a divergence with the Dow up just under 2.2% at 24,242, and Nasdaq, surging 6%, lifted by tech and biotech. The S&amp;P 500 gained 3% for the week and is now 31% off its March lows.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained amid signs the virus outbreak has peaked and some reopenings could start slowly in the next few weeks.\n*****\n&gt; The market also bounced Friday as the results of an early study of a Gilead drug showed promise with severe cases of coronavirus. Technology stocks were up about 4% for the week, and health care was up more than 5% while consumer discretionary stocks led with a gain of more than 6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs the virus news goes, so go risk assets. People expect bad economic data,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. \u201cThe data is all expected to be horrible. The only economic data we can really look at now and start to measure is the claims data on Thursday.\u201d As of April 11, more than 22 million workers claimed unemployment benefits over a four-week period, as states shut down and schools, restaurants, stores and many other businesses closed or were forced to cut back.\n*****\n&gt; Charts are important\n&gt; Analysts who watch stock charts say technical levels will continue to have a powerful pull on the market, since so many traders have set their computers to trade around those numbers.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the S&amp;P 500 had a hard time breaking through the 50-day moving average Friday, and fell back after it initially edged near 2,862 in morning trading. But at the end of the trading day, it smashed through that level, surging to close at 2,874, a positive sign for Monday\u2019s open. The 50-day literally is the average closing price for the S&amp;P over the previous 50 sessions. Technical analysts believe watching moving averages gives them an important tool for price trends and momentum.\n*****\n&gt; Bob Doll, Nuveen\u2019s chief equity strategist, said he believes the market hit its bear market low on March 23, but it could take another dive towards lows at some point.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy [low] target was 2,350. We spent 36 hours below that and got to 2,192. If there\u2019s a secondary low, then probably the lowest chance is 2,350,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to go there, based on two things, the power of the rally and two, the stimulus. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Travelers, and Texas Instruments release results Tuesday. AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, and Intel, Blackstone and Eli Lily are reporting Thursday. American Express and Verizon are expected Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he expects the market to listen to comments from corporate executives on conference calls but ignore the actual earnings. \u201cThe market is going to pay a lot more attention to what can a rebound look like, and what can 2021 numbers look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be selling on that versus how deep is the hole going to be in the second quarter. The macro questions around that are recurrence, therapeutics, and vaccine and how fast can the economy come back, and nobody knows the answer to that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump laid out guidelines for reopening the economy, but left the decision making up to the states, which are facing varied levels of new infections. One issue is the lack of testing, and American businesses have pressed for more availability of test kits so workers can be brought back more safely.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he is partial to health care and technology stocks, and one reason is because of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. \u201cWe\u2019re now in QE4. We had QE1, QE2, QE3, and six months after QE 1, 2 and 3, there were two sectors that outperformed-technology and health care, and there were two that underperformed, utilities and REITs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Doll said he also is looking at how stocks might come through the virus shutdowns. \u201cPart of what you want to make sure is the company is going to make it through, and make sure the industry has decent demand getting out of it. If it has decent demand during it, that\u2019s a good thing, and that takes you back to health care and technology,\u201d said Doll.\n*****\n&gt; Leary said he expects companies to be scrutinized somewhat differently by analysts this quarter, and balance sheets will be more important.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIts going to be on a case-by-case basis about how analysts are going to look at them. This is not a typical recession. Recessions seem to hit different sectors,\u201d he said, \u201cThis one one is different in that it really has several losers like airlines and travel and entertainment companies. It has some real winners too. I like health care and pharma. Anything that\u2019s defensive in nature is going to perform well.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Companies have been tapping the corporate bond market at a record pace to boost their cash piles to help them through the economy\u2019s shutdown, and the coming week should be no different.\n*****\n&gt; The corporate debt market has been open for business and spreads have narrowed since the Fed announced a program to buy corporate debt. Companies have issued more than $160 billion in investment grade bonds so far this month, with JP Morgan issuing $10 billion this past week in the biggest bank deal ever, according to Credit Flow Research.\n*****\n&gt; More are expected in the coming week, as companies report earnings and exit the blackout period.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what corporate treasurers know is the window of opportunity for issuing debt at reasonable rates will quickly close once the economy starts opening,\u201d said Leary. He said balance sheets and earnings will be more scrutinized once things start to become more normal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey won\u2019t have an excuse anymore ... right now, everything is expected to unexpected,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that window will close, and we\u2019ll have to take a look at the bond market again. Their ability to issue will be impacted by their balance sheets...[now] there\u2019s plenty of cash coming at them. The Fed will step in to support.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Leary said some of the interest in corporate bonds is from investors who are fearful of buying stocks right now but may want to invest in a company through the safer play of its bonds. Leary said energy bonds are among the least desirable, with the huge drop in crude prices.\n*****\n&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May settled at $18.72 per barrel, it lowest level since January, 2002. But that contract expires Tuesday. The June contract settled at $25.08 per barrel, and will resume trading there next week as the active contract.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a reflection of physical market conditions,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital, of the big decline in the May contract. He said it shows that futures traders do not want to actually take delivery of the commodity, due to an increasing lack of storage space.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DgwrUcm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yKRo7Ea.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3rA0fDB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DrwoiV6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/i40FkmH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nMvlyBE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R8OVKd3.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eZZyOqa.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/douLwsS.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/dBSYk0L.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LwQokav.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/zgBClvX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Fcc6DrP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Markets Performed During the Spanish Flu\n\n&gt; With equities surging into the close ahead of the weekend, traders are shrugging their shoulders wondering how the hell the market is rallying given the economic damage inflicted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been cited as the worst pandemic to hit the United States since the 1918 Spanish flu. This leads to the question, how did the stock market perform during the Spanish flu outbreak? The chart below compares the performance of the DJIA to the weekly mortality rate of the Spanish flu during each of the waves of that pandemic from mid-1918 through early 1919 (as cited in a WSJ article earlier today).\n\n&gt; Looking at how the outbreak of the Spanish flu played out, there were basically three different waves of the virus (red line). The first wave in the summer of 1918 was a relatively mild one compared to the other two, and the DJIA's performance during that wave was essentially flat as it never declined more than 3%. The real damage from the Spanish flu was in the fall of 1918 when the mortality rate spiked up as high as 24 per 1,000 people per week. During that wave of the pandemic, which also came in the thick of a post-WWI recession, the DJIA peaked just as the wave was getting underway and fell for the next three months. Even with the severity of the outbreak during that wave, though, the DJIA never fell more than 11% from peak to trough. On a comparative basis, even after the 28% rally over the last four weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 15% from its high. Obviously, comparing two periods more than 100 years apart is hardly an apples to apples comparison, but it's still interesting that during what was an even deadlier pandemic in 1918, the DJIA never even approached anything close to a bear market.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart, the DJIA's low of the decline coincided with the second wave of the outbreak just as the third (more mild) wave of the pandemic was getting underway. Furthermore, during that third wave, the DJIA kicked off what was a strong rally of more than 25% in less than three months on optimism over an end to the outbreak.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-flue.png))**\n\n&gt; So, once the mortality rate of the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, it must have been nothing but clear skies ahead for the Dow, right? Well, not necessarily. When it comes to the stock market, there's always something. Less than a year after the mortality rate from the Spanish flu dropped down to zero, the US economy actually went into a year and a half long recession. That contraction was so severe that it has been dubbed the Depression of 1920/21, one where unemployment topped 10% and deflation was as high as 18%! The bear market that accompanied that recession was also severe as the DJIA declined 46%. Imagine coming out of a pandemic with nothing more than an 11% correction and then getting socked with that!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/041720-DJIA-1920-1921.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Shining in the Near Term, Gold Shining Over the Long Term\n\n&gt; Gold (GLD) has had an interesting run over the past year. Last spring, the ETF for the yellow metal finally pressed above multiyear resistance roughly around $130. After surging through late summer, GLD continued its rally at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before turning sharply lower alongside stocks in March. But since its March 19th low it has gone on to rally over 17% as of today and is now at its highest levels since early 2013.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; Another precious metal, Silver (SLV), has not been as fortunate. Although it shared in the rally last spring and summer, SLV has yet to eclipse its early September highs. While gold had broken out again in February and March, silver put in a lower high before plummeting to its lost level since 2009 in mid-March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/SLV.png))**\n\n&gt; But since that low on March 18th, SLV has actually outperformed rising 27.83%. Gold is up only up 15.14% since that same day and 17% since its respective low one day later on March 19th. While the S&amp;P 500's (SPY) low was not put in place until a few days after gold and silver on March 23rd, since March 18th, SLV is also outperforming SPY's 15.97% gain.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Performance-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Over the long term, though SLV is still the worst performer of the group. As shown in the chart below, SLV is down 8.84% over the past two years while the S&amp;P 500's gains have also been somewhat lackluster thanks to the most recent sell-off with only a 4.11% gain. Gold, on the other hand, has outshined the other two having surged 26.93%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Percent-GLD-SLV-SPY.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# It\u2019s Earnings Season (Or Whatever it is Companies Plan to Report)\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that time of year again. The time when corporate America reports financial results for the prior three months. Normally, we call it earnings season, but given the fact that most of the US economy has been shut down and no timetable is set for when it re-opens, for a lot of companies out there, there really isn\u2019t much in the way of earnings, revenues, or guidance to speak of. Instead, this reporting period will likely be a lot of companies trying to put the best spin on how much (or little) cash they have on hand to withstand the shutdown.\n\n&gt; Besides the major banks and financials, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot in the way of reports to speak of, but of the results we have seen, the stock market reaction hasn\u2019t been great as companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) have all seen negative reactions to their reports. The only large-cap that has really reacted positively to earnings so far is UnitedHealth (UNH) which gained more than 4%. Next week, the pace of reports will pick up, but the peak period for reports won\u2019t be for another two weeks when more than 300 companies will report in a single day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/calendar.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish\n\n&gt; April, the last month of DJIA &amp; S&amp;P 500 \u201cBest Six Months,\u201d has a strong historical track record. April 1999 was the first month DJIA gained over 1000 points (10.25%). April is also DJIA\u2019s best month since 1950 with an average 1.9% gain. After a disastrous March, the rally than began in late March has extended in April. As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA is up 7.39% so far this April. S&amp;P 500 is up 8.32%, NASDAQ has risen 10.81%.

If you do not remove these posts, you are put on notice that this will become a legal matter. Our legal department are already investigating two prior posts you made where you stated that you were ready to \"burn down the building\" as well as making the following statement: \u201c if I can\u2019t get my money back I\u2019ll be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way I can.''\"\n\nObviously the quotes in the email don't provide full context but the cops understood that and read it back to me. \n\nParaphrasing here but this is the comment regarding burning down the building: \n\n&gt;What is going on with Questrade support? This is such a joke. It pretty much feels like all they're saying is \"too bad so sad\" and \"fuck you\". Honestly getting tired with this.. I feel like I'm going crazy... getting ready to burn down the building. What a joke\n\nSo obviously I was saying it as a figure of speech and not serious in anyway regarding it but regardless Questrade took it to the police. \n\nThe other comment about \"if I can't get my money back I'll be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way I can\" was meant as in them losing potential/current client's commissions. Obviously I didn't mean any harm which I clarified in my reply to the original email. \n\nBasically the police cautioned me and said they don't think I was serious. \n\nThe call I got was around 1:30am EST and I asked if they usually call this late and the officer said that they were just getting to it cause they had more pressing matters (assuming COVID19). \n\nJust a waste of police resources in general if you ask me. Especially during this time. Like the guy from the TradeDesk said to me in an email...\n\n&gt;\"To keep things in perspective, the world is reeling from a tragic situation.  Thousands of people have lost their lives.  Our staff have been working around the clock to help our clients get through this unprecedented crisis.  In response to our genuine attempts to find an amicable solution, you have threatened and insulted our staff.  I urge you to think about your actions.\"\n\nI would urge Questrade to think about their actions. \n\nThe officer also asked me if I was the one writing posts about \"Questrade killing someone's wife\"(?) and I think something about Hitler but I was able to clarify that it wasn't me writing those posts and it was other people who were likely upset. \n\nJust find it pretty ridiculous that police had to waste their time going through screenshots sent by Questrade of their sub... \n\nNot sure why they would waste the police's time with this but it ultimately resulted in nothing. It was, in my opinion, obvious that those comments were both said out of frustration and I removed them (along with all comments) at the request of a Questrade employee as well anyway. \n\n\nI think what people should take away from this though is how poorly Questrade is treating its clients. If I were to phone them and be upset I don't want to be scared of potentially having a criminal charge brought forward on me because they took something I said out of frustration seriously and involved the police. Honestly think their handling of this matter has been incredibly unprofessional throughout. Upsetting to think this was a company I used to admire and recommend to countless people. \n\nEven just a few days before all this happened I was recommending them to friends - https://imgur.com/a/DHVOHhE\n\nIt's amazing to me how poorly they've handled all this and how in less than 3 weeks my opinion of them has done a complete 180. \n\nWhat a joke.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: The IHME model is trash. Media will soon notice. Long volatility via calendars on SPX for low risk high reward.\n\nAll right boys and girls, listen up. Professor BoneMaster's class is now in session. I'm a researcher at a university you've heard of, and I've been following the 'rona closely since January. I told my students to buy SPY puts in mid-February and that the global economy was going to shut down well into the summer only a couple weeks later. I'm up 300% so far by longing volatility, have been mostly cash for the past couple weeks, but am once again confident enough to be back in. As I've now convinced you of my predictive ability, let's get to it.\n\nThesis: The IHME model touted by Trump is bad. It is considerably under-shooting projected death counts. This becoming apparent is a very soon eventuality, which will be the catalyst for the next leg down.\n\nI'm going to try and keep this as simple as possible for the retards. The IHME model works as follows:\n\n1. Assumes cumulative deaths over time follows a curve like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Error\\_Function.svg), but normalized for only positive x,y.\n\n2. Fits parameters that control the shape of the curve for a given location using existing data. Specifically, it fits for the time where rate of change is maximum and the maximum rate itself more-or-less. It then predicts a maximum value based off of that.\n\nSo why is this approach retarded?\n\n1. Assuming a Gaussian-like curve for daily deaths and therefore a sigmoid-like curve for cumulative deaths makes sense in the context of a lot of basic epidemiological (SIR-like) models. We also saw curves like this in Wuhan. We are NOT seeing this in Italy or Spain. See daily infections and deaths for Spain [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/) and Italy [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/). What we are seeing is a leveling off of to a plateau/low angle slope. More later.\n\n2. The US models are fitted using data from Wuhan, Italy, and Spain. We are NOT following social distancing as closely as these countries. As others have posted in this sub, see [NY](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05\\_US\\_New\\_York\\_Mobility\\_Report\\_en.pdf) vs [Italy](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05\\_IT\\_Mobility\\_Report\\_en.pdf) vs [Spain](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05\\_ES\\_Mobility\\_Report\\_en.pdf). Americans are stupid and selfish. We aren't social distancing nearly as well as other countries.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n1. For Italy and Spain, the IHME estimates are getting more and more desperate. I've been watching the realized daily deaths blow outside their confidence bounds for the last few updates. For the most recent model from Wednesday, Italy just blew up the model's **UPPER-FUCKING BOUND** today ([570 realized](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/) vs. [522 max](https://covid19.healthdata.org/italy)). Spain is likely going to do it tomorrow or Sunday at the latest. Needless to say, a predictive model that consistently fails to predict two days out within the fucking 95% confidence interval **IS NOT A GOOD MODEL**. \n\n2. The prediction for the U.S. is going to get double fucked. It suffers from the invalid assumption of a nice Gaussian-like curve, plus it's essentially fit using data that paints a much rosier picture than reality. \n\nDeeper dive:\n\nThe model inherently assumes a notable inflection point. This occurred in Wuhan as the strict lockdown essentially killed almost all spread. The looser restrictions within Italy and Spain have kept the disease reproductive number sufficiently high enough to maintain something along the line of a plateau of daily new infections. Neither country is at the point where herd immunity has any effect, so this might be maintained for some amount of time. This could actually be considered the desired effect of flattening the curve, meaning that the restrictions are enough that the disease is under control but not so strict that you're welding people in their houses. \n\nGiven sufficient time, this will result in herd immunity. However, at the current rate, that would take about 25 years for Italy (2.5 years if rate is 10x under-reported, as thought). If this is in fact something of a steady-state, maintaining it also requires that restrictions are also essentially maintained as-is until vaccinations are possible. If the rate is actually plateaued, then even a slight loosening of restrictions will result in an immediate second wave.\n\nWhat I think is actually happening is something along the lines of a self-limiting population-wide response. With bad news people cower in their homes, but with good news (we passed the peak!) people start going back out again. Good/bad news creates a feedback cycle resulting in a steady-state rate of infections that's just low enough to not overwhelm the hospitals. I call this response the \"BoneMaster Effect\". \n\nI think Fauci et al. is well aware of all of this but waiting to break the news. At least, I would certainly fucking hope so. The IHME models for the US have been relatively accurate, as the curve is absolutely a good fit for initial-&gt;peak infections. But as we've only just started to hit the peak in certain areas, the BoneMaster Effect hasn't come into play yet. We have another week or so until IHME says NY infections will reduce by half (https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/new-york), though their confidence interval is fucking absurd. If by next Friday NY is still getting O(600-700) deaths per day, then people are going to take notice.\n\nSummary of other models:\n\nThe CovidActNow model is equally retarded, but in the other direction. It assumes way too high of a reproductive number with social distancing. The only good model with a fancy website I've found is the Los Alamos [one](https://covid-19.bsvgateway.org/). I've been keeping an eye on it, and they've generally been spot on. Basically, they don't make any explicit assumptions about disease growth rate except that it will trend down, then randomly samples over all possibilities of how the growth rate can change over time. This inherently captures that notion of plateau/low angle decreasing slope. More importantly, take a look at the 'team' leading that model and compare them to the original 'team' for CovidActNow vs. IHME. Notice anything? CovidActNow was started by a bunch of business fucks, IHME is like 90% attractive bio girls, but, by far, the Los Alamos team is the biggest group of nerds out there. Always bet on the nerds.\n\n\nUppies or downies:\n\nNeither. Long volatility. Calendar spreads below present value are the way to go along with a debit call spread for capping \"brrrr\" risk. Wait until you see the first article out hinting that Trump's model is completely fucked.\n\nReal TLDR: **A PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT CONSISTENTLY FAILS TO PREDICT TWO DAYS OUT WITHIN THE FUCKING 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL IS NOT A GOOD MODEL. LONG VOLATILITY. BET ON THE NERDS.**",

Not really. I'll share with you some of my DD and maybe you'll understand why.\n\n-------\n\nThe latest headlines have been all about how COVID-19 is peaking in NYC and will soon be peaking in the US as a whole. [This is the model](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) cited by the White House and is also the one most often mentioned by the media. It's been continuously revised down over the past weeks, from over 100k deaths, to 90k last week, to 80k Monday and now 60k today.\n\nI won't go into its flaws (the most obvious one being the assumption that there will be no deaths post-June). Instead, I'll elaborate on one of its main assumptions: \"COVID-19 projections **assuming full social distancing through May 2020**\". Is America applying full social distancing right now?\n\n#Exhibit #1: Google's Mobility Report\n\nGoogle recently released [a fascinating report](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on the mobility behavior of various countries (based on anonymized tracking data as of March 29th). These reports compare how much time people are spending in different types of locations (retail stores, grocery stores, parks, transit stations, workplaces and their homes) compared to usual.\n\nHere are the reports for [Italy](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_IT_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) and [Spain](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_ES_Mobility_Report_en.pdf). They look pretty similar, about a 85-90% decrease in traffic to retail, groceries, parks and transit stations.\n\nMeanwhile, this is what [New York](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_US_New_York_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) looks like: -60% retail and transit, -30% groceries, -50% parks. And keep in mind, this is the hardest-hit state in America; states like [Florida](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_US_Florida_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) have even worse numbers.\n\nMy point here is that as of a week ago, [America as a whole](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_US_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) was not even close to enacting social distancing measures on the levels of Spain or Italy. And even if such measures were implemented **now**, it would take at least 2 weeks for their effect to be felt on the charts (look at how long Spain and Italy have been at -90% on their traffic before their numbers leveled off).\n\n#Exhibit #2: Flight Radar\n\nNot only is the US not doing social distancing right, it also hasn't done much to restrict interstate travel. Here's a very telling stat: [2/3rds of global flights on March 28th were above North America](https://twitter.com/flightradar24/status/1244003511098134529). Think that has changed since then? Think again: here's [Europe + Asia + North Africa now](https://i.imgur.com/7etzRT5.png) (1200 flights total, top-left corner), here's just [the eastern states](https://i.imgur.com/hcDYc2T.png) (1500 flights, which is the maximum Flightradar can show on one screen).\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that even the states which are implementing lockdowns and bending the curve now will have fresh new outbreaks as soon as they lift their measures. Air travel is the easiest way for the virus to spread via asymptomatic carriers and the only way to prevent this is a domestic travel ban. That doesn't look like it's gonna happen anytime soon.\n\n#Conclusion\n\nTo me it seems very clear that a large majority of America's population will be contracting this virus over the next month and a half. Italy and Spain made enormous social sacrifices to stop the outbreak and their success is just now becoming apparent. As of right now America is not doing nearly enough to follow in their steps, so exponential growth should continue unabated.\n\nHow does this relate to my SPX puts? How the market responds to this is a topic for another time, but let me just say this: my puts might be down now, but that doesn't mean America is any less fucked.\n\n#Further Reading\n\n[Great overview of the coronavirus situation in America](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-out-of-many-one-36b886af37e9)\n\n[A model that's not nearly as optimistic as whatever the White House is peddling right now](https://www.covidactnow.org/)",

        "selftext": "After a long time of very responsibly trading blue chip stocks for modest gains single digit gains, last week I started contriving a plan to get into oil and hit it big. \n\nI spent at least 40 hours considering all my possible options. Then on Monday afternoon, it became clear to me - **it was time to strike**. I put 50% of my money in. \n\nTuesday morning was not fun.  \n\\-\n\nHere's what I learned:\n\n* Don\u2019t ever buy something you don\u2019t FULLY understand. On Monday, I bought into USO as oil prices bottomed, thinking I was buying into a fund that was purchasing up all of the May Futures contracts. I thought USO was rolling out of April and into May, and they were conveniently buying up all the world\u2019s WTI at bottom of the barrel pricing. I saw the warnings all over the place that people didn\u2019t understand that USO was based on futures, not spot prices. I KNEW USO was buying futures, not spot. I thought that meant I understood the warnings. I didn\u2019t know that the real risk was that I didn\u2019t know which months I was buying into. The funny truth is that they weren\u2019t even making most of their moves on Monday. I was WAY off.\n* Don\u2019t trust third party sources on the details - not even your bank. Both Yahoo Finance, and my bank - RBC Direct Investing - have incorrect information on USO and most major ETFs. For as long as I have been looking (2 weeks), they said USO is holding April WTI Futures. This is 100% false.\n* The word \u201cETF\u201d is used extremely loosely. An ETF like SPY or ZQQ.to, is absolutely nothing like all the ETFs out there that are \u201cattempting to track daily movements of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d. Don\u2019t buy into ETFs that you do not FULLY understand. Read the actual prospectus.\n* Do not underestimate the number of stupid investors out there. As I watched WTI plummet in real time, I immediately saw USO skyrocketing, I thought for sure that meant that smart institutional money was piling into USO. I thought there was no way that retail investors could move a $2.5B fund that fast, but they were. That was not smart money causing the pump. It was a million idiots like me.\n* Don\u2019t fuck around with leveraged ETFs. In addition to USO, I purchased into a 2X leveraged WTI tracking ETF \u201cHOU.to\u201d at the very end of the day on Monday. I thought for sure on Tuesday morning the oil prices would bounce back up from negative, and give me a big bump. I figured, even if it didn\u2019t work out, I could hold onto it forever until oil comes back. Wrong. You cannot hold onto these things forever. They trend towards 0 mathematically. If you can\u2019t make gains in your first couple of days or weeks, you are probably stuck with taking a loss. You shouldn\u2019t even hold these things more than a single trading day. ESPECIALLY in this crazy market.\n* Despite your Father's advice, you can't just be patient and hold on to everything. [HOU.to](https://HOU.to) which I purchased into is beyond toast. The company has all but told investors it\u2019s time to cash out. After the fund lost 40% of it\u2019s value on Tuesday, they froze it, and then released an official press release that the ETF was worth about 1/6th of its already obliterated market price. They then said pretty clear that they no longer expected to be able to achieve the funds objectives. After a few cuss words, I basically kissed my money goodbye. Then much to my pleasant surprise, on Wednesday morning, I saw it was back up for trade. Somehow it was rising. (This goes back to not underestimating the power of stupid money.) I cashed out immediately, and was very pleased to get 2 /3 of my money back. The fund has done nothing but post double digit losses since then, and still millions of people are continuing to trade it, when they should instead be cutting their losses. While June futures are up 70% since Tuesday, this 2x ETF is down like 50% - yet people still cling on.\n* The biggest lesson in these oil ETF\u2019s is that NOTHING is certain in this crazy ass market. A TON of the pain that I felt this week was caused by USO and other funds like them restructuring. USO has been rolling front month futures on a predictable calendar for 12 years. On Tuesday morning they absolutely fucked my investment in USO, and probably contributed to the obliteration of HOU.to by surprising us all with a restructuring announcement. I never in my life thought that USO was going to restructure. I thought the whole point of it was that they were legally obligated to follow a certain predictable futures trading pattern - and that certainty gave people a mechanism to buy and sell. NOPE. They can legally just do whatever the hell they want, costing retail investors like me an arm and a leg, while their fund managers continue to make 7 figure salaries.\n* Last but certainly not least, this week should be a lesson to us all that there are mammoth sized financial incongruities hidden in every corner of the global economy right now. The insanity that has taken place in the oil industry this week should be a warning bell to us all. The 2008 crisis was caused by bad assets in a SINGLE industry. Considering the demand for everything is down by at least 30%, and the governments have propped the world up with free cash equivalent to over 10% of global GDP - to it\u2019s quite certain that there are \u201csub prime mortgage backed security\u201d equivalent death traps forming in every single industry. It\u2019s only a matter of time before more of them pop up. They could appear on Monday. They could appear in August. But anyone who is paying attention is fairly certain they are out there. \n* Be careful.",

But just for discussion I wanted to bring this up and see what people think... \n\nI was just listening to the Bigger Pockets podcast (a podcast for real estate investors) and everyone on there seemed so optimistic with little acknowledgement of the true situation we are in. I heard comments like: \n\n\\- \"Maybe we will see a small dip in prices over the summer\" \n\n\\- \"I'm only seeing rents dropping 3-4% in my area and I don't think we'll see it go much lower for now\"\n\nSo banks are tightening lending requirements, we have mass unemployment (maybe 20% ?) , we have situations where you literally cannot evict non-paying tenants and by some counts I read we have 30% of US tenants not paying rent.

        "selftext": "I just want to ask you what was your original thesis was regarding this medical and financial crisis?\n\nI, for one, am still bearish, even if SP500 goes up 5% tonight. Consider this, during the 2008 financial crisis, the VIX hit an all time high at 89.53 on 10/24/2008. It subsequently crashed down to 44.25 as of 11/4/08 (almost exactly 50% retracement), only to rocket back up to 81.48 as of 11/20/2008. Relatively speaking, options were hella cheap on 11/4/08 considering the turmoil going on at the time. If you were to go back and look, SPY closed at 97.11 on 11/3 and closed at 100.41 on 11/4, +3.4% in the green for the day, and we still had another 34% down left to go!\n\nWhile I'm *not* saying that **FOR SURE** the same thing applies this time, we are now nearly at our 50% retracement point on the VIX. We peaked at 85.47 on 3/18/20 and, as I write this, are at 46.8 late in the evening on 4/5/20 (45% retracement). For me, I still have A LOT of unresolved questions about this market that feed my bearish sentiments. For one, we are GOING to have [record unemployment](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate), and I just don't see that getting fixed quickly. Yes, stimulus checks, unemployment income boosts, and generous federal loan programs for small businesses help, but what about the negative [wealth effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealtheffect.asp) on consumption? What about [over-leveraged corporations who were pleading for mercy the very INSTANT their revenues were disrupted](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airlines-plead-state-relief-virus-190239895.html)? What about the [retailers refusing to pay rent](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-04/coronavirus-landlords-in-peril-as-retailers-refuse-to-pay-rent)?\n\nThe reality is that even countries like Italy, where there have been steady declines in new cases and deaths are [extending out their stay at home orders](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/01/825499871/italy-seen-by-white-house-as-a-u-s-analogue-extends-nationwide-lockdown) because the country doesn't want \"the curve\" to bend back so soon. We **MIGHT** be seeing the top of the curve for New York right now, but the rest of the country? Most of the regions are still going up! Just because the curve has started to bend back the other way, doesn't mean we can all just open up shop again and everything is dandy. Hell, even in China where they allegedly are all back to work, [look at their weekend traffic](https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/shanghai-traffic/)! There are a lot of unanswered questions left, and many of them do not have easy answers.\n\nSo should you sell or should you hold your puts? **Idk, that's for you to decide.** But before you get all wrapped up in Trump and OPEC's bullish oil thesis (which is a whole 'nother \"no easy answers\" situation by itself), consider just how easily this recent whiff of positive sentiment can be swept away once the other realities of this present crisis are front and center and start needing to be addressed..\n\nGood Luck, God Speed.",

        "selftext": "Hello, dummies\n\nIt's your old pal, Fuzzy.\n\nAs I'm sure you've all noticed, a lot of the stuff that gets posted here is - to put it delicately - fucking ridiculous. More backwards-ass shit gets posted to r/wallstreetbets than you'd see on a Westboro Baptist community message board. I mean, I had a look at the daily threat yesterday and..... yeesh. I know, I know. [We all make like the divine Laura Dern circa 1992 on the daily](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8661496232_2df568ba28_n.jpg) and stick our hands deep into this steaming heap of shit to find the nuggets of valuable and/or hilarious information within (thanks for reading, BTW). I agree. I love it just the way it is too. That's what makes WSB great.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that a lot of the stuff that gets posted here - notwithstanding it being funny or interesting - is just... wrong. Like, fucking your cousin wrong. And to be clear, I mean the fucking your \\*first\\* cousin kinda wrong, before my Southerners in the back get all het up (simmer down, Billy Ray - I know Mabel's twice removed on your grand-sister's side). Truly, I try to let it slide. [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/) [do](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fplquv/something_fishy_fuzzys_seas_covenant_breakdown/) [my](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqk15o/fallen_angels_shitty_cars_worse_debt_and_what_it/) [bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsbto9/the_ballad_of_big_dick_vick_onions_futures_and/) to try and put you on the right path. Most of the time, I sleep easy no matter how badly I've seen someone explain what a bank liquidity crisis is. But out of all of those tens of thousands of misguided, autistic attempts at understanding the world of high finance, one thing gets so consistently - so \\*emphatically\\* - fucked up and misunderstood by you retards that last night I felt obligated at the end of a long work day to pull together this edition of *Finance with Fuzzy* just for you. It's so serious I'm not even going to make a u/pokimane gag. Have you guessed what it is yet? Here's a clue. It's in the title of the post.\n\nThat's right, friends. Today in the neighborhood we're going to talk all about **hedging in financial markets** \\- spots, swaps, collars, forwards, CDS, synthetic CDOs, all that fun shit. Don't worry; I'm going to explain what all the scary words mean and how they impact your OTM RH positions along the way.\n\nWe're going to break it down like this. (1) \"What's a hedge, Fuzzy?\" (2) Common Hedging Strategies and (3) All About ISDAs and Credit Default Swaps.\n\nBefore we begin. For the nerds and JV traders in the back (and anyone else who needs to hear this up front) - I am simplifying these descriptions for the purposes of this post. I am also obviously not going to try and cover every exotic form of hedge under the sun or give a detailed summation of what caused the financial crisis. If you are interested in something specific ask a question, but don't try and impress me with your Investopedia skills or technical points I didn't cover; I will just be forced to flex my years of IRL experience on you in the comments and you'll look like a big dummy.\n\n**TL;DR?** Fuck you. There is no TL;DR. You've come this far already. What's a few more paragraphs? Put down the Cheetos and try to concentrate for the next 5-7 minutes. You'll learn something, and I promise I'll be gentle.\n\nReady? Let's get started.\n\n**1.** **The Tao of Risk: Hedging as a Way of Life**\n\nThe simplest way to characterize what a hedge 'is' is to imagine every action having a binary outcome. One is bad, one is good. Red lines, green lines; uppie, downie. With me so far? Good. A 'hedge' is simply the employment of a strategy to mitigate the effect of your action having the *wrong* binary outcome. You wanted X, but you got Z! Frowny face. A hedge strategy introduces a *third* outcome. If you hedged against the *possibility* of Z happening,  then you can wind up with Y instead. Not as good as X, but not as bad as Z. The technical definition I like to give my idiot juniors is as follows:\n\n*Utilization of a defensive strategy to mitigate risk, at a fraction of the cost to capital of the risk itself*.\n\nCongratulations. You just finished Hedging 101. \"But Fuzzy, that's easy! I just sold a naked call against my 95% OTM put! I'm adequately hedged!\". Spoiler alert: you're not (although good work on executing a collar, which I describe below). What I'm talking about here is what would be referred to as a 'perfect hedge'; a binary outcome where downside is totally mitigated by a risk management strategy. That's not how it works IRL. Pay attention; this is the tricky part.\n\nYou can't take a single position and conclude that you're adequately hedged because risks are fluid, not static. So you need to constantly adjust your position in order to maximize the value of the hedge and insure your position. You also need to consider exposure to more than one category of risk. There are micro (specific exposure) risks, and macro (trend exposure) risks, and both need to factor into the hedge calculus.\n\nThat's why, in the real world, the value of hedging depends entirely on the design of the hedging strategy itself. Here, when we say \"value\" of the hedge, we're not talking about cash money - we're talking about the intrinsic value of the hedge relative to the the risk profile of your underlying exposure. To achieve this, people hedge ***dynamically***. In r/wallstreetbets terms, this means that as the value of your position changes, you need to change your hedges too. The idea is to efficiently and continuously distribute and rebalance risk across different states and periods, taking value from states in which the marginal cost of the hedge is low and putting it back into states where marginal cost of the hedge is high, until the shadow value of your underlying exposure is equalized across your positions. The punchline, I guess, is that one static position is a hedge in the same way that the finger paintings you make for your wife's boyfriend are art - it's technically correct, but you're only playing yourself by believing it. \n\nAnyway. Obviously doing this as a small potatoes trader is hard but it's worth taking into account. Enough basic shit. So how does this work in markets?\n\n**2. A Hedging Taxonomy**\n\nThe best place to start here is a practical question. What does a business need to hedge against? Think about the specific risk that an individual business faces. These are legion, so I'm just going to list a few of the key ones that apply to most corporates. (1) You have commodity risk for the shit you buy or the shit you use. (2) You have currency risk for the money you borrow. (3) You have rate risk on the debt you carry. (4) You have offtake risk for the shit you sell. Complicated, right? To help address the many and varied ways that shit can go wrong in a sophisticated market, smart operators like yours truly have devised a whole bundle of different instruments which can help you manage the risk. I might write about some of the more complicated ones in a later post if people are interested (CDO/CLOs, strip/stack hedges and bond swaps with option toggles come to mind) but let's stick to the basis for now.\n\n(i) Swaps\n\nA swap is one of the most common forms of hedge instrument, and they're used by pretty much everyone that can afford them. The language is complicated but the concept isn't, so pay attention and you'll be fine. This is the most important part of this section so it'll be the longest one.\n\nSwaps are derivative contracts with two counterparties (before you ask, you can't trade 'em on an exchange - they're OTC instruments only). They're used to exchange one cash flow for another cash flow of equal expected value; doing this allows you to take speculative positions on certain financial prices or to alter the cash flows of existing assets or liabilities within a business. \"Wait, Fuzz; slow down! What do you mean sets of cash flows?\". Fear not, little autist. Ol' Fuzz has you covered.\n\nThe cash flows I'm talking about are referred to in swap-land as 'legs'. One leg is fixed -  a set payment that's the same every time it gets paid - and the other is variable - it fluctuates (typically indexed off the price of the underlying risk that you are speculating on / protecting against). You set it up at the start so that they're notionally equal and the two legs net off; so at open, the swap is a zero NPV instrument. Here's where the fun starts. If the price that you based the variable leg of the swap on changes, the value of the swap will shift; the party on the wrong side of the move ponies up via the variable payment. It's a zero sum game.\n\nI'll give you an example using the most vanilla swap around; an interest rate trade. Here's how it works. You borrow money from a bank, and they charge you a rate of interest. You lock the rate up front, because you're smart like that. But then - *quelle surprise*! - the rate gets **better** after you borrow. Now you're bagholding to the tune of, I don't know, 5 bps. Doesn't sound like much but on a billion dollar loan that's a lot of money (a classic example of the kind of 'small, deep hole' that's terrible for profits). Now, if you had a swap contract on the rate before you entered the trade, you're set; if the rate goes down, you get a payment under the swap. If it goes up, whatever payment you're making to the bank is netted off by the fact that you're borrowing at a sub-market rate. Win-win! Or, at least, Lose Less / Lose Less. That's the name of the game in hedging.\n\nThere are **many** different kinds of swaps, some of which are pretty exotic; but they're all different variations on the same theme. If your business has exposure to something which fluctuates in price, you trade swaps to hedge against the fluctuation. The valuation of swaps is also super interesting but I guarantee you that 99% of you won't understand it so I'm not going to try and explain it here although I encourage you to google it if you're interested.\n\nBecause they're OTC, none of them are filed publicly. Someeeeeetimes you see an ISDA (dsicussed below) but the confirms themselves (the individual swaps) are not filed. You can usually read about the hedging strategy in a 10-K, though. For what it's worth, most modern credit agreements ban non-speculative hedging. Top tip: This is occasionally something worth checking in credit agreements when you invest in businesses that are debt issuers - being able to do this increases the risk profile significantly and is particularly important in times of economic volatility (ctrl+f \"non-speculative\" in the credit agreement to be sure).\n\n(ii) Forwards\n\nA forward is a contract made today for the future delivery of an asset at a pre-agreed price. That's it. \"But Fuzzy! That sounds just like a futures contract!\". I know. Confusing, right? Just like a futures trade, forwards are generally used in commodity or forex land to protect against price fluctuations. The differences between forwards and futures are small but significant. I'm not going to go into **super** boring detail because I don't think many of you are commodities traders but it is still an important thing to understand even if you're just an RH jockey, so stick with me.\n\nJust like swaps, forwards are OTC contracts - they're not publicly traded. This is distinct from futures, which are traded on exchanges (see [The Ballad Of Big Dick Vick](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsbto9/the_ballad_of_big_dick_vick_onions_futures_and/) for some more color on this). In a forward, no money changes hands until the maturity date of the contract when delivery and receipt are carried out; price and quantity are locked in from day 1. As you now know having read about BDV, futures are marked to market daily, and normally people close them out with synthetic settlement using an inverse position.  They're also liquid, and that makes them easier to unwind or close out in case shit goes sideways.\n\nPeople use forwards when they absolutely have to get rid of the thing they made (or take delivery of the thing they need). If you're a miner, or a farmer, you use this shit to make sure that at the end of the production cycle, you can get rid of the shit you made (and you won't get fucked by someone taking cash settlement over delivery). If you're a buyer, you use them to guarantee that you'll get whatever the shit is that you'll need at a price agreed in advance. Because they're OTC, you can also exactly tailor them to the requirements of your particular circumstances.\n\nThese contracts are incredibly byzantine (and there are even crazier synthetic forwards you can see in money markets for the true degenerate fund managers). In my experience, only Texan oilfield magnates, commodities traders, and the weirdo forex crowd fuck with them. I (i) do not own a 10 gallon hat or a novelty size belt buckle (ii) do not wake up in the middle of the night freaking out about the price of pork fat and (iii) love greenbacks too much to care about other countries' monopoly money, so I don't fuck with them.\n\n(iii) Collars\n\nNo, not the kind your wife is encouraging you to wear try out to 'spice things up' in the bedroom during quarantine. Collars are actually the hedging strategy **most applicable** to WSB. Collars deal with options! Hooray!\n\nTo execute a basic collar (also called a wrapper by tea-drinking Brits and people from the Antipodes), you buy an put out of the money put while simultaneously writing a covered call on the same equity. The put protects your position against price drops and writing the call produces income that offsets the put premium. Doing this limits your tendies (you can only profit up to the strike price of the put) but also writes down your risk. If you screen large volume trades with a VOL/OI of more than 3 or 4x (and they're not bullshit biotech stocks), you can sometimes see these being constructed in real time as hedge funds protect themselves on their shorts.\n\n**(3) All About ISDAs, CDS and Synthetic CDOs**\n\nYou may have heard about the mythical [ISDA](https://www.isda.org/a/23iME/Legal-Guidelines-for-Smart-Derivatives-Contracts-ISDA-Master-Agreement.pdf). Much like an indenture (discussed in my post on $F), it's a magic legal machine that lets you build swaps via trade confirms with a willing counterparty. They are **very complicated** legal documents and you need to be a true expert to fuck with them. Fortunately, I am, so I do. They're made of two parts; a Master (which is a form agreement that's always the same) and a Schedule (which amends the Master to include your specific terms). They are also the engine behind just about every major credit crunch of the last 10+ years.\n\nFirst - a brief explainer. An ISDA is a not in and of itself a hedge - it's an umbrella contract that governs the terms of your swaps, which you use to construct your hedge position. You can trade commodities, forex, rates, whatever, all under the same ISDA. They're also responsible for just about every major credit crunch in the last two decades.\n\nLet me explain. Remember when we talked about swaps? Right. So. You can trade swaps on just about anything. In the late 90s and early 2000s, people had the smart idea of using other people's debt and or credit ratings as the variable leg of swap documentation. These are called **credit default swaps**. I was actually starting out at a bank during this time and, I gotta tell you, the only thing I can compare people's enthusiasm for this shit to was that moment in your early teens when you discover jerking off. Except, unlike your bathroom bound shame sessions to Mom's Sears catalogue, every single person you know felt that way too; and they're all doing it at once. It was a fiscal circlejerk of epic proportions, and the financial crisis was the inevitable bukkake finish. WSB autism is absolutely no comparison for the enthusiasm people had during this time for lighting each other's money on fire.\n\nHere's how it works. You pick a company. Any company. Maybe even your own! And then you write a swap. In the swap, you define \"Credit Event\" with respect to that company's debt as the variable leg . And you write in... whatever you want. A ratings downgrade, default under the docs, failure to meet a leverage ratio or FCCR for a certain testing period... whatever. Now, this started out as a hedge position, just like we discussed above. The purest of intentions, of course. But then people realized - if bad shit happens, **you make money**. And banks... don't like calling in loans or forcing bankruptcies. Can you smell what the moral hazard is cooking?\n\nEnter synthetic CDOs. CDOs are basically pools of asset backed securities that invest in debt (loans or bonds). They've been around for a minute but they got famous in the 2000s because a shitload of them containing subprime mortgage debt went belly up in 2008. This got a lot of publicity because a lot of sad looking rednecks got foreclosed on and were interviewed on CNBC. \"OH!\", the people cried. \"Look at those big bad bankers buying up subprime loans! They caused this!\". Wrong answer, America. The debt wasn't the problem. What a lot of people don't realize is that the real meat of the problem was not in regular way CDOs investing in bundles of shit mortgage debts in **synthetic CDOs investing in CDS predicated on that debt**. They're *synthetic* because they don't have a stake in the actual underlying debt; just the instruments riding on the coattails. The reason these are so popular (and remain so) is that smart structured attorneys and bankers like your faithful correspondent realized that an even **more** profitable and efficient way of building high yield products with limited downside was investing in instruments that profit from failure of debt **and in** instruments that rely on that debt and then hedging *that* exposure with other CDS instruments in paired trades, and on and on up the chain. The problem with doing this was that everyone wound up exposed to everybody else's books as a result, and when one went tits up, everybody did. Hence, recession, Basel III, etc. Thanks, Obama.\n\nHeavy investment in CDS can also have a warping effect on the price of debt (something else that happened during the pre-GFC years and is starting to happen again now).  This happens in three different ways. (1) Investors who previously were long on the debt hedge their position by **selling** CDS protection on the underlying, putting downward pressure on the debt price. (2) Investors who previously shorted the debt switch to **buying** CDS protection because the relatvively illiquid debt (partic. when its a bond) trades at a discount below par compared to the CDS. The resulting reduction in short selling puts upward pressure on the bond price. (3) The delta in price and actual value of the debt tempts some investors to become NBTs (neg basis traders) who long the debt and purchase CDS protection. If traders can't take leverage, nothing happens to the price of the debt. If basis traders **can** take leverage (which is nearly always the case because they're holding a hedged position), they can push up the debt price, goosing swap premiums etc. Anyway. Enough technical details. \n\nI could keep going. This is a fascinating topic that is very poorly understood and explained, mainly because the people that caused it all still work on the street and use the same tactics today (it's also *terribly* taught at business schools because none of the teachers were actually around to see how this played out live). But it relates to the topic of today's lesson, so I thought I'd include it here.\n\nWork depending, I'll be back next week with a covenant breakdown. Most upvoted ticker gets the post.",

        "selftext": "Hello, friends -\n\nIt's me, Fuzzy. Welcome back. I know, I know. I'm excited too. I had this up at market open but it got spiked by automod \\*twice\\* so I'm hoping third time's the charm. \n\nDid you guys see that movie, *The Accountant*? The one where [Sad Ben Affleck](https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ab58b2922f093031d9fb8fa/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Fry-The-Great-Sadness-of-Ben-Affleck.jpg) plays an autistic accountant for organized crime who doubles as a stone-cold killer? Yeah, me neither.  I mainly remember it exists because it features Anna Kendrick, a Fuzzy Fave (TM). In the March Madness for my heart, she's a 4 or 5 seed in her conference for sure (look out, u/pokimane). Anyway, that's what we're going to be talking about today. No, not March Madness (never got the fuss) or Sad Ben Affleck (21st century existential icon) - not even Fuzzy's Faves. Today, we're all about bean-counting - specifically, EBITDA, the magic number that makes all of your accounting problems disappear. I figured it was time you autists got to learnin' how businesses can lose money on paper but still be in the green with their creditors - especially at the moment, what with the bat flu and all, when many businesses are trying to explain that no one should panic and they're still in the black (even though they're definitely not). Let's get started.\n\nNow - disclaimer - I am **not** an accountant (obviously). If you are, feel free to flex in the comments and explain to me how mastery of forward-looking deduction writeoffs or some other fucking word jumble would make me a more complete human and save me $0.03 on my taxes every second five-year rolling addback window. The thing is, like most people that wind up on the human facing side of the finance industry, I cared too much about getting laid in college to give a shit about how to make numbers dance on a P/L statement, so I never really bothered to learn much more than the basics.  Once you hit the real world, though, those pocket-protecting calculator jockeys get preeeetty important, pretty fast. Tax, forensics, regular ol' corporate book-keeping - in business-land, you name it, you need an accountant to either do it for you or sign off on it before you send it to the board. So, you know, accountants. Not all bad.\n\nAnyway, even though I'm not an accountant, one thing I **do** know a lot about is EBITDA. Why? Because it's one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds of modern corporate finance, so I deal with it every day. \"But Fuzzy! How can you negotiate something that's an established accounting concept? Isn't that like trying to change 2+2 so it equals 5?\" And the answer - if EBITDA was a regular accounting concept - would be yes. But fortunately for borrowers, private equity cowboys and corporate finance lawyers (as well as lovers of weasel words everywhere), it's not, so you can. See, there's a difference between GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and... well everything that's not GAAP. You can't fuck with GAAP. How something \\*becomes\\* or even \\*became\\* GAAP in the first place... unclear. I guess in ancient times some bespectacled prophet came down from Mt. Nerd with spreadsheets carved on stone tablets, and whatever was on them wound up being generally accepted. I don't know, I'm not a fucking theologian. But however it happened, you can't fuck with it. Happily, though, EBITDA is non-GAAP, so like all the best girls, it's whatever you want it to be.\n\nBut we're getting ahead of ourselves. Today's post is going to be a tale of two halves. We're going to go through what EBITDA is and why it's important, and then we're going to go through a meme-tastic example to show how it can be manipulated - using everyone's favorite manufacturer of tendie-powered cars, rocketships, and flamethrowers... $TSLA!\n\nIf you want to play along at home, here's [$TSLA's 10-K](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/07bfcb70-aba1-4a27-af09-4f101678320c). Now I know people get all hot and bothered about $TSLA for whatever reason (did you know there's a dedicated Tesla investors subreddit? fucking weird). So let's get this clear from the jump - every single company does this, and I'm not implying that $TSLA is doing anything 'wrong' or 'bad'. I don't give a shit about the ticker or the cars or Elon's mission to put weed on Mars or whatever the fuck he's doing these days, so don't come at me in the comments about any of that shit. They're just the example we're using to work through this exercise. They've actually got a fascinating debt structure that is worthy of its own post (Musk or his family can take it private at any point without triggering a change of control under the docs... what?!), but today we're limiting our scope to the way they're allowed to calculate EBITDA.\n\nOK. Ready? Let's do this. Sincere and/or funny questions in the comments answered as always.\n\n1. **EBITDA - A User's Guide**\n\nWhen it comes to people, it's pretty easy to measure performance. Where you went to school, how much you make, where you live, how hot your wife is, how long... you get the idea. The point is that life is full of concrete, objective measures to help you figure out how worthwhile (or not) you really are as a human. Stretch out to the \"All Time\" view on your RH graph to give yourself an idea of where you sit.\n\nBusinesses have a bunch of these metrics they can look at. Profits, cashflow, sales... the list goes on. The issues with most of those, though, is that running a business is a pretty complicated job. There's a whole lot of shit that goes into those numbers each financial year, and not all of it is necessarily indicative of the 'normal' baseline of performance. Maybe you have a bad quarter because of the 'rona (pour one out for $WFC..... yikes). Maybe you get slugged with a tax bill, or a big interest repayment from your bank. Now that might hurt your operating profit on a one-off basis, but it's not something you expect to keep happening. You don't want your shareholders to freak out over nothing. That's where EBITDA comes in (say it like EEE-BIT-DAH).\n\nEBITDA stands for **E**arnings **B**efore **I**nterest **T**axes **D**epreciation and **A**mortization. The idea is essentially to find that baseline - to produce a number which reflects the true earnings of the business when the pernicious influence of taxes, financing, and accounting is taken out of the equation. Basically, you calculate it by **adding back** non-cash expenses to your baseline operating income. That's it. Simple, right? \"OK Fuzz, but what's a non-cash expense? Couldn't that be like... anything?\" Exactly.\n\nBecause EBITDA as a concept is more malleable than your more... black and white metrics, borrowers like to use it in loan documentation - particularly in leveraged finance, where it typically serves as the measure of earnings for the company. It's also used as a building block of incurrence baskets - the higher your EBITDA, the more you get to utilize under a particular basket. Usually this is done by way of a either/or construct - you can have $50 million **or** $25%  (or whatever) of your EBITDA, whichever is greater. It also turns up in financial covenants and step-downs in asset sale sweeps, excess cash flow sweeps, and pricing. There's a bunch of other non-finance ways it gets used too, but we're just going to stick to this for now.\n\nSometimes companies will try and flex their 'record EBITDA' numbers in a 10-K. But if you read on, you'll see  that every time they do this, it's qualified by the fact that it's non-GAAP and not accepted blah blah blah. So just be mindful of that when you're reviewing those documents and always read the real numbers before you make a call on how the business is actually doing.\n\nAnyway, let's see how it can be manipulated.\n\n2. **Cookin' With Elon - The $TSLA Example**\n\nLet's take a peek under the hood of [$TSLA's Credit Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312519095913/d625340dex1068.htm) to see what's going on with their EBITDA. Remember how I said you could calculate EBITDA by just adding back non-cash expenses to operating income? That's right... in theory. Have a look at this (just skim it, reading it cold will give you a headache. I'm going to break it down for you anyway - this is just for illustrative purposes):\n\n&gt;\u201cConsolidated EBITDA\u201d shall mean, for any period, Consolidated Net Income for such period (without giving effect to (w)\u00a0any extraordinary gains or losses, (x)\u00a0any non-cash income, (y)\u00a0any gains or losses from sales of assets other than those assets sold in the ordinary course of business, or (z)\u00a0any foreign currency gains or losses) adjusted by (A)\u00a0adding thereto (in each case to the extent deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period (other than clause (ix)\u00a0below which need not be so deducted)), without duplication, the amount of (i)\u00a0total interest expense (inclusive of amortization or write-off of deferred financing fees and other original issue discount and banking fees, charges and commissions (e.g., letter of credit issuance and facing fees (including Letter of Credit Fees and Facing Fees), commitment fees, issuance costs and other transactional costs)) of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (ii)\u00a0provision for taxes based on income and foreign withholding taxes for the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries (including state, franchise, capital and similar taxes paid or accrued) determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iii)\u00a0all depreciation and amortization expense of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iv)\u00a0in the case of any period, the amount of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction (including in connection with any amendments to the Credit Documents) during such fiscal quarter, (v)\u00a0any unusual or non-recurring cash charges, (vi)\u00a0any cash restructuring charges or reserves (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include retention, severance, system establishment costs, excess pension charges, contract and lease termination costs and costs to consolidate facilities and relocate employees) for such period (a)(x) incurred in connection with an Acquisition consummated after the Effective Date or (y)\u00a0otherwise incurred in connection with the Company\u2019s and its Consolidated Subsidiaries\u2019 operations in an aggregate amount for all cash charges added back pursuant to this clause (vi)\u00a0not to exceed 15% of Consolidated EBITDA in any Test Period (calculated before giving effect to this clause (vi)), (vii) any expenses incurred in connection with any actual or proposed Investment, incurrence, amendment or repayment of Indebtedness, issuance of Equity Interests or acquisition or disposition, in each case, outside the ordinary course of business for such period, (viii)\u00a0expenses incurred to the extent covered by indemnification provisions in any agreement in connection with an acquisition to the extent reimbursed in cash to the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries and such indemnification payments are not otherwise included in Consolidated Net Income, in each case, for such period, (ix)\u00a0proceeds received by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries from any business interruption insurance to the extent such proceeds are not otherwise included in such Consolidated Net Income for such period, (x)\u00a0all other non-cash charges of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (xi) \\[RESERVED\\], and (xii)\u00a0any expenses associated with stock based compensation and (B)\u00a0subtracting therefrom (to the extent not otherwise deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period)\u00a0(i) the amount of all cash payments or cash charges made (or incurred) by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries for such period on account of any non-cash charges added back to Consolidated EBITDA pursuant to preceding sub-clause (A)(x) in a previous period and (ii)\u00a0any unusual or non-recurring cash gains. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that, to the extent any amounts are excluded from Consolidated Net Income by virtue of the proviso to the definition thereof contained herein, any add backs to Consolidated Net Income in determining Consolidated EBITDA as provided above shall be limited (or denied) in a fashion consistent with the proviso to the definition of Consolidated Net Income contained herein\n\nYowza. That's a mouthful, huh? So in this bullshit alphabet soup are some key phrases that we are going to look at to see how businesses can manipulate their YOY figures to appear a bit... better than they would be otherwise. There are your normal should be in there things too, but most is bullshit. Let's pick out the five big ones. My comments on how these can be manipulated are in ALL CAPS after each one.\n\n(1) Transaction costs (with respect to both closing date transactions and other permitted transactions) THIS BASICALLY MEANS THEY CAN SPEND HOWEVER MUCH MONEY THEY WANT ON WHATEVER THEY WANT AS LONG AS IT'S ALLOWED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THEY CAN ADD IT BACK. THEY CAN ALSO INCLUDE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LAWYERS (BECAUSE WE'RE EXPENSIVE), ACCOUNTANTS, CONSULTANTS, WITCH DOCTORS, STRIPPERS... YOU GET THE IDEA. THIS IS ONE WAY THAT CASHFLOW NEGATIVE COMPANIES CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EBITA - YOU SPEND EVERYTHING ON MORE SHIT AND YOU GET CREDITED FOR IT. TSLA ARE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A COMPANY THAT WOULD USE THIS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT MODE. ALL THAT CRAZY SHIT ELON DOES THAT PISSES AWAY MONEY WOULD GO RIGHT HERE AS A CREDIT TO THE BUSINESS.\n\n(2) Cash restructuring charges / reserves (capped at 15% of EBITDA) DOWNSIZING, CONSOLIDATION, FURLOUGHING PEOPLE, PAYING TO GET PEOPLE KILLED - IF IT MEANS A CHANGE TO YOUR BUSINESS THAT INVOLVES MOVING PEOPLE AROUND OR GETTING RID OF THEM, YOU CAN ADD IT BACK HERE. SAME GOES FOR CASH RESERVES YOU'VE ESTABLISHED. GET A DOUBLE CREDIT FOR SPENDING **AND** NOT SPENDING MONEY!\n\n(3) Pro forma cost savings projected to be realized from any material business acquisition (exceeding &gt; of $60 million / 1% of total assets) THIS ONE IS ALWAYS FUNNY TO ME. THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU BUY SOMETHING THAT COMPLEMENTS YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS, EVEN IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTIVELY LOSING MONEY, YOU CAN GET A CREDIT FOR THE SYNERGIES IT WILL HAVE WITH YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS. COMBINE WITH ADDBACK (1) ABOVE FOR A REALLY GOO TIME - DOUBLE DIP ON BUYING CASH BURNING BUSINESSES AND JUST TELL PEOPLE IT'S SYNERGISTIC. WOO, FISCAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING!\n\n(4) extraordinary losses PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. IF SOMETHING FEELS WEIRD TO YOU, YOU CAN PROBABLY ADD IT BACK HERE. THERE IS NO BASELINE FOR THIS. IT'S WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE AT ANY POINT IN TIME AND THE BANK CAN'T STOP YOU.\n\n(5) unusual and/or non-recurring cash charges WHERE YOU CLAIM WRITEOFFS FOR YOUR CEO'S WIFE'S BOYFRIEND'S SECRET FAMILY IN OMAHA'S CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. YOU CAN SERIOUSLY USE THIS FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU CAN SAY IT'S (I) NOT SOMETHING YOU'D DO EVERY DAY AND (II) IT PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. INTERESTINGLY SOME BUSINESSES ARE TRYING TO CLAIM CORONA-RELATED CREDITS HERE TO STEER THEM THROUGH THIS EARNINGS SEASON WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH NEGATIVE EBITDA.\n\nThis is just $TSLA, and honestly their definition isn't even that complicated. Seriously - go to your favorite ticker's 10-K, find the credit agreement, and CTRL+F \"Consolidated EBITDA\" and \"Consolidated Net Income\". Try and read it for yourself and tell me if you think that makes up anything other than a shitty madlib - let alone a real performance metric for a business.\n\nAnyway. That's today's post. $LYV breakdown later in the week. $LULU on Friday.\n\nFuzzy",

        "selftext": "On behalf of u/jartek, u/Arigold212855 and all the mods, we want to acknowledge and give thanks to EVERYONE that has been a part of WSB throughout the years! We are all very grateful and humbled at this amazing community of autists. YOU ARE ALL APPRECIATED. THANK YOU!\n\nWithin the past year there have been a lot of changes within the WSB community and to be honest, we have done a lousy job effectively communicating these changes in a way that is transparent and inclusive of our members. As a result of this, we know that a lot of you are frustrated and unsure of what is taking place and what the future holds for WSB.\n\nWe want to address each major change and issue with transparency and thoroughness:\n___\n\n- **The Creation of the New Discord Server and Stricter Rules Within It.**\n\nA certain level of \u201cchaos\u201d has helped WSB thrive. It\u2019s a huge part of what attracts members and attention and it\u2019s something WE ALL LOVE! The previous Discord server started off with that level of chaos that has made WSB great, but then took a sharp turn towards something else entirely. \n\nFor a long time, we have had reports of frequent and large-scale incidents of racism, acts of hate and pornographic content that appeared to include minors were taking place within that Discord server. There was an effort made to communicate with the mods on that server some of which were mods on the WSB sub, but we were never able to fully confirm what if any actions were being taken to mitigate these things from happening and eventually made the decision to separate and create a new Discord server and implement stricter rules and a zero-tolerance policy for all aforementioned content.\n___\n- **The Release of Jartek\u2019s Book**\n\nThe creation, publishing, and sale of this book was a way to increase awareness of what WSB is, how it got started and what makes it the top financial community online today, by far, as told by the person who created the WHOLE THING! \n\nTHANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT SUPPORTED THE BOOK!\n___\n- **Creation and Sudden Replacement of the WSB Logo.**\n\nWE LOVED THE OLD LOGO and did not want to change it! We had no choice. While it\u2019s true the individual who claimed to have made this logo for us said we could keep using it this same individual, unfortunately, STOLE IT from someone else\u2019s TED talk presentation many years ago. The more exposure the WSB received the greater chance of cease and desist notices to continue. To not fight what would have been a losing battle and at the advice of our lawyers, we abruptly changed the logo to what it is now. \n\nHere is the \u201csilver lining\u201d: we\u2019ll be allowing ANYONE that wants to contribute to a new logo to do so, as we will be redesigning what\u2019s there. More details soon! (a couple of days). \n___\n- **The WSB Championship Trading Competition and True Trading Group as a sponsor.**\n\nFirst off, we ALL fully acknowledge this was announced terribly, lacking transparency and member inclusion, and we\u2019re about to rectify that. Not because we must, but because WE ALL GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ALL OF YOU!\n\nThis event will be the way WSB publicly kicks down the doors of finance, its communities and shakes it all to its core! This will be the way WSB lets the world know we\u2019re more than a subreddit, we are a fucking financial movement, and this is how we GET SHIT DONE!\n\nThis event will be the first ever E-sports style LIVE trading event where contestants risk their own money at a chance to win a large cash prize that FAR supersedes the money they are risking.\n\nThink \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d type announcing with WSB brand of chaos while contestants risk losing it all or making sweet, sweet tendies!\n\nWe are compiling a detailed Q&amp;A list and FULL video that explains the rules of the competition and all other details that we will be launching soon. Once launched, we will do a full AMA for the sub and Discord.\n___\n- **On the topic of True Trading Group as a Sponsor**\n\nHistorically, services like True Trading Group have been BANNED from WSB and for good reasons, that we\u2019re all aware of. \n\n**HOWEVER**\n\nThe owners of TTG reached out to jartek 8 months ago and instead of offering money to him or other mods to shill their version of a \u201cmillionaire-making trading community/service,\u201d they took the approach of asking him if he would take some time and give them his opinion on what they had built. \n\nu/jartek accepted and WARNED them that 10,000 other people have tried to shill garbage on WSB over the years and ALL have failed because all were bullshit and all cared more about making money via burning and churning the selling of a \u201cdream\u201d than actually providing ANY VALUE WHATSOEVER! u/jartek also stated to them that IF he found this to be the same that this would be a costly mistake for TTG as a company and they accepted.\n\nu/jartek\u2019s initial thoughts were cautiously optimistic and as time went by, he saw that not only was this not bullshit but it had real value!\n\nThe conversation of the WSB Championship came up and the idea that was floated around and what eventually was put into action was, TTG has committed to a substantial cash prize and WSB would introduce TTG to its community and ANY AND ALL SALES that came from that, WSB would receive 30% of the GROSS REVENUE and ALL 30% would be used for additional prize money for the event! WSB will make its money from ticket sales and PPV, NOT off of TTG sales!\n\nTrue Trading Group exists to help truly educate traders of all skill levels and types with regard to both stocks and options, to help them learn, trade and profit within a community of pro-traders and others like themselves. \n\nThe content TTG provides is not a \u201cget rich quick gimmick,\u201d it\u2019s legit. There are real lessons that are followed by exams, tons of exclusive video content, real-time DD tools which include filings, free analyst reports and soon, real-time LEVEL 2 via their partnership with QuoteMedia.\n\nRegardless, if you are just getting started with trading or you\u2019re an expert, TTG provides clear and concise education, profitable and transparent trade alerts and support to all members.\n\nu/jartek and I are now in the TTG chatroom daily to help welcome all members of WSB looking for a more educational and focused approach to trading stocks and options. \n\nBottom Line: We have done the research on TTG for 8 months and feel 100% comfortable allowing them to be our sponsor on this event. We hope that the WSB community can give it a fair try and then\u2026 provide real feedback for all. If you sign up for TTG and have a negative opinion you will NEVER be silenced. Comments will not be deleted because of negative opinions and they don\u2019t want that either. What they do want is constructive and real feedback to help add value to their members. \n\n**HOWEVER**\n\nThose who attempt to harm or discredit their business on anything that is not based on facts that can be proven will be BANNED! YOU have something negative to say? COOL say it\u2026 but back it up\u2026 and try and be constructive, this is not a huge ask from us\u2026 \n\nFor Those Who Are Open to Giving TTG a Chance Click the Link Below and Use Code \u201cWSBTTG\u201d to Save 30%\n\nClick Here: https://truetradinggroup.com/wallstreetbets/?cc=WSBTTG&amp;cp=30\n___\n- **The Future of WSB** \n\nWSB has been everyone\u2019s secret underground finance community where chaos flourishes and high-risk high-reward is the name of the game.\n\nIt is undeniable that the WSB community is growing at a very quick rate. That growth brings about change and we are aware that MOST people, including all of us, HATE CHANGE!\n\nHOWEVER\n\nWe will be transparent including you ALL as we grow and evolve in an effort to not lose touch with the members that have made this community what it is today. Far more important than any monetization effort or \u201cbusiness\u201d is the community of autists that have been here supporting us the whole time!\n\nThere will be no more ideas that are \u201csprung on you last minute or by surprise.\u201d We will include and discuss our growth strategies with you via the sub and Discord. THIS DOES NOT MEAN EVERYONE GETS A VOTE but it DOES MEAN WE WILL CONSIDER ALL FEEDBACK AS WE GROW. \n___\nONE LAST THING:\n\nIn addition to the above issues which we have addressed at length in this thread, there are other \u201cissues\u201d such as conspiracy theories and rumors. What we have to say on this will be kept brief because all of it is asinine and it\u2019s not worth a large response, here you go:\n\n- EVERY SINGLE DETAIL about jartek, his family, anything about MJ Stocks is a fascinating but 100% FICTION. Although we were all impressed and frankly a bit afraid that someone took the time to put so much effort into what is 100% a troll\u2026 but \u201cA\u201d for effort\u2026 lol\n\nGoing Forward On this Topic:\n\n- If you are a part of the WSB community and want to see it move forward in a way that works for everyone, you won\u2019t be spreading FALSE information or doxing ANYONE! Those that do will be banned immediately.\n\n- If you have a question, NO MATTER what the topic about, anything regarding the WSB or those that run it, etc\u2026 PLEASE feel free to ask. YOU will never be banned for asking something straight up.\n___\nIN CLOSING:\n\nWe encourage all of you to now ask us anything and we will respond to as many questions as we can, honestly.",

        "selftext": "Jk, it\u2019s going to go down.\n\nFor those retards that have been here since 2018, you\u2019ll recall that I called for a V shape rebound in the December China growth scare sell off. I\u2019m usually a big fat bull (see flair), but I have to be realistic given the landscape.\n\nThe market will have a big pivot this week on Monday to trigger a new down move. Why?\n\n1. Market is out of steam - Thursday should have been much higher following the fed announcement. One of the largest packages in history met with a whimper +1.5% when the VIX is north of 40. What does that mean? At these levels, government support is, say it with me, PRICED IN. Yes, jobless claims numbers were bad but that was known.\n\n2. Banks announce next week, and the commentary will be awful - Look, everyone knows Q2 outlook will be shit except a lucky few (amzn, zoom, cost, etc.). Management is growing to throw everything and the kitchen sink because they have a free pass this quarter. However, the reality is they don\u2019t have visibility into later in the year, let along 2021. Who is going to stick their neck out and not speak grim death with unemployment rising to 20%? Earnings is where the rubber meets the road when all the macro/emotion driven swings subside, and the reality is no one can say with confidence what the E in PE will be going forward.\n\n3. Followup to point #2. Consensus numbers from Wall Street are literally retarded. 5% earnings decline in 2020 with a rebound to $170 on the SPX in 2021. I know the market expectations are for a worse 2020, but consensus is for 2021 to exceed 2019. Show me another recession, let alone one this sharp, rebounds like that. You think animal spirits of 2019 will be back later this year after all this? It\u2019s risk off and gradual rebuild for several years. 80% of layoffs / furloughs outside of effected industries will be permanent. Effected industries will downsize as well. Main Street businesses and consumers are wiped out. Risk off, everywhere.\n\nCould I be wrong? No, I can\u2019t. We\u2019re drilling on Monday after a higher open, bookmark this.\n\nFor you retards who were stubborn enough to hold your puts 3 weeks too early, congrats you finally made it to the other side.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it. \n\nIt's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.\n\n\\- ALPHABET -A-. Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks. \n\n\\- ARISTA NETWORKS. Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.\n\n\\- FACEBOOK. This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy. \n\n\\- GALAPAGOS. To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences. \n\n\\- INCYTE GENOMICS. Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%\n\n\\- LULULEMON ATHLETICA. Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase. \n\n\\- MASTERCARD. Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.\n\n\\- MICROSOFT. No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices. \n\n\\- NVIDIA. Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars. \n\n\\- VEEVA SYSTEMS. One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.\n\nOne last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.\n\nHope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!\n\nTL;DR. Stonks only go up.",

        "selftext": "Ok so a lot of you have to be sitting here wondering why the fuck this market refuses to go down, why your tendies are burnt, etc. Well I want to kind of try and take a second to explain how I see things here from a macro and micro, and why I think the rug pull is coming on this bear market rally very soon.\n\nLet's start by going macro a bit.\n\n**Phase 1**\n\nFor many, when the virus hit the ferociousness at which it gripped not only the markets but society as a whole caught a lot of people flat footed - like Ray Dalio's fund ( [https://www.ft.com/content/6addc002-6666-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3](https://www.ft.com/content/6addc002-6666-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3) ).\n\nThe market turned so quickly and violently as people rushed to sell everything that it created massive losses for the funds... thats right this is where we get to some brrrrrrrr'ing.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\nWhen we look at the reversal its a violent short squeeze due in part to fed liquidity action and the impact on balance sheets for big companies.\n\nBasically they came in hard with the liquidity from the Fed, which was in the form of the corporate bond debt that they bought up. (See late march run ups in the corporate bonds market - $LQD) What few retail investors (fuck I learned this myself a few weeks back) realize is that companies like Apple, for example, who have a shit ton of \"cash\" on there balance sheet actually oftentimes have a balance of both cash and corporate debt ( [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/why-apple-sold-debt-despite-having-lots-of-cash-2019-9-1028503164](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/why-apple-sold-debt-despite-having-lots-of-cash-2019-9-1028503164) ), and its not just corporates that own these assets - hedge funds do too. This is what is traded with things like LQD. When the Fed stepped in they revved the fuck up on that printer just buying all that debt from any fucking seller that existed. This caused LQD to moon, and injected a fuck load more cash into the market which is where phase two of this craziness begins, when market sentiment peaked on the panic side, they pushed in hard, and forced a MASSIVE up bound short squeeze. Important to note that options volume has been down since that quad witching, but that's somewhat normal. Interesting as well is how \"orderly\" this movement has seemed, both suppressing VIX while jumping 20% from the lows... an important number for....\n\n**Phase 3 - Reality Rug Pull**\n\nNow, you might have noticed that some of those same managers that have helped push us up to this close have started getting a lot more bearish (i.e. realistic) with their statements, folks like Janet Yellen and Jamie Dimon calling this a massive recession and possible depression just this week (Actually Ray Dalio just came out and called it \"The Great Depression\" as well -  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandrasternlicht/2020/04/08/ray-dalio-were-heading-into-a-great-depression/#71cbd2a97c83](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandrasternlicht/2020/04/08/ray-dalio-were-heading-into-a-great-depression/#71cbd2a97c83) ). Consensus has shifted to a -30% 2Q GDP, meanwhile they are waiving a red curtain at the market frothing it up.\n\n*Today they got RIGHT where they wanted, a 20% retracement from the lows - i.e. a technical bull market.*\n\nNow this leads to the rug pull.\n\n*Lets dive in micro*\n\nToday was especially low volume actually.  In fact it was the lowest volume day since March 5 on the NYSE ([https://twitter.com/hmeisler/status/1247992863780208640?s=20](https://twitter.com/hmeisler/status/1247992863780208640?s=20)) Part of this is because the market is waiting on a couple of news pieces, yes. But mainly they are leveraging this week which is the one week reprieve in earnings reports to top off their long returns from the dip before this upcoming rug pull.\n\n**Some Brief Amateur TA**\n\nI'm by no means a pro analyst here but I took a stab at analyzing what's going on here:\n\nImportant notes from today:\n\n1. We challenged, unsuccessfully at close, the shooting star pattern established yesterday. If we had closed above the high, we would be still aiming bullish in the short run.\n2. Tomorrow and this weekend are critical.\n\nAs you can see we are approaching the intersection channel here between the simple lows and highs trend lines on the 180 day chart. Likely if we finish to the downside of that yellow line when they cross, we are good and should begin the technical down turn, which may not be super sharp but should exceed the lows as we continue through Q2.\n\nOne very intriguing note. Take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/cbd5NRH). That's yesterday's daily candle, which formed a potential shooting star.\n\nSome of you may have seen some talk about how yesterday (4/7) the daily chart showed a rare pattern known as a shooting star. Basically we needed to close below yesterday to fully confirm it, but instead we closed just below the previous high - which actually doesn't invalidate the bearish pattern. How narrowly did we avoid closing over? By about 15 minutes.\n\n*Now* [Look at the 1m charts from today's close.](https://imgur.com/F8aMNXe) See the high candle? Look familiar? Today in the 1m charts we **technically** did have a completed shooting star that you can see pushed us down.\n\nNow take a quick look at the [RSI on a 15 day scale](https://imgur.com/KlCQrtO). As you can see we are topping into over bought territory... again right at the 20% technical bull market retracement. The water is frothy and that's just how the MM want it.\n\nThe Rug pull will have likely they are waiting on either (a) something like Boris dying to push the market sentiment down or (b) a final run up (maybe, and small) on the OPEC news tomorrow back to 275-280 before pulling the rug.\n\n*If I could wager a guess, I believe that we see a really big sell off into the long weekend, and provided we don't come up with a cure over it or have some other excessively large amount of good news*\n\n*Next week the market cannot hide from reality. Earnings reports for Q1 begin to be released, including Delta Airlines, which will be viewed as a bellweather in this market - especially after Buffet sold his stake. The blood will be in the water. I see two ways for it to play out from there either a slow bleed to the new lows like 2008, or we violently snap back down as the market stops being able to run from the economic realities at hand.*\n\n**TL;DR -** The market has been squeezing you dry for the last few weeks, this is NOT a bull market now - thinking so is just recency bias. All the forces add up to this run being an epic short squeeze followed by an epic rug pull reversal. This is fake liquidity that has propped the market up. HOLD YOUR PUTS, roll them back as we go down.\n\nSPY 210p 6/19\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: OH!** One really important bit! Ha - I think that OPEC+ is likely priced in as far as the big money is concerned. Essentially the amount of cuts discussed don't do too much to ease the fact that demand is zilch - theres oversupply right now and there will be even with a production cut. We have been expecting this for weeks, its a moving target. I genuinely think as well theres a chance the Saudis say fuck you and decide to curb stomp US shale but thats a whole 'nother thing.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nOh well would you look at that! Bloomberg now has us at 100% chance of recession. https://twitter.com/davidinglestv/status/1248020033155952641?s=21",

You have to not give in to fear but also not be so retarded to hold a position that is lost and has no chance. And for god sakes guys please take profits. The reason I got this far is that I took my profits. I didn\u2019t wait until 5000%. \n\nI also found that trading end of day and selling in the morning was by far my most profitable trades. Play swings that happen over night.

        "selftext": "**So if you are here for a lotto jackpot 20x position. downvote this and move along. But if, you are here and looking for a sustainable way to generate cash, keep reading.**\n\nFirst, There isn't any good in being perma bears or bulls that is so fucking stupid the only gang that you want to join is **PRINTING GANG**.\n\nSecond, This is what I made today [+1,193.36](https://i.imgur.com/zPHP6fv.jpg), you see how I only make 1 trade? I don't see any entry point so I didn't do anything all day, Sometime BEST POSITION IS NO POSITION and This year so far [+$425,443.23](https://i.imgur.com/AJpVbm1.png) which on average I made 3.42% per trade so **DON'T GET FUCKING GREEDY** and **TAKE THE MOTHERFUCKING PROFIT**. Not every trade is a win, you can't win them all but if you can make 3.5% per trade and you do that 20 times in a day. You will double your initial money. I did that many times [Sample 1](https://i.imgur.com/4bAg7BQ.jpg) [Sample 2] (https://i.imgur.com/4RsOUtZ.jpg).\n\nThird, During high VIX time. The only 2 ways to make money which either YOU SELL THE OPTIONS or YOU DAY TRADE. If you don't have $25k then I'm sorry this game is not for you.\n\nFourth, I have day traded options for about 14 years since I was 22. Right now the market is **ONCE IN A LIFETIME** opportunity. Like my man EMINEM once said *\"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity, To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment, Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo\"* so don't let it fucking slip.\n\n**DO**\n\n - Get in and get out don't be fucking greedy.\n - Have an entry and exit price in mind before you open the fucking trade. So learn how to cut losses and take the profit.\n - If you made a bad trade. Get the fuck out, cut losses and try again, Don't fucking bagholding it and pray. God is not real. Santa is also not real.\n - Learn your greeks if you don't know what it is just fucking BING IT.\n - Once you have closed your position. Just fucking forget about it. Don't look back. Move on to the next trade. HINDSIGT IS ALWAYS 20/20.\n - Keep in your mind that if you trading options without any underlying then you are **GAMBLING**. This is not investing and stop calling your bankroll \"portfolio\".\n - If you are degenerate gambler like me this is what I do with my bankroll. I put whatever I feel comfortable losing in my trading account. The rest I keep in my checking account (separate institution). So when my retard brain tell me to do stupid shit, I don't lost it all. By the time I need to move more money into my bankroll, my head will be cleared (hopefully) and stop doing stupid shit.\n\n**DON'T**\n\n - **DON'T GAMBLE MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE** It's sad that I have to say this. Use the fucking money on important first, rent, mortgage, car payment, food, etc.\n - DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT be **H**orrified **O**f **M**issing **O**ut. Just remember that it is better making no money than losing money so assess the market before make a fucking trade.\n - Don't fucking all in, this is not a world poker series. There is no such a thing as a sure trade.\n - Don't take any DD with face vaule. DO YOUR OWN FUCKING RESEARCH. DD on here is just your starting point. It stands for DUE DILIGENCE for christ sake not DONE DEAL.\n - If you win on one trade. It is already your money. Don't use your tard brain and think that now you are gambling with a house money.\n - Don't be a MONEY HATER person. Let's say your position drop 50%, assess it. Imagine that if you have the money now, Would you get in to this position at this market price. If the answer is no, then cut the loss and exit the position. **IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU PAID FOR IT** What matter is what it will be in the future.\n - Stop using fucking robinhood and use any real broker. I use Charlie's most of my trading friend use IBKR\n - Don't be fucking poor go find $25,000 and day trade if you don't have $25,000 then go live your live until you have it.\n\n\n**THE BS**\n\n - Yeah you head it before \"Scared money don't make no money\" but what if I tell you \"Stupid money also don't make no money\" So please DD before you get in any position.\n - **DIAMOND HAND** is fucking **STUPID** concept. Get that out of your system, STAT! If you think your position will loss value and you will just diamond hand through it, don't you dumb fuck. Just sell and buy back when it is cheaper!\n - NOONE fucking knows where the market will go. I repeat NOONE! So don't fucking fall for the scam.\n - TA is standing for Technical Astrology so if you need a book I recommend [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Only-Astrology-Book-Youll-Ever-ebook/dp/B00578T33K/ref=sr_1_3?crid=L0R6GAADG2J8&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=astrology+for+beginners&amp;qid=1586368924&amp;sprefix=astrology+for+beg%2Caps%2C194&amp;sr=8-3).\n - What goes up might not come down. What went down might not come up. YES I AM TALKING TO YOU JNUGGER!\n\n**FAQ**\n\nDo you use stop loss and profit exit?\n\n - Yes, Stop at 7% and exit at 5% but most of the time I exit or cut loss before it hits. Except for the position I open at EOD.\n\nWhat indicator do you use?\n\n - Macro economic news and trade from experience (ie just wing it). I DON'T USE TA. Just RSI and Volume.\n\nWho the fuck use bing?\n\n - I do because it is free money [BING REWARD MOTHERFUCKER!](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards?rtc=1)\n\nIt easy for you coz you have the money.\n\n - I immigrated to the US when I was 15 with $100 my uncle gave me. Did not go to highschool and busing tables when I was 17. So everyone starts somewhere.\n\nWhat is your next move?\n\n - Doggy style on your mom. Do you own fucking DD.\n\nCan I pay you to guide/mentor me?\n\n - Holy fuck no! I will create a trading group though, $1500/mo and will name it \"FALSE TRADING GROUP\".\n\nWhat should I do with this xxxx positions?\n\n - Shove it up your ass.\n\nBan and Fuck you!\n\n - Hey, Fuck you too.\n\nGood fucking luck and Happy Gambling\n\nps. make all the $60k joke I lost last year all you want but for all 14 years I only have 3 negative years which are the first two and last year.",

        "selftext": "We were all ready in a bubble due to low interest rates before this started. Junk bonds were only fetching 4%. There were huge pools of collateralized loan obligations made up of junk rate covenant light leverage loans.Housing prices had outpace growth in income and rents by margins akin to 2005-7. The US government was running a $1T deficit during an expansion, and now it will run a $3.2T deficit.  \n\n\nBut stonks are booming. Even if this shit started to get cured tomorrow, we'd have major swaths shut down through mid-May, and a month of reopening. Unemployment is 12.7% in my state, headed to 20% by early May. Our unemployment insurance trust will run out in 6 weeks at this rate. State and local budgets are shot.  \n\n\nBut we've reinflated to what was already bubble levels. Why?  \n\n\nAll I can think of:  \n1. The big risk before was corporate debt. The Fed is basically promising to buy into junk debt and ensure no one can fail.  \n\n\n2. Because people know inflation won't kick off right away due to all the unemployment, they aren't afraid (yet) that 4-5% inflation turns basically every bond and fixed income security issued from 2009-2020 into negative real yield toxic shit.  \n\n\n3. As more info comes out, 80% of tax breaks in the stimulus went to people with over $1M incomes. The 10% of households own 88% of all stonks, so they will do the best out of all of this. The rich can pump into the market because they know the government won't let it fail (this also means trillions are being pumped to make sure the top 10% get theirs, even if this means Social Security and Medicare are getting fucked). Fixed income was already shit low and with inflation it will become negative yield. Stonks will at least gain value some day.  \n\n\n4. Institutions are desperately trying pair losses buying back in for a rally they know won't last.  \n\n\nBut still, I don't fucking get it.",

        "selftext": "Now more than ever, banks, hedge funds, fudge packers, brokers, you name it, is leveraged beyond belief. All of them are autists buying everything they can on margin to make bank bro, and they don\u2019t want to hold any cash because it\u2019s not printing tendies. So they buy bonds, treasuries, etc. to print them small returns instead of holding cash. They are illiquid as hell. \n\nWhen the market crashed, a lot of these guys, specifically hedge funds, got caught with their smelly panties down and were at risk of getting margin called or did get margin called and the whole fucking thing was about to crash down. The market would have went down another 25%. They had no cash and the repo market had no demand, because any cash that people did have, no one wanted to lend it out because the economy was fucked (still is). In short, think of a repo as when a hedge fund wants cash real quick to buy a call option on Tesla but all their cash is tied up in other equities. So they put the treasury bonds or any other securities on the repo market and they get cold hard cash through a repurchase agreement and make bank on their Tesla call and then give the money back to the issuer of the cash, plus interest. \n\nSo now, JP said how do I stop this free fall and get the markets back in order. I bring back demand for the repo market so hedge funds can get liquid again and start buying up equities with options and make a fuckin killing while all of us cheer on our girlfriends getting railed by their boyfriends, and cry about the lack of tendies from our puts. \n\nSo JP started injecting trillions into the repo market and hedge funds lended out their securities for loads on cold hard cash, bought equities hand over fist, and stopped the market free fall while making a shit load of money on the rebound. Win-win, the fed stopped the bleeding and got paid back on their loan because the hedge funds made bank on the bounce, and a win to the hedge funds because they were saved again from defaulting and now have cash (reserves) to play with and make even more tendies. \n\nSo JP stopped arguably the biggest leveraged/default crash we have ever seen next to the housing crisis overnight by directly engaging in repurchase agreements with hedge funds. Hedge funds/Pension Funds drive the market. \n\nNow that hedge funds are liquid again, they will soon start closing their long positions and go short, because let\u2019s be real, the economy is fucked beyond belief right now and hedge funds are in the business of making lots of tendies. Not much more room to go up, but plenty to go down. JP only stepped in to avoid the banks and hedge funds getting fucked, and once banks are fucked, no one gets any more loans and we all eat shit. Now that those dealers are liquid again, the markets should start to play out as they should when you have 17M unemployed in 3x weeks, no consumer activity, corporations maxing out credit lines about to issue stock at depressed values, and US oil going bankrupt. \n\nSo, hang on to those puts. Hedge funds love making bank bro, and the fastest way to do that is playing the downside. As long as the dealers (banks, hedge funds) don\u2019t get too leveraged again and have access to cash, then JP is going to have to watch the market slow bleed. \n\nNotice on Wednesday/Thursday we started to see some major drops and selling. That is hedge funds taking billions in profits and ready to reverse course for utter destruction. Next week we start the fall. You can count on it.",

        "selftext": "I've called 3 major reversals and 1 short term one last week (check my post history) and I'm here to tell you we might be in for another major reversal.\n\nPrice has attempted, three times, to break resistance at SPY 264. 264 is a super significant number, and it's very typical for price to get stuck at a significant number and reverse at said super significant number.\n\nFirst, $264 is the 200 Week moving average. The 200 week moving average has been support for this entire bull market - 9 fucking years!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qe68eao0jbr41.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2640b176655d0341604e956532613eed2af27490\n\nSecond, it's the .382 Fib of the entire price decline from the all time high. The two line up perfectly. When a structural support and a major fib line up, it's like wearing two condoms during gay sex - little jimmy has to work way harder to impregnate your boyfriend's sister's husband.\n\n![img](7od46vbjibr41 \"Second, it's the .382 Fib of this entire decline.\n\")\n\nNow look at the price action: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6be97modjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ddf004701b380f9f67e8ec6f3797dea975dd4a\n\nIn a bull market, this would be hella bullish price action - price banging on the door, eventually breaking it down. But we're not in a bull market are we? Hellllll no we're not.\n\nIn a bull market, an impulse gap like the one we had this morning above a previous short term trend of the previous move (see the red line drawn from the ATH) would be on high volume.\n\nCheck out this pitiful volume today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwkoouzxjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e55cad6e16a52e32f68c14a581211ce8222f05d0\n\nJust sad, sad volume for a gap impulse.\n\nFinally, factor in where we closed. RIGHT at the 200 weekly MA. Not above it. the final minute saw HUGE sell volumes into the close. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v71xmxsbkbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a134ebbc82de1050f2cd145df0e8dacb25a577\n\nNow look, I'm not saying price can't continue up further. It absolutely could. There have been enormous short positioned established in the past two weeks which will put upward pressure on prices and could carry price to $270-280 if we break above $264 with high volume.\n\nBUT, if we fail here for the THIRD time. The selling is going to be absolutely vicious. 20 day realized volatility is 100. ONE FUCKING HUNDRED. UNFUCKING PRECEDENTED. The VIX is currently at 43 after a 7% SPY move. These are unfuckingprecedented times people.\n\nLike all TA gays, I'm here to tell you that price could go up, but there's an absolutely beautiful technical setup for a massive implosion.",

        "selftext": "Greetings my fellow clan of delinquent compatriots. I made a post 3 weeks ago regarding how to avoid IV crush during this recent market rally. The link to that can be found here: [Don't Scream \"GUH\", Avoid IV Crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmshcv/when_market_bounce_inevitably_comesdont_scream/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). That trade worked out well, and I am back. \n\nToday, I am back with a follow-up for navigating the road ahead. **This post is not about** ***why*** **the market will potentially retest the lows, but rather** ***how*** **to maximize profit and limit downside risk should the move down occur.** Just as the vega-neutral post focused on volatility trades, this one explores vol strategies further. I tried to substitute words with pictures for the illiterate inclined. \n\nFor solid DD on where the market is going, view u/Variation-Separate or u/scarvesandsuspenders recent posts. I do believe that sitting at either the 50% or potential near term 61.8% retracement will trigger the next leg down, and this post is about how to capitalize on that through volatility. \n\n**At best, you will get a trade idea (other than $SPY puts / $SPY straddles). At worst, you will gain some solid understanding of volatility and how it applies to you. My goal in this post is to take a pretty abstract concept and break it down so that we can all become more profitable.** Take 5 minutes, read, challenge my strategy, ask questions, and achieve nirvana. Let's begin. \n\n**So You Say I Should Trade Volatility, Aye:**\n\nYes. That is exactly what I am saying. While retail traders and WSBers have been yoloing FD on TSLA and SPCE (Jan 2022 calls will print), smart money has been executing the best trade of the past decade. The trade: **Short volatility, hedged with volatility insurance.** This is done by shorting $VXX (short vol), and purchasing $VIX calls (long vol) on a rolling basis as a hedge. Depending on the time frame of your $VIX calls (weekly, quarterly, monthly), this trade has performed dramatically well. \n\nThe strategy is rooted in the belief that volatility will, over time, mean revert and decrease after spikes caused by a \"black swan.\" It is logical - option premiums on the S&amp;P 500 (for which the $VIX tracks) theoretically will never remain permanently inflated as news becomes digested. Take a look at 2008, 2000, etc - the common theme is volatility starts to **slowly** recede before the lows of the S&amp;P 500 are registered as the catalyst causes an explosion of volatility, and as the market prices in the \"black swan,\" the market naturally performs price discovery causing volatility to come down. That is not to say volatility does not continue to spike during draw-downs in equities - it does, but typically not as dramatically unless the incoming news is categorized as dramatically more significant.\n\n* u/stonksgodown made a post regarding this phenomenon, but omitted some key factors and made some bold assumptions that I wanted to counter / elaborate on.\n\n**Realized Volatility verse Implied Volatility:**\n\nImplied volatility for the broader market can be understood through $VIX. IV is forward looking, and gives us an understanding of how much the market is expecting to move over the next 30-day period (this is a simplification, but applies). Realized volatility is actual variance in price movement over a period in time. To compare the two, solve for the realized volatility over the past 30 day period (21 trading days) by taking the standard deviation, adjusted for an annualized reading. I calculated this to get updated data, and the current output is below:\n\n[RV \\/ IV 2020](https://preview.redd.it/35274i2e4as41.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=373e3068f8df94f6e4b65be3a692bd5e1c02e40a)\n\nWhat we can see is that a pretty stark divergence has occurred, with realized vol moving higher than implied vol. This negative spread relationship is counter-intuitive. Think about it. **If IV is forward looking, it should be trading at a premium to where RV is currently trading at because we need to account for the uncertainty in the future variance of the markets.** \n\nThis is not the first time this has happened. It occurred in 2002, in 2008, and in a few periods of high volatility since the GFC. \n\n[RV \\/ IV 2008](https://preview.redd.it/ujrsn6wh4as41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3692b766c961835a5f85953643181f87d8907ae)\n\n[RV \\/ IV Collection](https://preview.redd.it/lfgm3wfj4as41.png?width=669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=316882d12d5ddaebf7eb0a59480e648999aec947)\n\nThe important theme is that, over time, the relationship eventually returns to normalcy. That is, overtime either realized vol decreases, implied vol increases, or a combination of the two occurs. This is where our previous author went astray by saying this divergence requires a spike in IV - there are many ways for this imbalance to revert to normalcy. \n\nWhen RV is below IV, the market is understating the risk of a large loss. When RV is above IV, the market is clearly in distress, and it is overstating the risk of a large loss. **Put simply: RV &gt; IV, the market favors option buyers, RV &lt; IV, the market favors option sellers.** \n\nThis is huge, because it clearly articulates the opportunity cost of purchasing verse selling options. But as I highlighted before, the return to a positive IV / RV spread can occur with a decrease in RV, an increase in IV, or a combination of the two, and the time frame is murky. So, Master Skywalker, what are we going to do?\n\nLet's take a look at the $VIX futures because they can show us what the market is forecasting for expected future movement of $SPX option implied volatility. The term structure for the $VIX futures is showing mad backwardation - that is, the future settlement dates are trading well below the current spot price. In WSB terms, the futures market is implying $VIX will continue to fall over the next 8 months.\n\n[$VIX Futures Term Structure](https://preview.redd.it/1xbj1x1m6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcb4ea8ff11c7221b9166885571b1c5f112ee503)\n\n**The Volatility Trade, Applied Right Now:**\n\nWe are presented with 3 potential outcomes:\n\n* Realized Vol Decreases (requires $VIX to decrease or trade narrowly)\n* Implied Vol Increases\n* A combination of the two over time (most likely outcome)\n\nThe issue is - Realized Vol has already happened, so how do we speculate on this? By using a similar concept to a reverse calendar spread. **The trade:** \n\nShort $VIX Futures with Settlement for Sept 2020 ($VXU20) - **Bet that RV Decreases Over 5 Month Period**\n\n* Or just short $VXX\n\nLong $VIX calls: $VIX call, 45 strike, $3.90 ask, expiring 6/17/20 - **Bet that IV Increases Over 2 Month Period**\n\nNote: I recognize that most of you do not have access to futures or even shorting for that matter, which is why I will also present a solid hybrid trade, but hear me out.\n\nWhat this does: $VIX futures with further settlement dates, while less liquid, are less sensitive to short-term spikes in the $VIX. This trade is a bet that implied volatility through September will be decreasing in aggregate. The $VIX calls with short-term settlement dates are implemented to hedge my short $VIX futures, and capitalize on any potential increase in IV moving forward should we retest the lows in $SPY. **This trade let's me bet on a short-term decrease in $SPY (and related spike in $VIX), while hedging with a longer-term bet that volatility will decrease.** It is essentially a volatility strangle with different time frames. This requires margin, and excess cash in case of margin call :)\n\n**How a Newb With a Robinhood Account Can Do This:**\n\nThe simple newb approach would be a reverse calendar spread (sell long dated calls, buy short-date calls) on $VXX, but that caps our gains, and we are not here for capped gains. If you are, jump over to r/investing.\n\nI recognize that RH does not allow $VIX, let alone $VIX futures. So let's reassess the goal of this trade: We expect $SPY to retest the lows, volatility to spike in the short-term, and I want tendies to print because of this. This movement should work toward restoring a positive relationship between RV and IV. But, maybe you, like me, have cautious conviction about this trade given the Fed, US Gov stimulus, and other erroneous factors. So, with the goal of maximizing gains, and limiting losses, we are going to hedge our exposure.\n\n**The Hypothetical Hedged Vol Trade:**\n\n* Long $SVXY (inverse volatility ETP) - inverse vol AKA $VIX go down, profit go up - **Short Vol Leg**\n* Long $VXX calls, $VIX calls , or even $SVXY puts if you really wanted to - **Long Vol Leg**\n   * Can adjust the weightings to amplify exposure to short-term volatility, i.e. for every 100 shares of $SVXY on the short vol leg, purchase 2 option contracts on the long vol leg. Find a combination that satisfies your risk tolerance. Note: $SVXY tracks -0.5x the performance of short-term $VIX futures ($SPVXSP). \n* You can also just do volatility straddles / strangles, but the issue is decreasing vol tends to move very slowly, which is why avoiding theta option decay on the short vol leg is very important.\n* **Hedging is for Pussies!** If this is you - fear not, you have some options, but if you're wrong, it is really gonna hurt. \n* $SVXY Puts\n* $VXX Calls / $VIX Calls\n* $SPY Puts\n* $SPY straddle / strangle - risk IV crush, narrow trading range, theta decay etc. \n* **Note: These are just trade strategies. These are not recommendations, and many combinations of the aforementioned products can be utilized, but be sure to understand what you are investing in.** \n\nIn this scenario, we are going long $SVXY (short vol) to capture the pullback in RV overtime, and we are long $VXX calls to capture the short-term increase in IV, and to hedge our short vol exposure. **What you just did is capture really good upside opportunity while hedging away downside risk, and eliminate the chance of blowing up your account.** The reason we are hedging our long vol is because the RV / IV relationship is imbalanced, but that does not mean we are guaranteed higher IV in the short-term.\n\n**tl;dr - I expect the market to move in the direction of retesting the lows, but Fed bailout, Fiscal stimulus, and overall complacency could prevent a retest. Thus, instead of trading $SPY, consider trading volatility as the relationship between realized vol and implied vol is fucked up, and will correct itself over time. Because of this, explore going short volatility while hedging with long volatility call options. Long $SVXY, Long $VXX Calls.**\n\nAs always, discuss, challenge, ask questions and shitpost!\n\n- \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc36",

REUTERS/Remo Casilli\nIMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva painted a far bleaker picture of the social and economic impact of the new coronavirus than even a few weeks ago, noting governments had already undertaken fiscal stimulus measures of $8 trillion, but more would likely be needed.\n\nShe said the crisis would hit emerging markets and developing countries hardest of all, which would then need hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid.\n\n\u201cJust three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020,\u201d she said on Thursday in remarks prepared for delivery ahead of next week\u2019s IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings.\n\n\u201cToday, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.\u201d\n\nIf the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, the IMF expected a partial recovery in 2021, Georgieva said, but she warned the situation could also get worse.\n\n\u201cI stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook: it could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic,\u201d she said.\n\nThe IMF, which has 189 member countries, will release its detailed World Economic Outlook forecasts on Tuesday.\n\nThe novel coronavirus that emerged in China in December has raced around the globe, infecting 1.41 million people and killing 83,400, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nGeorgieva said the pandemic was hitting both rich and poor countries, but many in Africa, Asia and Latin America were at higher risk because they had weaker health systems. They were also unable to implement social distancing in their densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums.\n\nShe said investors had already removed some $100 billion in capital from those economies, more than three times the outflow seen during the same period of the global financial crisis.\n\nWith commodity prices down sharply, emerging market and developing countries would need trillions of dollars to fight the pandemic and rescue their economies, she said.\n\n\u201cThey urgently need help,\u201d she said, estimating hundreds of billions of dollars would have to be pumped in from outside sources since those governments could only cover a portion of the costs on their own, and many already had high debts.\n\nGeorgieva said it was encouraging that all governments had sprung into action, enacting some $8 trillion in fiscal measures and massive monetary measures.\n\nTo ensure a future recovery, Georgieva called for continued efforts to contain the virus and support health systems, while averting export controls that could slow the flow of vital medical equipment and food.\n\n\u201cThe actions we take now will determine the speed and strength of our recovery,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was critical to provide affected people and companies with \u201clarge, timely and targeted\u201d measures such as wage subsidies, extended unemployment benefits and adjusted loan terms, while reducing stress to the financial system.\n\nCoordinated fiscal stimulus was critical, and monetary policy should remain accommodative, where inflation remained low.\n\n\u201cThose with greater resources and policy space will need to do more; others, with limited resources will need more support,\u201d she said.\n\nThe IMF was created for times like these, and stood ready to deploy its $1 trillion in lending capacity, Georgieva said.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s executive board had approved doubling its emergency funding to $100 billion to meet the requests of over 90 countries, and staff were racing to process those requests.\n\nThe IMF was also looking at ways to provide additional liquidity support, including through creation of a new short-term liquidity line, and solutions that would allow lending even to countries whose debt was unsustainable, she said.\n\nThe IMF was also looking to increase its Catastrophe Relief and Containment Fund, which provides grants for the poorest countries to cover IMF debt service payments, to $1.4 billion from around $200 million, she said.\n\nTo further aid the poorest economies, the Fund and the World Bank were urging creditors such as China and other countries to temporarily stop collecting debt payments on their bilateral loans.",

        "selftext": "This is my post on wsbelite. Repost here for all.\n\nIMO, trading options have similarities to playing poker and in order to be successful in the long run you need to be disciplined and refrain from making common mistakes. I\u2019m going to list common mistakes and some tips here. Please suggest more. Hope we all lose less tendies!\n\n1. Refrain to trade low volume options . These contracts will have really wild bid/ask spread, or really low volume, which reduces your chance to make profit significantly. For example how can you win if you trade $ROPE 100c when the bid ask spread is $69/$96 per contract?\n2. Refrain to trade very low price options (e.g 1-10 cents) because your broker commissions will eat up a significant amount of the transactions. Think how much commissions you have to pay to buy 10000 contracts of 0.01 $ROPE 1000c which costs $10000 of premium.\n3. Refrain to buy near-dated far OTM options, because this is almost a sure way to burn your money. Even worse, even if you guess the direction right, you may still have a substantial loss. Think $PEI 500% OTM 2DTE. Btw $PEI is a great stock to own. Example: on 04/13 you bought SPY 496c 04/17 when SPY=280. On 04/14 SPY rises to 285. Guess how much you made on your call options?\n4. Know when to select OTM vs ITM options: in general: OTM is higher risk/higher return. Have some sense of OTM price movement - even when you guess the direction right, far OTM options won\u2019t make you money because of low delta. ITM is more expensive. ATM is typically a safe choice if you just want to make a directional bet.\n5. Know theta-crush. Your options will lose time-value every day, so refrain from buying short-dated options unless you know what you're doing.\n6. Know the effects of IV (VIX for SPY) on options price. Sometimes even when you guess the direction rights, you may lose money because of VIX movements. Know how to hedge for VIX movement.\n7. Refrain from using market orders when possible: limit orders will give you the price you want.\n8. Understand the margin impact of different options strategies.\n9. Understand the impact of your broker commissions.\n10. Bank management: never YOLO your entire portfolio into one position, because if you lose, there\u2019s 0% chance to make it back. Learn [http://www.thepokerbank.com/strategy/basic/bankroll-management/](http://www.thepokerbank.com/strategy/basic/bankroll-management/). If you want to get in a large (50K+) position, average in/out may be a good idea.\n11. Don't open too many positions unless you're a bot. It's hard to manage manually and easy to make mistakes.\n12. (Mostly) don't follow autist DDs that you can't explain.\n13. Learn the market hours!\n14. Options strategies can be complex to visualized. Use your broker's performance profile tool to understand the performance implications before making a trade.\n\n**Some risky options strategies that you should only do when you know what you\u2019re doing**\n\n* Naked puts, i.e. short puts: very risky especially in a recession: when the underlying crashes you\u2019ll lose lots of money\n* Synthetic shorts: i.e. long puts + sell calls, also very risky, only know when you\u2019re 90% sure of the direction.\n* Naked calls, i.e. short calls: also pretty risky if the underlying moons.\n* \u2026\n\n**Less risky options strategies:**\n\n1. Covered calls: very low risk. You hold shares, and sell OTM calls to cover them and collect the premium.\n2. Cash secured puts: sell puts but you have cash to cover it. This is good when you\u2019re willing to buy the shares if it drops, otherwise you collect the premium.\n3. Diagonal: Simultaneously entering into a long and short position in two options of the same type (two call options or two put options) but with different strike prices and different expiration dates. Typically these structures are on a 1 x 1 ratio. This is less risky and can hedge you against IV as well. For example if you bearish on USO, buy a 4p 05/15 and sell a 3.5p 04/24, that way if USO moves upward on the week ending 04/24 you\u2019ll collect the near-dated premium.\n4. Learn how to sell options. Every mistake you made as an option buyer is probably a chance for you to profit as an option-seller.\n\n**Practical tips**\n\n1. Use tools to scan top volume options. [https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders](https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders) . This can give you some confirmation.\n2. Use tools to scan unusual activity options. [https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity](https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity) Try to think why people are making that trade. Your broker also has tools to scan these.\n3. Take advantage of L2 flow data if your broker provides.\n4. Sometime when you can't make a long-term directional bet, it may be profitable to day-trade or swing-trade (hold your positions for 1-3 days).\n5. Know common ETFs:\n\n* SPY: everyone knows this. The most liquid options to trade.\n* IWM: tracks Russell 2000. Also pretty liquid. Trade this if you don't want expose to big techs.\n* Sector specific ETFs: XLE, XLF, XLC, etc. Also highly liquid.\n* Country specific ETFs: EWU, EWG, EWC, EWA, EWJ ... fairly liquid.\n* Gold: GLD\n* Silver: SLV\n* Oil: USO (make sure you really understand this; it doesn't track oil price)\n* Options of individual stocks: in general, the more liquid the underlying, the more liquid the options, e.g. AMZN, BA, FB, TSLA, ...\n\n**Tips to improve**\n\nLearn more about economics and business to improve your common sense.\n\nAdvanced topics: understand how MM works, gamma hedging, dark pool indicators, probably understand some TAs such as RSI.\n\nDay trade dynamics: power hours.\n\n**Things to debate**\n\n1. Should you use stop-loss orders or not?\n2. When to buy FDs and how much should you spend on FDs?\n3. What is the impact of the underlying delisted on put options? As example OILU closed on 03/29 [https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/MC3724/20200316/SUP\\_421079.PDF](https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/MC3724/20200316/SUP_421079.PDF)\n\n* On March 15, 2020 ProShares Capital Management LLC announced that it plans to close and liquidate ProShares UltraPro 3x Crude Oil ETF (ticker symbol: OILU) and ProShares UltraPro 3x Short Crude Oil ETF (ticker symbol: OILD). Each fund trades on NYSE Arca. The last day the funds will accept creation orders is March 27, 2020. Trading in each Fund will be suspended prior to market open on March 30, 2020. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on or about April 3, 2020 (the \u201cDistribution Date\u201d).\n* Shareholders may sell their shares of a Fund (subject to any applicable brokerage or transaction costs) until the market close on March 27, 2020. From March 30, 2020 through the Distribution Date, shares of the Funds will not be traded on NYSE Arca and there will not be a secondary market for the shares. During this period, each Fund will be in the process of liquidating its portfolio and will not be managed in accordance with its investment objective.\n* These strategies are intended to allow an Oil Fund to preserve a minimal portion of its value in the event of significant adverse movements in a Fund\u2019s benchmark. There can be no guarantee that an Oil Fund will be able to implement such strategies or that such strategies will be successful. Each Oil Fund will incur additional, potentially substantial, costs as a result of such strategies which may cause or increase tracking error and would be expected to have a substantial adverse impact on performance. Use of such strategies would cause an Oil Fund to not perform consistent with its investment objective. Furthermore, in the event that an Oil Fund\u2019s value decreases by 70% or more at any point from its prior day\u2019s NAV, as determined by the Sponsor, the Sponsor, in its sole discretion, in order to maintain the integrity of the ongoing operation of the Fund or for other reasons, may cause such Fund to liquidate some or all of its positions and, in lieu of such positions, invest such assets in cash or money market instruments. The above actions may be taken without prior notification to shareholders and would be expected to cause an Oil Fund not to perform consistent with its investment objective. Under these circumstances, consistent with its general authority, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, cause an Oil Fund to be terminated and dissolved.",

        "selftext": "Alright, my bad everyone. This last post was really lazy, and I realize that I had nothing in there this morning after waking up, and seeing 43 comments making fun of a shitpost I labeled as DD.\n\n#LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN\n\nThe initial post had one image in it, and it was apparently only after that it showed no actual information.\n\n[Here's the full image](https://i.imgur.com/NJ6gs2r.png) - It's SPY, on the one day, and we're focusing on the apparent downturn on Friday.\n\nThe reason I'm saying this is going to be a downturn, is because this sentiment is shared with multiple other stocks in the S&amp;P and elsewhere:\n\n[Here's AMD in the same time period with no settings changed.](https://i.imgur.com/lSDnSmv.png) It appears further along in its downturn.\n\n[Here's Visa with the same downturn potential.](https://i.imgur.com/BjVeGPA.png)\n\n[Here's Microsoft](https://i.imgur.com/SK0YdlV.png)\n\n[Here's Apple](https://i.imgur.com/0BFDaR2.png)\n\n[Here's GM](https://i.imgur.com/bwoVCcW.png)\n\n[Here's JPM](https://i.imgur.com/YoY0QNK.png)\n\n[Here's GS](https://i.imgur.com/r6Jqjc4.png)\n\nWhat originally got me taking a look at this is the gobs macking nature of the market, and the \"how could this possibly be up right now\" ideation which everyone has. I started taking a look at downward trends, and tried it from a week out. The key answer is: It's not. On a weekly basis, the market sentiment [is absolutely down, and appears to be falling like a rock](https://i.imgur.com/FjQST1e.png)\n\nThere's nothing really substantial about the MACD settings I have in here. They're a little more sensitive close in, and I prefer over Wilders because It seems to better predict significant movements.\n\n[When drawing support lines](https://i.imgur.com/jwbMUc4.png), taking into account the high, and moving toward the low with the opposite channel, there's a definitive direction taking place. The lower bollinger is midway through the channel, with the low indicating SPY ~190.\n\n[The four hour MACD has already crossed as of Tuesday (May 31st)](https://i.imgur.com/jPURern.png), and once the daily follows, which I am presuming it will, things are going to go down significantly. I'm envisioning an opposite reaction with at least the same force as the [bull trap which was set up here.](https://i.imgur.com/Ktmgr6v.png)\n\nTaking a look at the scale, and time on the daily, it appears that by next Friday, SPY is going to be following its 4 hour downward. It could be even closer if the oil talks do not go well. If they do, this sentiment may be pushed off until the following week.\n\nI do not recommend anybody hold calls for outside next week. I do not recommend that anyone hold stocks past next week, unless they're bull ETFs.\n\nTo explain my sentiment, we're seeing decreasing volume on most stocks. I presume this is because everyone is of the same mind: this bull trend doesn't make sense. We're going to see more COVID deaths, company production is halted, and nothing is being manufactured. There's no way for cash injections to buoy a market which is literally producing nothing. Further, the price of oil will not either. The weekly sentiment is strong down, the 4 hour is peaking down, and this is across the board on all the stocks I've listed above. SPY will eventually follow the separate stock trends, and we're going to see some amazing losses.\n\nSuggested positions:\n\n   * [AAPL - 180p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/pYKw3fD.png)\n   * [AMD - 30p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/IIZYdVp.png)\n   * [JPM - 50p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/z5DzliZ.png)\n   * [SNE - 44p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/KEBLC4Z.png)\n   * [SPY - fuck, I dunno. Maybe 190p, but 180p maybe too - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/dtMWnZm.png)\n   * [DIS - 70p? 65p? 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/PMU1DfA.png)\n   * [YUM - 40p/35p 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/3T4OKS6.png)\n   * [ALLY - they're fucked. I dunno. 6p, 4p - 15 may?](https://i.imgur.com/70ojmh9.png)\n   * [C - 15p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/W4cqqaQ.png)\n   * [GS - 100p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/3k2IW9G.png)\n\n\nOn Ally - they're probably going to go bankrupt. Most of their business is auto loan servicing, something no one has any interest in paying when they're going to need food and need to pay rent. Further, the federal government has had no discussions about auto loan bailouts. I looked into their 10k which was released in Feb, and 5/6ths of their loans are for cars. Further, 40% of those loans were made to people with a sub-700 credit rating. They have been getting into the mortgage game, but it's a modicum of their portfolio. I don't think they're making it out of this year alive.\n\nWe're seeing a pattern here right? All of those images above - The sentiment across the market is clear: we're plumbing depths, and you almost can't fuck this up. Buy a put, make sure the strike price makes sense a little bit, and get. dat. cash.",

        "selftext": "The bottom (so far). Clearly, I fucked up pretty badly. I knew the playbook: don\u2019t sell during a panic. I did the one thing that I was certain I shouldn\u2019t have done. Consequently, I took a few days to take a step back and analyzed why I didn\u2019t follow the 1-step process of not opening your brokerage account. \n\nUp until March 23rd, I held Vanguard targeted date funds and DCA\u2019d. I wasn\u2019t worried that the world was going to end, and I genuinely believed we\u2019ll be back to full steam in 2-3 years. The reason I sold was because that was the point when I internalized that the fund was a mishmash of everything. Still, I was holding a bunch of companies and sectors that I believe would stagnate/collapse in the next 10-20 years. It just didn\u2019t sit right with me. Regardless of the countless evidence pointing towards indices being the best for investors, I just cannot reconcile with that fact. There will always be a voice in my head telling me to sell. I realized that the only way I could hold through crises is by actively choosing what was going to be in my portfolio. \n\nIs that a personal failure not following the data? Maybe. Can I beat the indices? Certainly not with day/swing trading. However, over a longer time frame, I think I have a good shot. \n\nI just wanted to share this with other people. This sub\u2019s version of loss porn if you will.  Fuck that was a lot of money.\n\nPS: one thing I wanted to address on the side. People often talk about how there are these huge teams of analysts from Ivy League schools with PhDs and what not, hence it is impossible to beat them. I disagree with that statement. I went to school with many of them - including the PhD part - and I\u2019ve worked with a few companies who have hired them for their services. They are far, far, far from infallible.",

Write your answers down, this isn't China, no bullshitting.\n\nTrump's estimation of 200,000 deaths with a peak in mid-April is almost certainly an underestimate. Information based on \"confirmed cases\" is a load of crap from both intentional and unintentional undertesting. There is however data that is relatively immune to fake news: deaths. The US is currently at 4,053 deaths. From this simple, clear data we can construct several hypotheses about how the illness will progress.\n\n**In this model, I will use three primary data inputs with low uncertainty to show you just how bad things are about to get.**\n\n1. The time series of US deaths. NB: I used that data available yesterday and have not added yesterday's 912 new deaths. Source: [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)\n2. A case fatality rate of 1%. This data comes from cruise ships where 100% of passengers were tested. This data is the best we have on case fatality, although the total numbers of infected are low enough to make this the largest source of model uncertainty. I also completely ignore the effect of overwhelmed hospitals in this analysis, if, as is likely, overwhelmed medical systems cause the case fatality rate to rise to WHO's 3.4%, things will be much worse. Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020\\_coronavirus\\_pandemic\\_on\\_cruise\\_ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_on_cruise_ships) \n3. A time delay of three weeks between infection and death. This delay is approximately consistent with a median 6 days to symptoms and 13 days from pneumonia confirmation to death. Sources: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus\\_disease\\_2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) and [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0320\\_article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0320_article) . It is also consistent with many of the individual case reports that I have read, example, infected on 1/14, dead on 2/07 [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html) . I also include a two week delay analysis to help understand model error.\n\nWith this simple data, we can easily reconstruct **how many Americans had the coronavirus three weeks prior**. We take the daily new death data, multiply it by 100 (since 1% died) and add it to the total infections of the day three weeks before.\n\n[Estimating prior infections](https://preview.redd.it/ecfxsfpjq8q41.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c69ab3bb304b26aa87440137d97e384738ecf37b)\n\nFrom this computation, we can see that the current US confirmed case number is of *177,000 is an underestimate by about one half of the total infections THREE WEEKS AGO*. This insight is the most important part of this post. We have way more cases right now than the vast majority realize. We're not going to be able to Korea our way out of this any time soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Estimating growth of infections and deaths**\n\nWithout massive intervention or a large proportion of the population infected we can use the growth in the number of deaths to estimate the growth rate of the infection. Below I fit an exponential curve to the growth of deaths to extract a parameter (lambda=3.54) for modeling future growth rate of the numbers of infected. I also included a fit for the last several days that possibly indicates a slight slowing of the growth rate. Note: All plots in this post are logarithmic.\n\n[Growth in number of deaths](https://preview.redd.it/u0dv1obas8q41.png?width=1551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2f421b200f4aa519f17f6ace25e0117de74d7a6)\n\nNow, we can use the that growth to extrapolate how many more people have been infected since the \\~314,000 on March 9th. Of course, that growth parameter has probably not remained constant. For that reason, I included some possible effects of social distancing whereby the growth halved or quartered starting on Monday, March 16th, when many business started suspending operations. I also assumed logistic growth so that the infection rate slows as more Americans are infected.\n\n[US infections, mid March through April](https://preview.redd.it/9gvfqjlav8q41.png?width=2249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4467a0e846a4e59bf15bc0952842cece4117a293)\n\nSo, to answer one of the initial questions: There are between 1 million and 100 million US cases at present. That's a huge range, but I am 95% sure that: **there are between 4 and 20 million US infections at present**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Estimating Deaths**\n\nIt gets ugly here. I know you're all bears, but I hope you're rooting for America and that we can pull a miracle. Lots of people will die.\n\nUsing the model for the number of infections, we can simply reverse the first process to find past number of infections to instead estimate the number of future deaths. Below, are estimates for total and daily deaths. The daily deaths will give us the best indication of which track we're on in the future. There's some discontinuity in that graph because I used the assumption that social distancing turned on all at once on 03/16, if we are on one of the lower tracks we will smooth into it in about a week's time. So yesterday's 912 deaths don't mean much yet as far as predicting the evolution of the disease.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[US Deaths, April through May](https://preview.redd.it/6mm2hvvsw8q41.png?width=2251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c31e0bad765c39169f6c243cca2a9684b1bd7aad)\n\nAs is clearly evident, there is no way we're only going to have 200,000 total deaths or a peak in two weeks unless social distancing is doing a much better job of quashing the spread than quartering it. Remember, this is also for 1% fatality rate, if deaths go up when hospitals are overwhelmed or because fat Americans die more, then there will be even more deaths. I am 80% sure that **we will have 1 million deaths minimum**. Hopefully, we sacrifice the economy a bit to save lives, but don't count on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Markets**\n\nThere's two main possibilities.\n\n1. Deaths peak between mid April and late May and that's when you should sell your puts because we are at peak fear.\n2. We do a good job of suppressing the spread, but we have to stay in quarantine for many months. The economy will be slowly burned and out and SPX goes (well) below 1800 in the late summer. June and later dated puts are going to do best here.",

The best thing for capital markets right now would be a massive plunge, as a market depression will necessarily be followed by a corresponding cyclical recovery. Common sense, fundamental analysis, and TA all indicate markets *should* go down right now as the emerging harm to the real economy is unprecedented and incalculable.\n\nWhats happening now is capital markets are rising even as the real, hard economy is crashing. Intervention by the Fed is literally derailing the markets off their 'natural' course and the consequences could be exponentially more disastrous than a 'regular' economic depression/recession.\n\nIf the S&amp;P returns to approaching ATH even as unemployment edges towards 30% or more, the contradictions in the system and the inequality of wealth will be truly unsustainable and will result in actual structural collapse exterior to the capital market bust/boom cycle. We could be in a situation where we simultaneously have an ATH market cap and a consumer liquidity crisis. Double digit unemployment accompanied by inflation instead of deflation. Contradictions which will be an economic nuclear bomb.\n\nThink rioting in the streets and coups around the world as the financial elite see their wealth unharmed, with the burden instead passed on to everyone else. Imagine what the subsequent history of the United States would have looked like if FDR's 'New Deal' floated the securities market instead of redistributing wealth into federal infrastructure projects and job growth.\n\nCapitalism as we know it will be destroyed by a small group of individuals who want to die with their own wealth intact. Fuck what might happen 5-10 years down the line as long as they can get out unscathed.\n\nTLDR; JPow and Trump are setting the US up to become the next Zimbabwe so big money can exit unscathed",

        "selftext": "Banks are being conservative which might suggest that all of this is \"priced in\".\n\nThey're borrowing like crazy with the Fed rate at 0.25% and they're using that capital to pay down old, higher interest liabilities i.e. collectively, they're handing it back to the Fed. None of that looks good or sounds good from a short-term perspective; and little of that QE will actually hit mainstreet -- at least in the period when it matters. But paying off debt is the only way out of this spiral -- especially when investors are scared (saving vs spending mentality), credit risk is poor, and economic growth is stifled. This is a deflationary spiral that could last 3-5 years; and QE can only mask the bleeding so much before it becomes detrimental to our future. Just look at Japan in the 90's. You can't fight lack of demand without meaningful control of the price lever.\n\nPoint being, the following realities are inevitable:\n\n* People will hoard the money supply\n* Lending will freeze despite a near-zero interest rate\n* Economic growth will be stifled as demand/investing remain low\n* Most of the money supply will be spent on commodities and debt obligations\n* New bubble will form when the real value of certain assets (housing etc.) gets distorted. This will also form the basis for our breakout\n\nThis is a [liquidity trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap). There will be a run on the market -- JPow has been printing to \"price\" all that in. For the past three weeks, the Fed has been acting as ballast to buy time for monetary policy to pivot. Now banks are in a strong cash position with foreknowledge of what to expect. So we should expect the floodgates to open and the carpet to finally get pulled. Stocks will crash again (hoarding cash), and harder; followed by a multi-year theta market marked by incremental inflation until we transition to a much needed growth period.\n\nWelcome to the **debt bubble**! FYI, whatever medicine we use to resolve this will ultimately form the cause of our next bubble. So on and so forth...\n\n* Globalization created cheap external labor which spurred economic investment/growth. This bubble created wage imbalance\n* Wage imbalance resulted in risky/unregulated/low interest lending which was a boon for big banks and consumer spending for nearly two decades. This bubble created debt\n* Debt caused the mortgage crisis of 2008 which resulted in a massive recession second only to the Great Depression. This bubble created QE\n* QE caused the liquidity trap of 2020 which resulted in a massive deflationary spiral akin to the recession. This bubble was created by excess and unnecessary money supply in a period of low demand\n* **Wage increase** will get us out of recession. But again, it will also form the cause of our next bubble\n\nCash out and pay down your debt. The environment looks exceptionally bearish for months and years to come. Everyone is scared to say liquidity trap because that will cause a cash run on banks. Hear me and prove them right.\n\n**EDIT**: I got banned for \"politicization\" on investing and the post can no longer be viewed, so I'm posting it here.

        "selftext": "TLDR; Read the bottom of the post\n\nYesterday, [I told you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyvnxt/what_happened_and_why_markets_seem_irrational/) about the events of the past few months and what it will mean for us in the near future. Well, since I had nothing better to do since we're all stuck in our houses for the next few months, I've decided to do another DD where we look back at the history of the stock market, 100-year trends, basic macro-economics, and how we could have SPY at 84 in the next few years.\n\n# A History of the Stock Market and the US Economy\n\n[DJI 1900 - 2020, log scale](https://preview.redd.it/ebvoys6w3as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b415f5f30739160a2e0e8fb855f7735dc2b02575)\n\nThe chart you see above is a log-scale graph of the Dow from 1900 to now. You\u2019ll notice that there\u2019s a long-term support line, which made contact in the depth of the Great Depression, and during the late 1970s. So what does this line represent?\n\nIn the short term, markets are pretty random and irrational. In the long term, stock prices usually reflect earnings, and thus stock indexes grow alongside the economy. The purple line you see here is the exponential growth of the economy\u2019s productivity (and inflation to a certain extent) since the 1900s in cycles of growth driven by technological innovation, with the expectation of growth accelerating the inflation of equity valuations, followed by a crisis changing the fundamentals of the economy, and finally stagnation.\n\n**Pre-1929 - Electrification**\n\nThe period of the beginning of the 1900s to 1930 saw the rise of electricity being used in industries and in households, along with mass production techniques. This led to the workforce being more efficient at making things, leading to an increase in earnings, GDP, and the stock market.\n\n**1930s to mid-1940s - Depression and War**\n\nWe all know what happened during these periods. The Great Depression, which eventually led World War II. What caused this? To this day, economists still argue about what exactly happened, but here\u2019s a simplified version of what most people can agree on.\n\nFirst, what causes a recession? Fundamentally, a recession happens when the supply and demand in the economy become mismatched. If you have a sudden decrease in a supply, we call this a supply shock. This usually happens with an important commodity that\u2019s important to the economy, like oil. We\u2019ll revisit this in the 1970s. A sudden increase in supply is also a supply shock and can also cause an economic decline, such as in Venezuela's case. But in the 1930s, this was a demand shock.\n\nThere was a decrease in demand after the roaring 20s due to the large amount of consumer debt that people took on to fund their new household appliances, like toasters. In other words, consumers and the economy overall was overleveraged. These debt cycles are a natural economic phenomenon, but the economic decline was exasperated by the Fed\u2019s poor decision making; they basically did the opposite of what they\u2019re doing right now. They raised interest rates in an attempt to preserve the dollar\u2019s value, and a liquidity crunch followed where everyone was trying to get their hands on dollars. This caused a deflationary spiral. Banks, with no actual backing from the Fed at this time, started having runs where customers demand to withdraw all their deposits. Since banks usually loan out most of their cash, many of them begin running out of cash and go under, causing more people to panic that they\u2019ll lose all of their deposits and causing more bank runs.\n\nThis depression eventually led to a decade of economic depression, followed by a devastating war that destroyed much of the world\u2019s economy and infrastructure - except for countries in the Americas.\n\n**Late-1940s to early 1970s - The post-war boom**\n\nThe golden age of capitalism. This time instead of it being driven by some new technology, it was a combination of increased global trade, Keynesian economics, and the fact that the US was one of the few countries that didn\u2019t have almost all productive capacity destroyed in WWII.\n\n**1970s - Stagflation**\n\nThis was a period of stagflation, with both high inflation and economic stagnation, and was caused by a supply shock. Specifically, OPEC decided to cut their supply of oil to the US because they didn\u2019t like their support of Israel. Higher oil prices mean higher prices to produce everything and less things being produced. The Fed meanwhile had no idea how to respond to this, since according to Keynesian theory, high inflation and high unemployment were impossible. When you have stagnation, you lower interest rates, but with inflation already rampant this makes a bad situation worse.\n\n**1980s - 2020 - The Information Age**\n\nThe most recent long-term economic boom is the result of improved efficiency from globalization, computers, and the internet. Except for a small blip in 2008 caused by some dumbasses on Wall Street thinking a diversified pool of mortgages to people with no income or assets deserve a AAA rating, the economy has been enjoying a period of consistent growth - but for how long?\n\n**2020 - 2030 - Stagnation?**\n\nThere\u2019s a good argument here that we\u2019re at the top of the long-term business cycle, and that the GDP growth in the recent years has not been from increased productivity but fueled by debt and low interest rates. Think about it - it's been over 10 years since the last recession. Yet, throughout this entire time, the Fed rate has been held to effectively 0 and the government has been maintaining a deficit like we\u2019re still in the 2008 recession.\n\n[Fed funds rate, 1960 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/05b1ain56as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=126897b35b6d72adce6abe047dc395699abb6732)\n\n[US govt. surplus \\/ deficit](https://preview.redd.it/ywmsfco66as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43cdfcb1d0dfdb820c9e5441b1505ce8c2a898b2)\n\nEven with all this stimulus going on, the GDP is struggling to even get to 3%. If we didn\u2019t have artificially low interest rates and high federal deficits masking the GDP growth numbers, we\u2019d be seeing the US economy slowly head towards yet another period of stagnation. In fact, there\u2019s another very large country that experienced this - Japan.\n\n# Japan - The Economy of the Future\n\n[Bank of Japan interest rates](https://preview.redd.it/v6qj5fhg6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84cdbd023744e6ff606543bceaba2369cc98b507)\n\n[Japanese Government surplus \\/ deficits](https://preview.redd.it/42za9ewh6as41.png?width=1410&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59f22284c6e2e8292d08ea66f8cc77cad7ed940a)\n\nAfter nearly two decades of low interest rates and budget deficits, Japan can barely get their real GDP growth above 2%.\n\n[Japan GDP](https://preview.redd.it/73v8b9sp6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b54891a9f59801599f0086b8f799bbdc463682ff)\n\nLet\u2019s look at how the Japanese stock market is doing during this time.\n\n[Nikkei 225, 1980 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/h0gtdxhr6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9f4b878d85a18eebc01575a21904c5a03b34a25)\n\nWhat you\u2019re seeing here is the Nikkei 225 growing to its peak in 1990, crashing, and then never recovering to its previous highs. The Lost Score (20 years). But why didn\u2019t it ever recover? Don\u2019t stonks and the economy only go up in the long run?\n\nIn the late 1980s, Japan experienced an asset bubble fueled by **uncontrolled money supply and credit expansion**, overheating the asset market. They started to even start to buy corporate bonds in 2009 and buy stocks in 2010 out of desperation. Huh, this sounds pretty similar to what the Fed is doing right now.\n\n[Japanese Yen Inflation Rate](https://preview.redd.it/oftsdxex6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfd500c5f8ac4395f4506a0933361767a233dca7)\n\nWhy did they do this? Because they were so reckless in their monetary easing policies that when the asset bubble popped and people stopped spending as much money due to the wealth effect. The Bank of Japan couldn\u2019t do anything to get people to spend money again, having already overheated their markets, and Japan went to two decades of deflation. They\u2019ve caused a **liquidity trap**.\n\nThe Bank of Japan and Japanese government has done everything to try to keep their GDP growing despite nothing actually driving it. Any productivity gains they would have gotten from the adoption of information technology was overshadowed by the decline of their automotive and electronics industries as they became less competitive with the rise of the Asian Tigers, and eventually China.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes. We\u2019ve seen that the US economy go into economic stagnation in the past, and modern economies are still in economic stagnation, with nothing except for unsustainable central bank money printing and government debt driving GDP growth. We\u2019ve also seen stock prices rise to new highs, despite nothing fundamentally changing in the real economy justifying the productivity growth across every industry. Low interest rates have also made stock buybacks the norm, with some companies like $PLAY levering themselves to buy back $630M of its own shares in 2019. Their market cap on Jan 1 2020 was around $1.2B. Are we in an asset bubble?\n\n# The Stock Market Bubble\n\nWell, what is an asset bubble? It\u2019s when asset prices surge beyond what the fundamentals of them warrant it. It\u2019s when investors become irrational in their valuation, and assume that the price of an asset will continue to go up in the future with no fundamental reasons justifying why it will other than that\u2019s what happened in the past. People on r/investing start telling people that they should \u201cDollar Cost Average\u201d into the markets when they go down because stocks will go back to new ATHs in a few years.\n\nEven with the argument that stocks will rebound in the near term to new ATHs because that\u2019s what happened in the past, this is only true if you don\u2019t look at data past 50 years ago and you pretend the US stock exchanges are the only ones in the world. Look at what happened in the 1970s. The Dow didn\u2019t make new significant highs in between 1966 and 1982. That\u2019s 16 years. If you account for the high inflation going on at this time, you would have been slowly losing money in real terms. Even more recently, look at the stock market in Japan. 30 years later and the Nikkei 225 still hasn\u2019t recovered to its previous highs. Imaging DCA-ing into that decline. Meanwhile in Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 hasn\u2019t come anywhere close to their 2000 highs from 20 years ago. The idea that the stock market will fundamentally always go up in a time span of a decade, which is the mainstream belief touted by every financial advisor and finance gurus is flawed; history and almost every major country\u2019s stock markets show this.\n\n[Euro Stoxx 50, 1990 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/yupt7ozt7as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0837c4aff8dd7eb088d28647547d7e7d72d2bcc5)\n\nHow can we tell if we\u2019re in a bubble? Let\u2019s look at the fundamentals of stocks, and what should be driving the true valuation of them - Earnings.\n\n[S&amp;P500 Shiller PE ratio](https://preview.redd.it/gobstuyy7as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96143d6870fdb9c02293bcb6f29a7c069f36a6ec)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know if you\u2019re in a bubble until it bursts.\n\n**The Bottom**\n\nThe US economy is being driven by debt and consumer confidence. What happens when a black swan event happens that causes a supply shock by locking down supply chains, a demand shock by not allowing the service economy to operate, and another supply shock in the opposite direction happens in oil, because OPEC? Uncertainty and consumer confidence and spending to go down. After a decade of easy money, it might be hard for the Fed to do anything to restart consumer confidence, even years after COVID-19 is eradicated.\n\nLet\u2019s look back at the long term resistance in the Dow. If we do go into a decade-long deflationary spiral like Japan, we might be on our way to making contact with it, but it will be a slow, multi-year decline. If it takes 3 years to reach the 100-year trend, that will be the DJI declining to 10000 by 2023. That looks bad right? Let\u2019s calculate what a bottom would look like using another method. During the last two periods of long-term stagnation (1930s and 1970s), we saw the Shiller PE ratio of the S&amp;P500 drop down to 8 at the lowest levels. Today it is at 26. Even with pre-lockdown earnings, when the economy was in \u201cgreat shape\u201d, with low unemployment and high consumer confidence, this would represent a 70% decline in stock valuations, leaving us with the Dow at 7000 and S&amp;P500 at 840. Even going to the historic mean of 17, we should be seeing at least a 35% decline with the Dow at 15400 and S&amp;P500 at 1800.\n\nIn other words, as stock valuations cool down toward normal levels, we\u2019re likely going to see the Dow go to somewhere between 7000 and 15400, and the S&amp;P500 go somewhere between 1800 and 840 in the next few years.\n\n[\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bhat](https://preview.redd.it/qafgn26m8as41.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7227447a2f129e6871e73832472e75b1880ba032)\n\nTLDR; Read the title\n\nEDIT - Turns out you can't buy 2025 puts in Robinhood, so SPY 12/16/2022 175p\n\nInteresting video that goes a bit more in depth about the debt-driven growth of the US economy and stock market, and the liquidity trap its in - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loj0z43VZ7I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loj0z43VZ7I)\n\nEDIT2 - u/fancykevin00 brought up an interesting graphic showing the trend with the Fed increasing their balance sheet (QE) and what happened in the stock market during that time - [https://i.imgur.com/3NLR9rx.png](https://i.imgur.com/3NLR9rx.png)",

        "selftext": "So I had several accounts in Jtek's WSB discord server, which I signed up with throwaway emails unique in my domain. Guess what. They all just got spammed with [this](https://i.imgur.com/tl1dcWI.png). Note: that email was only used for a discord account that only joined the old server and did nothing else.\n\nHow did they collect these emails? The discord invite link that used to be on the sidebar asked permission to authorize a discord app to have access to your discord email, before redirecting you to the actual invite link. That way he harvest all of your emails. Check your \"Authorized apps\" in your discord account. [This is what you should see if you joined the server after the sidebar link was changed](https://i.imgur.com/4xNcJz5.png). It's likely if that's the case, you also got the spam email.\n\nI've been asked by mods to not point any fingers, but let's just say it was very likely a former mod.\n\nThe fucker completely sold us out, and is milking it as hard as he can.\n\n**Edit 1:** If you live in California, [CCPA](https://www.smartrmail.com/blog/ccpa-email-marketing/) might apply to you. In Europe, GDPR might too. He also violated Discord's [terms of service](https://discordapp.com/terms) since it prohibits \"attempt to obtain passwords or other private information from other members;\" by harvesting emails and IPs.\n\n**Edit 2:** According to Cam, he had no idea that the email list was obtained illegitimately, please do not direct any hate towards him. While he did make the mistake of accepting a random email list without making sure the emails listed were interested, the person who sold him the email list is who we should care the most about right now. Cam said a discord account (now deleted) approached him about this. [Here is what he told me](https://i.imgur.com/qSiQ6jI.png). And [here](https://i.imgur.com/QOC7IZ4.png) is his statement in his Discord.\n\n**Edit 3:** This thread is getting so popular I should write a book about it to make money off of autists :\\^)\n\n**Edit 4:** Cam also said he got the email list \"a couple of weeks ago or like two weeks ago, hard to remember, I get 100s of messages a day\". ~~So it's likely the former mod started selling us out before he got banned.~~ Nope, check edit 7 later on.\n\n**Edit 5:** Holy shit. [Check this out](https://imgur.com/a/owgqjvB), a conversation between 2 mods from Jtek's server, one of them sent me that.\n\nThe mod who sent me that screenshot said then:\n\n&gt; Now the guy who does tech support for the discord is claiming the VM that the bot that collected our info on was hacked.\n&gt;\n&gt;But still, they harvested our info through shady means.\n\nBut was it really hacked, or is that the excuse they're coming up with?\n\n**CHANGE YOUR DISCORD PASSWORD.

Initially they collected usernames and passwords\n2. Eventually they changed the method to just link their app to your discord account and collected your email and IP\n\n**Edit 6:** Thank you all for the support guys. I'm now announcing my very own [WSB championship](https://wsb.gg/championship). Please sign up now as spots are limited. More details to be announced soon.\n\n**Edit 7:** [I found a guy who was creating daily accounts and joining that Discord server because he kept getting banned daily, so we discovered the email list includes all emails up until April 8th (maybe 9th).](https://i.imgur.com/c602xix.png) **Which means he started selling these emails immediately after he got banned.** Not before.\n\n**Edit 8:** [Here](https://imgur.com/a/80WLtNG) are the conversations they had back then about this. They *knew*. Also, it's possible they never collected passwords, but only usernames and emails. That's if they always used that method. It's still unconfirmed.\n\n**Edit 9:** Jartek and other admins started to remove mods from the server to try to curb the leaks. Most mods have turned against them already and saved every bit of incriminating evidence. I'm collecting them and publishing them here whenever we find something juicy.\n\n**Edit 10:** [I'd like to announce my new book](https://i.imgur.com/3QDbY4h.png). And with that, I'm out of ideas on how to make money off of you guys. Does anyone know someone who can give me some fresh new ideas? Perhaps someone experienced in this area?",

        "selftext": "I don't think this is a normal recession-recovery situation. It's not a business event. It's a completely artificial event. That means that looking at how this is going to unfold in terms of past recessions \u2014 and particularly a lot of people are going back to the Great Recession about a decade ago \u2014 is probably not going to provide much in the way of useful guidance, at least that's my opinion.\n\nThe worst weeks for unemployment in U.S. history were recorded over the past three weeks: 3.3 million were reported on March 21, 6.9 million on March 28 and 6.6 million on April 4. Before the pandemic, the previous worst unemployment week was recorded in October 1982 when 695,000 people filed jobless claims.\n\nI wanted to share some insights / stats with you and get your opinions.\n\nThe best-case scenario for the COVID crisis is a V-shaped recession. If this happens, the economy will rebound as quickly as it has declined, with minimal long-lasting financial damage. A sharp downturn followed by a quick rebound in growth defines the V-shaped recession. For the COVID-19 recession to be V-shaped, we would need to set up enough coronavirus testing so that people could safely go back to work without creating another surge in cases, and effectively treat existing cases. Around 38% of companies believe that the recovery will be V-shaped, with the economy rebounding by the third quarter of 2020, according to a survey from EY.\n\nIf COVID-19 causes a longer, U-shaped recovery, that could mean the economy wouldn\u2019t begin recovering until the end of 2020 or even early 2021. EY found that 54% of companies believe that a U-shaped recession is likely. \n\nThose arguing for the V-shaped recovery are making two wildly unrealistic assumptions. One, we re-open the economy pretty much all at once, and two, consumers won\u2019t change their behaviors. For example, they start going back to bars and baseball games immediately.\n\nI just sold most of my indices and am thinking about shorting S&amp;P500. The recent rise in the equity indices appears based more on FOMO than on medical developments for dealing with the pandemic. I suspect markets will test previous lows set in March, similar to 2008-2009. \n\nWhat do you think about an upcoming recession, and about the steps needed for a economic recovery?",

        "selftext": "Mortgage Servicing Crisis - Chapter 2 - Forbearances\n\nI submitted a post last week summarizing some issues in the mortgage industry. It was a long article from Barry Habib with some insight/conclusions. I'm writing this to add to that post with some additional info about what's going on in the industry and how the forbearances are impacting mortgage servicing.  \n\nThe two big points from the previous post that I'll touch upon:\nMargin Calls - the Fed buying mortgage-backed-securities (MBS) was causing lenders to run into significant margin calls, a fairly significant risk to lenders. Lenders hedge their locked loan pipelines against market fluctuations. \n\nForbearance Poses Risk to Lenders - The CARES Act, Section 4022, provides that a mortgage servicer must provide borrowers a forbearance of up to an initial 180 days, and then it can be renewed for a subsequent 180 days. During this period, the servicers are expected to keep making payments to the asset owner - Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac / Ginnie Mae (the government sponsored enterprises, or GSEs). So, even if providing the borrower the loan forbearance required by the CARES Act, a servicer is sending payments to the GSEs. As I'll discuss below, the Act does not identify specific methods to resolve the forbearance at the end of the period. \n\nSo, whats new?\nWell, the margin call is still an issue - but the fed backed off of their level of MBS purchasing by a little bit, but not enough to resolve the issue. Lenders clearing out their active loans will help resolve this, so in time it will improve as long as the Fed continues to be timid on MBS purchase. It will still hurt lenders but I don't think this is going to be a nail in the coffin for any of the big servicers. \n\nThe forbearance process is worth further describing. So, hypothetical situation: lets say I have a mortgage serviced by Quicken (don't get excited they are private) and I just heard the CARES Act allows me to skip payments. I'm a waiter, I just got laid off, I could really use 3 months without my $2k mortgage payments. I call them, wait on hold for two hours, and then they agree to let me not make payments for the next three months - and they will send the info to sign. Great, right? Almost too good to be true. \n\nSo, here are the three outcomes of a forberance after Quicken quickly agrees to it:\n\n1.) BY DEFAULT -  From the borrower's perspective, I don't hear anything for three months. Then, in month 4, Quicken calls and says I have 4 payments, three of which are \"delinquent.\" I now learn there are 4 payments - all due in month 4. Well, hold on I just returned to work I don't have $8k - what can I do besides YOLO FDs? Well, probably not much. \n\n\n2.) Payment Plan - the next option is to resolve that past due $6k on a payment plan, if the lender agrees to this. So instead of a $2k payment, I might have a $2500 payment for a year. Now I just returned to my service industry job - I was already paycheck to paycheck, I have all sorts of other past due credit card/auto/student loan bills from being laid off, and now my mortgage is 25% higher. That's not going to work for me.\n\n\n3.) Loan Modification - A loan modification is the option that everyone thinks they are getting through CARES Act by default - it extends the term of the mortgage and adds the missed payments to the end. This is not a scenario that will be provided over the phone as an immediate solution if I call Quicken and ask. It has to be applied for, I would have to qualify, and it has to be approved by the lender. It is not a trivial request, and it will not be approved lightly given the current lending environment and amount of credit risk. Plus, considering the lender has already made 3+ payments to the GSEs without one from me - they are going to want to quickly determine whether this is going to be a performing loan or a non-performing loan (more to come on this). They will want to flush out the good loans from the bad as soon as they can get past the time periods required in the CARES Act. \n\nSo, a loan modification requires a level of qualification (credit check, paystubs, etc.). As a borrower, I am then going to have to show this lender the amount of debt I've racked up paying for everything with credit cards while laid off - and how fucked my credit has gotten not paying any bills while waiting for my $1200 Starbucks allowance from the Feds.\n\nI am a Loan Officer, as mentioned in the previous post. Half my week has been talking to past clients about forbearanaces, and most of them just want a few months of skipped payments so they can relax about the economy and have that safety net. Sure, some have lost their jobs or are on the verge of losing their jobs - in which case it makes sense, your alternative is worse. One owns three rentals I've financed and 0/3 renters can pay their rent this month. \n\nSO MANY PEOPLE are requesting the forbearance on an elective basis that our industry experts are begging real estate professionals to properly describe to them how this works, and what they will be faced with. Servicers are quick to approve the forbearance, and the borrowers are not understanding the possible outcomes. \n\nI have a friend I consider to be a business-minded, prudent, and intelligent individual. He called servicers for two properties, US Bank and Wells Fargo - one offered a forbearance of 3 months and the other offered 6 months. He took them, they said they'd send something for him to sign but that it was in effect. Neither made any effort whatsoever to explain to him the resulting options at the end of the forbearance. He called me to ask if it would have any adverse impact, as they had not described the process well to him. \n\nThese are call centers taking the requests, obviously they are doing what they can to get to the next call.  \n\nMy company has a $110B servicing portfolio, and we got 8000 requests for forbearances IN A WEEK. Mr. Cooper (subject of my last post) has a $640B servicing portfolio. \n\nAt the end of this initial 3-6 month forbearance that lenders are required to offer, we are going to see lenders quickly decide how to handle each file. As mentioned above, they consider the account delinquent during the forbearance (although not reported to credit) - so they already have a jump on the next steps to collect past-due payments. There will likely be a flood of \"performing\" loans (paid on time) turning into \"non-performing loans\" (past-due 180+ days). If a loan becomes non-performing, the GSEs end up auctioning off the assets (mortgage notes) in blocks. These blocks are generally bought at auction by funds and securitized into non-performing loan MBSs. Of the companies that do this, there are only a few that have publicly traded entities. \n\nNow, I'll touch briefly on what is going on with mortgage lending - because a lot of the servicers like Quicken have revenue split between originating and servicing:\nPurchase Volume - The last two weeks we saw purchase mortgage applications decline 15% and 11%. Personally, I have had a noticeable reduction in purchase apps, and all of my preapproved borrowers are putting their home search on hold.\nRefinance Volume - Because of current credit risk lenders are considering, rates are only attractive on an owner-occupied primary residence with an optimal borrower. Low credit score, investment properties, etc., have rates so high they don't make sense. \nGeneral Volume - Loan programs have tightened up considerably in the last two weeks. Yesterday my company scrapped all of our jumbo programs. We had already scrapped all of our non-QM programs (subprime). Our FICO requirements are up 40 points, for self-employed individuals we can only use 75% of their income now, use of gift funds is more restrictive, etc. We are definitely going to see less individuals qualifying for financing because of these guideline adjustments. \n\nTL;DR folks can start here with only knowing \"non-bank mortgage lenders in trouble\"\n\nHow to use this info:\n1.) Puts on non-bank mortgage lenders - They are going to suffer because all of their revenue comes from originating and the residual from servicing. They are going to lose the servicing revenue on a significant amount of non-performing loans, and they are going to have trouble originating loans for at least a few months. My last post included COOP, the largest publicly traded servicer - they also originate. I still like it and expect the underlying share price to continue to decline, but the premiums are outrageous right now. I like puts on any non-bank publicly traded mortgage originating/servicing company. Not 100% in line with this recommendation, but I decided to make a move on REM which is a closed-end mortgage-based REIT. It has 80% in residential mortgage securities and 20% commercial (which I also think is vulnerable). \nSo, REM 15p 10/16\n\n2.) I spent a long time last night reading the auction results from non-performing loans and then looking up the buyers to see which publicly traded companies might mostly focus on NPLs. I wanted to buy calls on companies that focus on NPLs, anticipating they would have a higher volume in coming months. Most are either private, or they securitize the loans and aren't exposed, or they are too diversified in other aspects of real estate to anticipate the NPL volume helping share price. I don't have a great play here. If someone wants a fun research project, go try to find a company who services NPLs, is publicly traded, and is not well-diversified. Although I did not find them buying recent auction pools (I only looked at '19) I did take a position in [an option with an underlying value too low for this post to get approved] because they focus on NPLs and at an auction long ago they received 90% of the NPLs being offered by the GSEs. The premiums were cheap and their share price is 30% of what it was in February. \n\nThere are some banks with significant mortgage servicing rights, but I think the Feds are more likely to let the non-bank lenders fail. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions on positions to take based on this info, please do comment with it. I know we had some MBS guys and other people in the mortgage industry comment on the last post, would be interested for more input. \n\nTL:DR : Fed says you don't have to pay your mortgage, lenders agree quickly to forbearances, borrowers will be expected to pay in full at the end of the period - but they aren't understanding that, on a large scale. \nCOOP 5p 10/16 (but maybe wait for a bounce the premiums are nuts)\nREM 15p 10/16",

        "selftext": "After my last post, I had multiple people asking if I could take a deeper look into the renewable energy industry. Since I\u2019m also very interested and I feel it will become a very important sector, I took the time to review it. First of all, let me explain why investing now is a good time. \n\nWhen you look at manufacturers, the biggest market cap is not even $5 billion. There is so much room for growth and there\u2019s also a lot of competition. When you can point your finger at the best company, it might be the homerun for your portfolio in 10-15 years. Even if you don\u2019t hit the right one, it\u2019s still gonna be ok since the industry is only growing. To be clear, I only looked at manufacturers, not distributors. You won\u2019t see any companies like NEE, DUK, BEP, etc. \n\nSecondly, you all know Trump doesn\u2019t believe in environmentally issues, renewable energy and that sort of stuff. With elections coming up, investments might stay the same or they might go up drastically when the democrats win. Either way, the sector will continue to grow and you can\u2019t really go bad with investing in it. \n\nLast argument, I feel like a lot of people don\u2019t know the importance of solar energy yet. It goes beyond the industry, as it gets implemented more and more by other industries. It\u2019s already a big item for giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon,\u2026 to keep their cloud servers running for example. \n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nIn this post, I will focus on solar energy the most, as it is the biggest and most important part of renewable energy. Based on market cap from the solar industry, we have 3 leaders and 7 others on a significant distance, but still able to get to the top for the next 5-10 years. From that top 10, RUN, SPWR and VSLR fall off based on financials.  \n\n**ENPH**  \nMarket leader on micro-inverters (the things that convert solar charge into electricity). Even their inverters get used by big competitors like SPWR. Investing more and more into energy storage. It\u2019s focussing on the private market, which might be a short term problem, but their inverters are definitely their big win. Not only do they receive revenue from their own installations, but they have other companies using their products as well when installing other products, making ENPH techniques present in an enormous amount of solar installations. The financials are great, they have a decent amount of cash to get investing and they\u2019re only profitable since last year, giving them a lot of room to grow. They\u2019re bound to get number one position in solar tech and they didn\u2019t even launch their best technology yet. \n\n**SEDG**  \nGreat financials as well. Assets over double amount of liabilities, almost no long term debt and enough cash to get growing. Very big growth on revenue. They were planning to even double their production in 2020 and release some new products, but that\u2019s gonna be delayed a bit. They are working with TSLA on batteries and charging stations. It all looks very positive, although I have to point out some people are calling SEDG \u2018yesterday\u2019s solution\u2019. It might be up and keep growing a lot, but if you want the best 10 year investment, you should stick with ENPH. \n\n**FSLR**  \nVery inconsistent income, but a great balance sheet. Assets 3 times liabilities and loads of cash to get investing into the future. Their profit margins are pretty small though, in comparison to the industry. FSLR is the only company that works with utility companies to provide energy. To draw you a simple picture: if you get electric energy at home, it\u2019s been delivered by utility companies and the energy itself is mostly created by FSLR. Over the past few years, utilities are losing market share because people are buying and setting up their own energy installations at home. Therefore utilities, and by extension FSLR, are losing market share. Because of the crisis, people will be less likely to install their own installations as unemployment numbers are rising. FSLR could be the better short term bet, but it\u2019s hard to predict when it will turn around again and they will definitely lose long term. \n\n**JKS**  \nVery innovative techniques, one of the most efficient solar panels on the market. Therefore gaining a lot of advantage on their competitors, or \u2018moat\u2019 by Warren Buffett terms. If you feel like solar panels are the most important part of the industry, I would definitely suggest looking into JinkoSolar. They have a lot of cash to get investing, low on long term debt and I see them coming the closest to top 3 in the future.\n\n**CSIQ**  \nLooking for value, then this is the one. PEG ratio of only 0.19, the industrial average is 0.68. Have to point out as well that their growth rate isn\u2019t that great and you might wait a long long time to get the gains going on this one. They also have a lawsuit running against them, claiming to steal Solaria\u2019s patented module technology. \n\n**NOVA**  \nThey might get hit hard by covid-19. Sunnova is a pretty young company, full on investing and expanding, thus having low cash reserves. They might need to be backed by bailout money, putting them even further behind the top 5 solar companies. When they get back in 1-2 years, I feel like the other companies will have too much of a head start. \n\n**AZRE**  \nThey have experienced almost no impact from covid-19 as an Indian based company. Their projects have not been impacted and the plants are running full force. However there has been significant reduction in demand and they\u2019ve been seeing delayed payments from customers. It operates like First Solar, selling energy to government utilities. Big profit margins as well, so they might get out of this crisis easily. That\u2019s also the main reason why the stock didn\u2019t drop that much. Growth will be limited, but a stable investment. \n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nNext, I\u2019m gonna mention some other renewable energy resources. I took one of the best companies per industry as an example, but I\u2019m not gonna go through those resources more deeply as I don\u2019t believe in them.\n\n**VWDRY**  \nThe wind energy industry is more inconsistent than solar energy, therefore not the most favorable kind of resource to invest in. It also doesn\u2019t have real potential to expand to private use, but whoever wants to invest in it, I suggest VWDRY. It is the biggest company in the world in terms of wind power. Apart from having the most and biggest wind farms, they also offer their maintenance and knowledge to help optimizing other wind farm locations. Vestas also just signed a great contract with a Danish energy company for delivery in the upcoming next years. They have a lot of cash ready to invest and they also have decent value, so you can\u2019t really go wrong with them.\n\n**REGI**  \nREGI produces and sells biofuels and renewable chemicals. It produces biomass-based diesel, using corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat amongst other things. The company might be in bad weather, as they are low on cash. They are operating in an investment needing industry, so it\u2019s definitely not the right moment for a financial crisis like this.\n\nAs you can see, I didn\u2019t include nuclear energy companies. Nuclear energy is a green energy solution and definitely isn\u2019t bad. However it\u2019s not growing like solar and wind because it has a lot of negative feedback and image. There is more waste, it\u2019s more expensive and therefore also less investments. It\u2019s easy math, the more volume, the lower price. No one is investing in nuclear, so pricing can\u2019t compete with other resources. \n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nFor me, this research was surprising. I was expecting to find more small companies with breaking innovative techniques, but it seems like the ones at the top are predicted to stay there and increase distance. If anyone has some valuable information on small companies, definitely share them in this thread.\n\nTo conclude, ENPH and SEDG are without a doubt the best investments right now. Depending on your timeline, you might want to sell SEDG in 5-10 years, while keeping ENPH for a lifetime. JKS is the higher risk, higher reward kinda bet here, with still decent coverage of risk.\n\nThere are of course way more other renewable energy resources, but I don\u2019t know enough about them. If I would start researching them, I might be working like a professional broker/investor and I decided that I\u2019ve put enough energy into stock research the past weeks. Right now, I\u2019m gonna enjoy the weather, work a bit in the garden and passively buy some shares this week with all that info I\u2019ve gathered over the past few months.",

        "selftext": "In a nutshell, we  have a huge global oil supply glut because everything is on lock down  (mainly China).  \n \n\nOil prices have cratered from $70/brl in Jan to $22/brl right now. Saudi  Arabia can survive on this. Russia can go broke slow on this. American  shale dies at this level. So SA &amp; Russia are playing a little footsy  to keep prices down and bankrupt the American shale patches, even  though they absolutely hate each other. But they want that China market  share. Trump knows this and has been doing everything he can to broker a  deal to cut production to get oil prices up. Why? Becuz - our energy  sector in the US (especially the oil sector) is leveraged up their ass  with debt. So much debt, living paycheck to paycheck with bank loans.  Banks are ready to take possession of the smaller companies already kind  of debt. You think we've seen a stock market slide? Companies like  Chesapeake and Marathon are probably goners. If that goes up the food  chain to COP or XOM, and they default? (They aren't in the stimulus  package btw, so that would require even more bailout) This stock market  goes tits the \\*\\*\\*\\* up and 45 can kiss 2020 election good bye. SO. OPEC+  and Russia got together with a bunch of other oil countries (Not the US,  because we have antitrust laws and don't play the monopoly price game)  and agreed to a massive oil production cut to try to stabilize oil  prices. Everyone played nice except Mexico. You probably think Mexico  doesn't matter in this game. But they do. They wanted Mexico to take a  400,000 barrel a day cut as part of the whole 10M/brl a day cut that the  whole group wants to accomplish. Problem. Mexico is hedged up the ass  against oil price crashes (they're like the only one) and said go \\*\\*\\*\\*  yourselves. We're printing money and we like that. So they said, we'll  do 100,000 brls/day cause we want to play ball and there's a global  pandemic. SA said \\*\\*\\*\\* you, no deal. So Trump jumps in and says, the US  will make up the 300,000 barrels a day that Mexico won't so can we have  deal plz? SA says \\*\\*\\*\\* you. Why? Because we have never told oil  producers how much they can drill for or not drill for becuz capitalism.  We produce enough oil to have a seat at the oil table with OPEC and  Russia, but we don't play those games. So, the question is - does the  federal government mandate our private oil companies cut production to  make up for Mexico's share to get the deal done? Easy yes, right?  Stabilize prices, everyone wins, right? Except - remember, all these  companies are leveraged like crazy and at these prices if they can't  produce fast enough, they get repoed. So they have to keep selling oil  or they die.   \n \n\nTLDR - Trump needs this deal so the market doesn't go tits up and he can  get re-elected. If we do the deal, capitalism takes another hit and  small oil producers get \\*\\*\\*\\*ed.\n\nUps/Downs: These fucks never find a way to deal and they don't want to. Oil goes to 15 and the shale patch goes tits up. Banks repo. Market crashes. Look, I know we are obsessed with the coronas. I think this is where the real battle is. When US oil goes under. And it will. That's what takes the rest of the house of cards with it.",

But in China, jobless indicators are released on a monthly or even quarterly basis, and cover only part of the workforce.\n\n&gt; The most widely cited figure, the surveyed urban unemployment rate issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), jumped to an all-time high\nof 6.2 per cent in January and February combined, up from 5.2 per cent in December. This roughly equated to an additional 5 million people thrown out of work.\n\n&gt; Another government metric, the urban registered jobless rate, is published quarterly and measures only the urban residents willing to file tedious reams of paperwork to register as being unemployed. This indicator has been stable at a rate of around 4 per cent for years, with few fluctuations over economic cycles.\n\n&gt; Due to the lack of official data covering China\u2019s entire workforce, economists and analysts have started to rely on private surveys, online job listings, anecdotal reports and even indicators such as subway rides in major cities to get a clearer view of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the unemployment situation in China.\n\n&gt; Beijing\u2019s challenge\nis particularly severe given the lack of an adequate social safety net in China.\n\n&gt; Unemployment benefits are small and reserved for only a few \u2013 a maximum of 2.5 million people claimed unemployment benefits in each quarter over the past decade, in a country of almost 1.4 billion.\n\n&gt; \u201cRural migrant workers who lost their paid work are generally not included in government data,\u201d Lu said. \u201cMany of them may find it hard to maintain their previous living standards. Many migrant workers will have to go back to their farmland to support a basic lifestyle.\u201d\n\nTL;DR: China is under reporting unemployment data and unemployed people don't really have a social safety net.",

        "selftext": "So.. After seeing u/chronicklez's post yesterday - I was disappointed to learn that the guy withdrew the last $30 from his account... which I believe was enough, with the right trades, to get get back to even and beyond!  What kind of sick fuck loses all that money, then withdraws the last 30?!  If he needed it for toilet paper, then I'm sorry,  I apologize... \n\nAnyways, I made an additional Robinhood account with my wife's info and deposited $30.  I am going to grind my way up to 144K in the memory of u/chronicklez's account - When I get there, I will give him 5K so he can attempt to get back to even.  If I fail, then I fail - but at least I tried... \n\nI will spend today searching for the right trade... maybe its out there maybe its not... Part of me wants to make it a call on CLX because of what daddy pump said yesterday... but I don't know how i feel about blood money... Don't inject bleach... or stick UV lights up your ass to kill the virus (if you wanna do it for kicks, go for it, maybe your wife's bf will assist, I know mine would love to)... Anyways, when I find the trade, I will post it here, then we will go from there, and hopefully we will get back to 144k together - as one nation under Shkreli... and we will get through this fucking nightmare of a reality that most of us are living and come out the other side stronger and richer and happier... or we won't and none of us will make it out alive and we will all die miserable deaths on ventilators alone in our own arms... but in the meantime... lets get that bread.\n\nLove,\n\nSilk\n\n![img](infdqitgtru41)",

        "selftext": "Alright, listen up autists. I'm going to give you the play of a lifetime here: Eurodollar puts\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, if you only have a RH account, don't bother wasting your time reading this, you can't trade eurodollars on RH. Any other serious broker should work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Quick intro\n\nIf you don't know what Eurodollars are, look it up first, eg. the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodollar) page to get an ELI5. The main thing to understand is that Eurodollars have little to do with euros or exchange rates, and everything to do with INTEREST rates, specifically the 3-month USD LIBOR rate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe futures contracts are priced on a 0-100 scale (mostly, could go over 100 with negative rates for example), with the price being 100 - LIBOR3M. So, if LIBOR is say 1%, price of the futures contract would be 100-1 = 99. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# THE PLAY: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe current LIBOR3M rate is 1.21888% (see [this page](https://www.global-rates.com/interest-rates/libor/american-dollar/usd-libor-interest-rate-3-months.aspx) for the current rates) as of April 09. That would imply a Eurodollar settlement at 98.78112. However, the pricing on the May front-month options /GEM0 is at 99.485, which implies a rate of 0.515% for the LIBOR in May. **NOT GONNA HAPPEN!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what you want to buy are the May 15 puts on the June 2020 futures. Unlike regular stonk options, Eurodollar FOPs come in **2500x multipliers**. The price on the May 15 99p is $0.0050, which means 1 contract will cost you $12.5 + commisions, so $1000 will buy you about 80 contracts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How much can you make you ask?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, if the LIBOR3M remains flat at 1.21888%, you'll make (99 - (100 - 1.21888)) \\* 2500 \\* NUM\\_CONTRACTS. So, for $1000 = 80 contracts = $43,776\n\nIf the LIBOR moves back to last week's high, 1.45%, you'll make $90,000 per $1k. \n\nAnd if the LIBOR moves to over 2%, like I expect it to, you'll make $200,000 or more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beauty in this play is that it works for bulls and bears alike. If you're bearish =&gt; shit's fucked =&gt; LIBOR loans become more risky =&gt; higher LIBOR. If you're bullish &amp; everything goes back to ATH =&gt; higher LIBOR, either through inflationary expectations or higher rate expectations. If you think everything gonna stay flat, you still make 43x.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember that this is not investment advice and you should do your own DD before following some retard on the internet. That said, I'm willing to answer whatever questions you guys have, just post a comment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy Eurodollar (ticker /GE) May 15 / June puts at either 99 for $0.0050 or 98.875 for $0.0025.",

        "selftext": "Being an aviation nerd, I noticed something strange on my flight tracker app. Fiji Airways is operating a nonstop flight from Nadi to Salt Lake City, a route they don't normally operate. Strange. Further investigation showed another odd flight, this time a LATAM 767 coming in from South America into SLC. My initial thought was that these planes were being shipped to America for long term storage because there was NO possible way that sudden demand between Nadi and Salt Lake City warranted a nonstop flight.\n\nBut then I found this article: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/31/mormon-church-is-chartering-jets-bring-thousands-missionaries-home/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/31/mormon-church-is-chartering-jets-bring-thousands-missionaries-home/) (press the X in your browser as soon as loading is complete to avoid ad block popup)\n\nThe Mormon church waited until the very last minute to bring home missionaries from the Philippines. Even travel restrictions by the US government didn't phase them. It took the president of the Philippines fucking threatening to kill people who violated quarantined for the Mormon church to take this seriously. Now that most international flight schedules have been canceled, their only option is to charter jets, hence the Fiji Airways and LATAM flights.\n\nFrom their own website, it appears that these are VERY recent developments. By recent, I mean APRIL-recent. And as for the Fiji Airways flight, it is still in the air as I am writing this. [The Mormon website](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/coronavirus-update#missionary-work) states that only two missionaries have tested positive for the virus so far, and all are being ordered to self-isolate in their homes before returning to missionary activities in the USA. If you're reading this and thinking \"what the actual fuck, I've been quarantined for almost 3 weeks and they're just brining back missionaries now?\", you're not alone.\n\nSo what businesses will be affected by this? **EVERY BUSINESS THAT USES CALL CENTERS BASED IN AMERICA.** American call centers frequently favor Utah because of its large population of well-educated young adults: [https://www.standard.net/news/business/low-cost-young-workforce-makes-utah-a-magnet-for-call/article\\_186c92d0-e2c2-552e-add6-59127ddd8468.html](https://www.standard.net/news/business/low-cost-young-workforce-makes-utah-a-magnet-for-call/article_186c92d0-e2c2-552e-add6-59127ddd8468.html). Additionally, Skywest is based in Utah. If you're wondering where the connection between Mormons and Utah is, then you simply haven't been to Utah. In fact, it is safe to assume that Utah is the **only** state still experiencing an influx of international travel.\n\nMormons are good people, just like the rest of us. It is a shame those in charge of their organization failed to recognize this potential risk and is now endangering an entire state. I do not currently hold any positions related to this, as I have just made the discovery today. With that said, I am a full on bear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR \u2013** The Mormons forgot to bring their kids home from the third world and they're chartering big jets to do it now.

I ended up getting to $13,000... Only to start losing it. It started as small loses here and there but eventually grinded me down. I'd usually buy puts, lose money then flip to calls, and make a big back, but often times without day trades I'd baghold and opens would just absolutely obliterate my [account ](https://imgur.com/gallery/SQWLvo7).\n\nI even threw a small amount of savings at it last week, but to no avail. I decided to throw the last of my account into a spy put or call in the last five minutes today. I couldn't decide which, so I literally flipped a coin. I have literally not made a trade that went my way in the last week and I obviously wouldn't be writing this post if I chose a financially favorable direction so I'm selling what's left tomorrow and getting out of this game.\n\nMy final position is a spy $225p for 05/15.\n\nI feel terrible about this whole thing. I always wondered why we considered ourselves retarded after lurking here for awhile. But I know why I am retarded: For not taking $13,000 and keeping it. The money could have changed my life, and as I become jobless it could have keeped going until the end of the year. Instead, because I likely have a mental disability, I threw it back, wanting more, wanting lightning to strike the same place twice. It did not. I am now nothing but hopeless, sad and retarded. But at least I learned that I am not good at yet another thing.\n\nI'll be around and still lurking, I'm sure but from a distance from now on. I've had my fair share of laughs and the $100+ I've lost since day one was almost worth it just to be along for the ride.\n\nEdit:\nFor the record, I took out that $600 and an additional $2000 for savings.

If you do not remove these posts, you are put on notice that this will become a legal matter. Our legal department are already investigating two prior posts you made where you stated that you were ready to \"burn down the building\" as well as making the following statement: \u201c if I can\u2019t get my money back I\u2019ll be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way I can.''\"\n\nObviously the quotes in the email don't provide full context but the cops understood that and read it back to me. \n\nParaphrasing here but this is the comment regarding burning down the building: \n\n&gt;What is going on with Questrade support? This is such a joke. It pretty much feels like all they're saying is \"too bad so sad\" and \"fuck you\". Honestly getting tired with this.. I feel like I'm going crazy... getting ready to burn down the building. What a joke\n\nSo obviously I was saying it as a figure of speech and not serious in anyway regarding it but regardless Questrade took it to the police. \n\nThe other comment about \"if I can't get my money back I'll be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way I can\" was meant as in them losing potential/current client's commissions. Obviously I didn't mean any harm which I clarified in my reply to the original email. \n\nBasically the police cautioned me and said they don't think I was serious. \n\nThe call I got was around 1:30am EST and I asked if they usually call this late and the officer said that they were just getting to it cause they had more pressing matters (assuming COVID19). \n\nJust a waste of police resources in general if you ask me. Especially during this time. Like the guy from the TradeDesk said to me in an email...\n\n&gt;\"To keep things in perspective, the world is reeling from a tragic situation.  Thousands of people have lost their lives.  Our staff have been working around the clock to help our clients get through this unprecedented crisis.  In response to our genuine attempts to find an amicable solution, you have threatened and insulted our staff.  I urge you to think about your actions.\"\n\nI would urge Questrade to think about their actions. \n\nThe officer also asked me if I was the one writing posts about \"Questrade killing someone's wife\"(?) and I think something about Hitler but I was able to clarify that it wasn't me writing those posts and it was other people who were likely upset. \n\nJust find it pretty ridiculous that police had to waste their time going through screenshots sent by Questrade of their sub... \n\nNot sure why they would waste the police's time with this but it ultimately resulted in nothing. It was, in my opinion, obvious that those comments were both said out of frustration and I removed them (along with all comments) at the request of a Questrade employee as well anyway. \n\n\nI think what people should take away from this though is how poorly Questrade is treating its clients. If I were to phone them and be upset I don't want to be scared of potentially having a criminal charge brought forward on me because they took something I said out of frustration seriously and involved the police. Honestly think their handling of this matter has been incredibly unprofessional throughout. Upsetting to think this was a company I used to admire and recommend to countless people. \n\nEven just a few days before all this happened I was recommending them to friends - https://imgur.com/a/DHVOHhE\n\nIt's amazing to me how poorly they've handled all this and how in less than 3 weeks my opinion of them has done a complete 180. \n\nWhat a joke.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: The IHME model is trash. Media will soon notice. Long volatility via calendars on SPX for low risk high reward.\n\nAll right boys and girls, listen up. Professor BoneMaster's class is now in session. I'm a researcher at a university you've heard of, and I've been following the 'rona closely since January. I told my students to buy SPY puts in mid-February and that the global economy was going to shut down well into the summer only a couple weeks later. I'm up 300% so far by longing volatility, have been mostly cash for the past couple weeks, but am once again confident enough to be back in. As I've now convinced you of my predictive ability, let's get to it.\n\nThesis: The IHME model touted by Trump is bad. It is considerably under-shooting projected death counts. This becoming apparent is a very soon eventuality, which will be the catalyst for the next leg down.\n\nI'm going to try and keep this as simple as possible for the retards. The IHME model works as follows:\n\n1. Assumes cumulative deaths over time follows a curve like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Error\\_Function.svg), but normalized for only positive x,y.\n\n2. Fits parameters that control the shape of the curve for a given location using existing data. Specifically, it fits for the time where rate of change is maximum and the maximum rate itself more-or-less. It then predicts a maximum value based off of that.\n\nSo why is this approach retarded?\n\n1. Assuming a Gaussian-like curve for daily deaths and therefore a sigmoid-like curve for cumulative deaths makes sense in the context of a lot of basic epidemiological (SIR-like) models. We also saw curves like this in Wuhan. We are NOT seeing this in Italy or Spain. See daily infections and deaths for Spain [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/) and Italy [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/). What we are seeing is a leveling off of to a plateau/low angle slope. More later.\n\n2. The US models are fitted using data from Wuhan, Italy, and Spain. We are NOT following social distancing as closely as these countries. As others have posted in this sub, see [NY](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05\\_US\\_New\\_York\\_Mobility\\_Report\\_en.pdf) vs [Italy](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05\\_IT\\_Mobility\\_Report\\_en.pdf) vs [Spain](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-04-05\\_ES\\_Mobility\\_Report\\_en.pdf). Americans are stupid and selfish. We aren't social distancing nearly as well as other countries.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n1. For Italy and Spain, the IHME estimates are getting more and more desperate. I've been watching the realized daily deaths blow outside their confidence bounds for the last few updates. For the most recent model from Wednesday, Italy just blew up the model's **UPPER-FUCKING BOUND** today ([570 realized](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/) vs. [522 max](https://covid19.healthdata.org/italy)). Spain is likely going to do it tomorrow or Sunday at the latest. Needless to say, a predictive model that consistently fails to predict two days out within the fucking 95% confidence interval **IS NOT A GOOD MODEL**. \n\n2. The prediction for the U.S. is going to get double fucked. It suffers from the invalid assumption of a nice Gaussian-like curve, plus it's essentially fit using data that paints a much rosier picture than reality. \n\nDeeper dive:\n\nThe model inherently assumes a notable inflection point. This occurred in Wuhan as the strict lockdown essentially killed almost all spread. The looser restrictions within Italy and Spain have kept the disease reproductive number sufficiently high enough to maintain something along the line of a plateau of daily new infections. Neither country is at the point where herd immunity has any effect, so this might be maintained for some amount of time. This could actually be considered the desired effect of flattening the curve, meaning that the restrictions are enough that the disease is under control but not so strict that you're welding people in their houses. \n\nGiven sufficient time, this will result in herd immunity. However, at the current rate, that would take about 25 years for Italy (2.5 years if rate is 10x under-reported, as thought). If this is in fact something of a steady-state, maintaining it also requires that restrictions are also essentially maintained as-is until vaccinations are possible. If the rate is actually plateaued, then even a slight loosening of restrictions will result in an immediate second wave.\n\nWhat I think is actually happening is something along the lines of a self-limiting population-wide response. With bad news people cower in their homes, but with good news (we passed the peak!) people start going back out again. Good/bad news creates a feedback cycle resulting in a steady-state rate of infections that's just low enough to not overwhelm the hospitals. I call this response the \"BoneMaster Effect\". \n\nI think Fauci et al. is well aware of all of this but waiting to break the news. At least, I would certainly fucking hope so. The IHME models for the US have been relatively accurate, as the curve is absolutely a good fit for initial-&gt;peak infections. But as we've only just started to hit the peak in certain areas, the BoneMaster Effect hasn't come into play yet. We have another week or so until IHME says NY infections will reduce by half (https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/new-york), though their confidence interval is fucking absurd. If by next Friday NY is still getting O(600-700) deaths per day, then people are going to take notice.\n\nSummary of other models:\n\nThe CovidActNow model is equally retarded, but in the other direction. It assumes way too high of a reproductive number with social distancing. The only good model with a fancy website I've found is the Los Alamos [one](https://covid-19.bsvgateway.org/). I've been keeping an eye on it, and they've generally been spot on. Basically, they don't make any explicit assumptions about disease growth rate except that it will trend down, then randomly samples over all possibilities of how the growth rate can change over time. This inherently captures that notion of plateau/low angle decreasing slope. More importantly, take a look at the 'team' leading that model and compare them to the original 'team' for CovidActNow vs. IHME. Notice anything? CovidActNow was started by a bunch of business fucks, IHME is like 90% attractive bio girls, but, by far, the Los Alamos team is the biggest group of nerds out there. Always bet on the nerds.\n\n\nUppies or downies:\n\nNeither. Long volatility. Calendar spreads below present value are the way to go along with a debit call spread for capping \"brrrr\" risk. Wait until you see the first article out hinting that Trump's model is completely fucked.\n\nReal TLDR: **A PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT CONSISTENTLY FAILS TO PREDICT TWO DAYS OUT WITHIN THE FUCKING 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL IS NOT A GOOD MODEL. LONG VOLATILITY. BET ON THE NERDS.**",

        "selftext": "I've been getting lots of messages asking for an update, so here it is: [as of this morning I'm down about $550k on my SPX puts](https://imgur.com/a/nt6BugA). So am I worried? Not really. I'll share with you some of my DD and maybe you'll understand why.\n\n-------\n\nThe latest headlines have been all about how COVID-19 is peaking in NYC and will soon be peaking in the US as a whole. [This is the model](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) cited by the White House and is also the one most often mentioned by the media. It's been continuously revised down over the past weeks, from over 100k deaths, to 90k last week, to 80k Monday and now 60k today.\n\nI won't go into its flaws (the most obvious one being the assumption that there will be no deaths post-June). Instead, I'll elaborate on one of its main assumptions: \"COVID-19 projections **assuming full social distancing through May 2020**\". Is America applying full social distancing right now?\n\n#Exhibit #1: Google's Mobility Report\n\nGoogle recently released [a fascinating report](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on the mobility behavior of various countries (based on anonymized tracking data as of March 29th). These reports compare how much time people are spending in different types of locations (retail stores, grocery stores, parks, transit stations, workplaces and their homes) compared to usual.\n\nHere are the reports for [Italy](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_IT_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) and [Spain](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_ES_Mobility_Report_en.pdf). They look pretty similar, about a 85-90% decrease in traffic to retail, groceries, parks and transit stations.\n\nMeanwhile, this is what [New York](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_US_New_York_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) looks like: -60% retail and transit, -30% groceries, -50% parks. And keep in mind, this is the hardest-hit state in America; states like [Florida](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_US_Florida_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) have even worse numbers.\n\nMy point here is that as of a week ago, [America as a whole](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_US_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) was not even close to enacting social distancing measures on the levels of Spain or Italy. And even if such measures were implemented **now**, it would take at least 2 weeks for their effect to be felt on the charts (look at how long Spain and Italy have been at -90% on their traffic before their numbers leveled off).\n\n#Exhibit #2: Flight Radar\n\nNot only is the US not doing social distancing right, it also hasn't done much to restrict interstate travel. Here's a very telling stat: [2/3rds of global flights on March 28th were above North America](https://twitter.com/flightradar24/status/1244003511098134529). Think that has changed since then? Think again: here's [Europe + Asia + North Africa now](https://i.imgur.com/7etzRT5.png) (1200 flights total, top-left corner), here's just [the eastern states](https://i.imgur.com/hcDYc2T.png) (1500 flights, which is the maximum Flightradar can show on one screen).\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that even the states which are implementing lockdowns and bending the curve now will have fresh new outbreaks as soon as they lift their measures. Air travel is the easiest way for the virus to spread via asymptomatic carriers and the only way to prevent this is a domestic travel ban. That doesn't look like it's gonna happen anytime soon.\n\n#Conclusion\n\nTo me it seems very clear that a large majority of America's population will be contracting this virus over the next month and a half. Italy and Spain made enormous social sacrifices to stop the outbreak and their success is just now becoming apparent. As of right now America is not doing nearly enough to follow in their steps, so exponential growth should continue unabated.\n\nHow does this relate to my SPX puts? How the market responds to this is a topic for another time, but let me just say this: my puts might be down now, but that doesn't mean America is any less fucked.\n\n#Further Reading\n\n[Great overview of the coronavirus situation in America](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-out-of-many-one-36b886af37e9)\n\n[A model that's not nearly as optimistic as whatever the White House is peddling right now](https://www.covidactnow.org/)",

        "selftext": "I just want to ask you what was your original thesis was regarding this medical and financial crisis?\n\nI, for one, am still bearish, even if SP500 goes up 5% tonight. Consider this, during the 2008 financial crisis, the VIX hit an all time high at 89.53 on 10/24/2008. It subsequently crashed down to 44.25 as of 11/4/08 (almost exactly 50% retracement), only to rocket back up to 81.48 as of 11/20/2008. Relatively speaking, options were hella cheap on 11/4/08 considering the turmoil going on at the time. If you were to go back and look, SPY closed at 97.11 on 11/3 and closed at 100.41 on 11/4, +3.4% in the green for the day, and we still had another 34% down left to go!\n\nWhile I'm *not* saying that **FOR SURE** the same thing applies this time, we are now nearly at our 50% retracement point on the VIX. We peaked at 85.47 on 3/18/20 and, as I write this, are at 46.8 late in the evening on 4/5/20 (45% retracement). For me, I still have A LOT of unresolved questions about this market that feed my bearish sentiments. For one, we are GOING to have [record unemployment](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate), and I just don't see that getting fixed quickly. Yes, stimulus checks, unemployment income boosts, and generous federal loan programs for small businesses help, but what about the negative [wealth effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealtheffect.asp) on consumption? What about [over-leveraged corporations who were pleading for mercy the very INSTANT their revenues were disrupted](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airlines-plead-state-relief-virus-190239895.html)? What about the [retailers refusing to pay rent](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-04/coronavirus-landlords-in-peril-as-retailers-refuse-to-pay-rent)?\n\nThe reality is that even countries like Italy, where there have been steady declines in new cases and deaths are [extending out their stay at home orders](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/01/825499871/italy-seen-by-white-house-as-a-u-s-analogue-extends-nationwide-lockdown) because the country doesn't want \"the curve\" to bend back so soon. We **MIGHT** be seeing the top of the curve for New York right now, but the rest of the country? Most of the regions are still going up! Just because the curve has started to bend back the other way, doesn't mean we can all just open up shop again and everything is dandy. Hell, even in China where they allegedly are all back to work, [look at their weekend traffic](https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/shanghai-traffic/)! There are a lot of unanswered questions left, and many of them do not have easy answers.\n\nSo should you sell or should you hold your puts? **Idk, that's for you to decide.** But before you get all wrapped up in Trump and OPEC's bullish oil thesis (which is a whole 'nother \"no easy answers\" situation by itself), consider just how easily this recent whiff of positive sentiment can be swept away once the other realities of this present crisis are front and center and start needing to be addressed..\n\nGood Luck, God Speed.",

        "selftext": "Hello, dummies\n\nIt's your old pal, Fuzzy.\n\nAs I'm sure you've all noticed, a lot of the stuff that gets posted here is - to put it delicately - fucking ridiculous. More backwards-ass shit gets posted to r/wallstreetbets than you'd see on a Westboro Baptist community message board. I mean, I had a look at the daily threat yesterday and..... yeesh. I know, I know. [We all make like the divine Laura Dern circa 1992 on the daily](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8661496232_2df568ba28_n.jpg) and stick our hands deep into this steaming heap of shit to find the nuggets of valuable and/or hilarious information within (thanks for reading, BTW). I agree. I love it just the way it is too. That's what makes WSB great.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that a lot of the stuff that gets posted here - notwithstanding it being funny or interesting - is just... wrong. Like, fucking your cousin wrong. And to be clear, I mean the fucking your \\*first\\* cousin kinda wrong, before my Southerners in the back get all het up (simmer down, Billy Ray - I know Mabel's twice removed on your grand-sister's side). Truly, I try to let it slide. [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/) [do](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fplquv/something_fishy_fuzzys_seas_covenant_breakdown/) [my](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqk15o/fallen_angels_shitty_cars_worse_debt_and_what_it/) [bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsbto9/the_ballad_of_big_dick_vick_onions_futures_and/) to try and put you on the right path. Most of the time, I sleep easy no matter how badly I've seen someone explain what a bank liquidity crisis is. But out of all of those tens of thousands of misguided, autistic attempts at understanding the world of high finance, one thing gets so consistently - so \\*emphatically\\* - fucked up and misunderstood by you retards that last night I felt obligated at the end of a long work day to pull together this edition of *Finance with Fuzzy* just for you. It's so serious I'm not even going to make a u/pokimane gag. Have you guessed what it is yet? Here's a clue. It's in the title of the post.\n\nThat's right, friends. Today in the neighborhood we're going to talk all about **hedging in financial markets** \\- spots, swaps, collars, forwards, CDS, synthetic CDOs, all that fun shit. Don't worry; I'm going to explain what all the scary words mean and how they impact your OTM RH positions along the way.\n\nWe're going to break it down like this. (1) \"What's a hedge, Fuzzy?\" (2) Common Hedging Strategies and (3) All About ISDAs and Credit Default Swaps.\n\nBefore we begin. For the nerds and JV traders in the back (and anyone else who needs to hear this up front) - I am simplifying these descriptions for the purposes of this post. I am also obviously not going to try and cover every exotic form of hedge under the sun or give a detailed summation of what caused the financial crisis. If you are interested in something specific ask a question, but don't try and impress me with your Investopedia skills or technical points I didn't cover; I will just be forced to flex my years of IRL experience on you in the comments and you'll look like a big dummy.\n\n**TL;DR?** Fuck you. There is no TL;DR. You've come this far already. What's a few more paragraphs? Put down the Cheetos and try to concentrate for the next 5-7 minutes. You'll learn something, and I promise I'll be gentle.\n\nReady? Let's get started.\n\n**1.** **The Tao of Risk: Hedging as a Way of Life**\n\nThe simplest way to characterize what a hedge 'is' is to imagine every action having a binary outcome. One is bad, one is good. Red lines, green lines; uppie, downie. With me so far? Good. A 'hedge' is simply the employment of a strategy to mitigate the effect of your action having the *wrong* binary outcome. You wanted X, but you got Z! Frowny face. A hedge strategy introduces a *third* outcome. If you hedged against the *possibility* of Z happening,  then you can wind up with Y instead. Not as good as X, but not as bad as Z. The technical definition I like to give my idiot juniors is as follows:\n\n*Utilization of a defensive strategy to mitigate risk, at a fraction of the cost to capital of the risk itself*.\n\nCongratulations. You just finished Hedging 101. \"But Fuzzy, that's easy! I just sold a naked call against my 95% OTM put! I'm adequately hedged!\". Spoiler alert: you're not (although good work on executing a collar, which I describe below). What I'm talking about here is what would be referred to as a 'perfect hedge'; a binary outcome where downside is totally mitigated by a risk management strategy. That's not how it works IRL. Pay attention; this is the tricky part.\n\nYou can't take a single position and conclude that you're adequately hedged because risks are fluid, not static. So you need to constantly adjust your position in order to maximize the value of the hedge and insure your position. You also need to consider exposure to more than one category of risk. There are micro (specific exposure) risks, and macro (trend exposure) risks, and both need to factor into the hedge calculus.\n\nThat's why, in the real world, the value of hedging depends entirely on the design of the hedging strategy itself. Here, when we say \"value\" of the hedge, we're not talking about cash money - we're talking about the intrinsic value of the hedge relative to the the risk profile of your underlying exposure. To achieve this, people hedge ***dynamically***. In r/wallstreetbets terms, this means that as the value of your position changes, you need to change your hedges too. The idea is to efficiently and continuously distribute and rebalance risk across different states and periods, taking value from states in which the marginal cost of the hedge is low and putting it back into states where marginal cost of the hedge is high, until the shadow value of your underlying exposure is equalized across your positions. The punchline, I guess, is that one static position is a hedge in the same way that the finger paintings you make for your wife's boyfriend are art - it's technically correct, but you're only playing yourself by believing it. \n\nAnyway. Obviously doing this as a small potatoes trader is hard but it's worth taking into account. Enough basic shit. So how does this work in markets?\n\n**2. A Hedging Taxonomy**\n\nThe best place to start here is a practical question. What does a business need to hedge against? Think about the specific risk that an individual business faces. These are legion, so I'm just going to list a few of the key ones that apply to most corporates. (1) You have commodity risk for the shit you buy or the shit you use. (2) You have currency risk for the money you borrow. (3) You have rate risk on the debt you carry. (4) You have offtake risk for the shit you sell. Complicated, right? To help address the many and varied ways that shit can go wrong in a sophisticated market, smart operators like yours truly have devised a whole bundle of different instruments which can help you manage the risk. I might write about some of the more complicated ones in a later post if people are interested (CDO/CLOs, strip/stack hedges and bond swaps with option toggles come to mind) but let's stick to the basis for now.\n\n(i) Swaps\n\nA swap is one of the most common forms of hedge instrument, and they're used by pretty much everyone that can afford them. The language is complicated but the concept isn't, so pay attention and you'll be fine. This is the most important part of this section so it'll be the longest one.\n\nSwaps are derivative contracts with two counterparties (before you ask, you can't trade 'em on an exchange - they're OTC instruments only). They're used to exchange one cash flow for another cash flow of equal expected value; doing this allows you to take speculative positions on certain financial prices or to alter the cash flows of existing assets or liabilities within a business. \"Wait, Fuzz; slow down! What do you mean sets of cash flows?\". Fear not, little autist. Ol' Fuzz has you covered.\n\nThe cash flows I'm talking about are referred to in swap-land as 'legs'. One leg is fixed -  a set payment that's the same every time it gets paid - and the other is variable - it fluctuates (typically indexed off the price of the underlying risk that you are speculating on / protecting against). You set it up at the start so that they're notionally equal and the two legs net off; so at open, the swap is a zero NPV instrument. Here's where the fun starts. If the price that you based the variable leg of the swap on changes, the value of the swap will shift; the party on the wrong side of the move ponies up via the variable payment. It's a zero sum game.\n\nI'll give you an example using the most vanilla swap around; an interest rate trade. Here's how it works. You borrow money from a bank, and they charge you a rate of interest. You lock the rate up front, because you're smart like that. But then - *quelle surprise*! - the rate gets **better** after you borrow. Now you're bagholding to the tune of, I don't know, 5 bps. Doesn't sound like much but on a billion dollar loan that's a lot of money (a classic example of the kind of 'small, deep hole' that's terrible for profits). Now, if you had a swap contract on the rate before you entered the trade, you're set; if the rate goes down, you get a payment under the swap. If it goes up, whatever payment you're making to the bank is netted off by the fact that you're borrowing at a sub-market rate. Win-win! Or, at least, Lose Less / Lose Less. That's the name of the game in hedging.\n\nThere are **many** different kinds of swaps, some of which are pretty exotic; but they're all different variations on the same theme. If your business has exposure to something which fluctuates in price, you trade swaps to hedge against the fluctuation. The valuation of swaps is also super interesting but I guarantee you that 99% of you won't understand it so I'm not going to try and explain it here although I encourage you to google it if you're interested.\n\nBecause they're OTC, none of them are filed publicly. Someeeeeetimes you see an ISDA (dsicussed below) but the confirms themselves (the individual swaps) are not filed. You can usually read about the hedging strategy in a 10-K, though. For what it's worth, most modern credit agreements ban non-speculative hedging. Top tip: This is occasionally something worth checking in credit agreements when you invest in businesses that are debt issuers - being able to do this increases the risk profile significantly and is particularly important in times of economic volatility (ctrl+f \"non-speculative\" in the credit agreement to be sure).\n\n(ii) Forwards\n\nA forward is a contract made today for the future delivery of an asset at a pre-agreed price. That's it. \"But Fuzzy! That sounds just like a futures contract!\". I know. Confusing, right? Just like a futures trade, forwards are generally used in commodity or forex land to protect against price fluctuations. The differences between forwards and futures are small but significant. I'm not going to go into **super** boring detail because I don't think many of you are commodities traders but it is still an important thing to understand even if you're just an RH jockey, so stick with me.\n\nJust like swaps, forwards are OTC contracts - they're not publicly traded. This is distinct from futures, which are traded on exchanges (see [The Ballad Of Big Dick Vick](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsbto9/the_ballad_of_big_dick_vick_onions_futures_and/) for some more color on this). In a forward, no money changes hands until the maturity date of the contract when delivery and receipt are carried out; price and quantity are locked in from day 1. As you now know having read about BDV, futures are marked to market daily, and normally people close them out with synthetic settlement using an inverse position.  They're also liquid, and that makes them easier to unwind or close out in case shit goes sideways.\n\nPeople use forwards when they absolutely have to get rid of the thing they made (or take delivery of the thing they need). If you're a miner, or a farmer, you use this shit to make sure that at the end of the production cycle, you can get rid of the shit you made (and you won't get fucked by someone taking cash settlement over delivery). If you're a buyer, you use them to guarantee that you'll get whatever the shit is that you'll need at a price agreed in advance. Because they're OTC, you can also exactly tailor them to the requirements of your particular circumstances.\n\nThese contracts are incredibly byzantine (and there are even crazier synthetic forwards you can see in money markets for the true degenerate fund managers). In my experience, only Texan oilfield magnates, commodities traders, and the weirdo forex crowd fuck with them. I (i) do not own a 10 gallon hat or a novelty size belt buckle (ii) do not wake up in the middle of the night freaking out about the price of pork fat and (iii) love greenbacks too much to care about other countries' monopoly money, so I don't fuck with them.\n\n(iii) Collars\n\nNo, not the kind your wife is encouraging you to wear try out to 'spice things up' in the bedroom during quarantine. Collars are actually the hedging strategy **most applicable** to WSB. Collars deal with options! Hooray!\n\nTo execute a basic collar (also called a wrapper by tea-drinking Brits and people from the Antipodes), you buy an put out of the money put while simultaneously writing a covered call on the same equity. The put protects your position against price drops and writing the call produces income that offsets the put premium. Doing this limits your tendies (you can only profit up to the strike price of the put) but also writes down your risk. If you screen large volume trades with a VOL/OI of more than 3 or 4x (and they're not bullshit biotech stocks), you can sometimes see these being constructed in real time as hedge funds protect themselves on their shorts.\n\n**(3) All About ISDAs, CDS and Synthetic CDOs**\n\nYou may have heard about the mythical [ISDA](https://www.isda.org/a/23iME/Legal-Guidelines-for-Smart-Derivatives-Contracts-ISDA-Master-Agreement.pdf). Much like an indenture (discussed in my post on $F), it's a magic legal machine that lets you build swaps via trade confirms with a willing counterparty. They are **very complicated** legal documents and you need to be a true expert to fuck with them. Fortunately, I am, so I do. They're made of two parts; a Master (which is a form agreement that's always the same) and a Schedule (which amends the Master to include your specific terms). They are also the engine behind just about every major credit crunch of the last 10+ years.\n\nFirst - a brief explainer. An ISDA is a not in and of itself a hedge - it's an umbrella contract that governs the terms of your swaps, which you use to construct your hedge position. You can trade commodities, forex, rates, whatever, all under the same ISDA. They're also responsible for just about every major credit crunch in the last two decades.\n\nLet me explain. Remember when we talked about swaps? Right. So. You can trade swaps on just about anything. In the late 90s and early 2000s, people had the smart idea of using other people's debt and or credit ratings as the variable leg of swap documentation. These are called **credit default swaps**. I was actually starting out at a bank during this time and, I gotta tell you, the only thing I can compare people's enthusiasm for this shit to was that moment in your early teens when you discover jerking off. Except, unlike your bathroom bound shame sessions to Mom's Sears catalogue, every single person you know felt that way too; and they're all doing it at once. It was a fiscal circlejerk of epic proportions, and the financial crisis was the inevitable bukkake finish. WSB autism is absolutely no comparison for the enthusiasm people had during this time for lighting each other's money on fire.\n\nHere's how it works. You pick a company. Any company. Maybe even your own! And then you write a swap. In the swap, you define \"Credit Event\" with respect to that company's debt as the variable leg . And you write in... whatever you want. A ratings downgrade, default under the docs, failure to meet a leverage ratio or FCCR for a certain testing period... whatever. Now, this started out as a hedge position, just like we discussed above. The purest of intentions, of course. But then people realized - if bad shit happens, **you make money**. And banks... don't like calling in loans or forcing bankruptcies. Can you smell what the moral hazard is cooking?\n\nEnter synthetic CDOs. CDOs are basically pools of asset backed securities that invest in debt (loans or bonds). They've been around for a minute but they got famous in the 2000s because a shitload of them containing subprime mortgage debt went belly up in 2008. This got a lot of publicity because a lot of sad looking rednecks got foreclosed on and were interviewed on CNBC. \"OH!\", the people cried. \"Look at those big bad bankers buying up subprime loans! They caused this!\". Wrong answer, America. The debt wasn't the problem. What a lot of people don't realize is that the real meat of the problem was not in regular way CDOs investing in bundles of shit mortgage debts in **synthetic CDOs investing in CDS predicated on that debt**. They're *synthetic* because they don't have a stake in the actual underlying debt; just the instruments riding on the coattails. The reason these are so popular (and remain so) is that smart structured attorneys and bankers like your faithful correspondent realized that an even **more** profitable and efficient way of building high yield products with limited downside was investing in instruments that profit from failure of debt **and in** instruments that rely on that debt and then hedging *that* exposure with other CDS instruments in paired trades, and on and on up the chain. The problem with doing this was that everyone wound up exposed to everybody else's books as a result, and when one went tits up, everybody did. Hence, recession, Basel III, etc. Thanks, Obama.\n\nHeavy investment in CDS can also have a warping effect on the price of debt (something else that happened during the pre-GFC years and is starting to happen again now).  This happens in three different ways. (1) Investors who previously were long on the debt hedge their position by **selling** CDS protection on the underlying, putting downward pressure on the debt price. (2) Investors who previously shorted the debt switch to **buying** CDS protection because the relatvively illiquid debt (partic. when its a bond) trades at a discount below par compared to the CDS. The resulting reduction in short selling puts upward pressure on the bond price. (3) The delta in price and actual value of the debt tempts some investors to become NBTs (neg basis traders) who long the debt and purchase CDS protection. If traders can't take leverage, nothing happens to the price of the debt. If basis traders **can** take leverage (which is nearly always the case because they're holding a hedged position), they can push up the debt price, goosing swap premiums etc. Anyway. Enough technical details. \n\nI could keep going. This is a fascinating topic that is very poorly understood and explained, mainly because the people that caused it all still work on the street and use the same tactics today (it's also *terribly* taught at business schools because none of the teachers were actually around to see how this played out live). But it relates to the topic of today's lesson, so I thought I'd include it here.\n\nWork depending, I'll be back next week with a covenant breakdown. Most upvoted ticker gets the post.",

        "selftext": "Hello, friends -\n\nIt's me, Fuzzy. Welcome back. I know, I know. I'm excited too. I had this up at market open but it got spiked by automod \\*twice\\* so I'm hoping third time's the charm. \n\nDid you guys see that movie, *The Accountant*? The one where [Sad Ben Affleck](https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ab58b2922f093031d9fb8fa/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Fry-The-Great-Sadness-of-Ben-Affleck.jpg) plays an autistic accountant for organized crime who doubles as a stone-cold killer? Yeah, me neither.  I mainly remember it exists because it features Anna Kendrick, a Fuzzy Fave (TM). In the March Madness for my heart, she's a 4 or 5 seed in her conference for sure (look out, u/pokimane). Anyway, that's what we're going to be talking about today. No, not March Madness (never got the fuss) or Sad Ben Affleck (21st century existential icon) - not even Fuzzy's Faves. Today, we're all about bean-counting - specifically, EBITDA, the magic number that makes all of your accounting problems disappear. I figured it was time you autists got to learnin' how businesses can lose money on paper but still be in the green with their creditors - especially at the moment, what with the bat flu and all, when many businesses are trying to explain that no one should panic and they're still in the black (even though they're definitely not). Let's get started.\n\nNow - disclaimer - I am **not** an accountant (obviously). If you are, feel free to flex in the comments and explain to me how mastery of forward-looking deduction writeoffs or some other fucking word jumble would make me a more complete human and save me $0.03 on my taxes every second five-year rolling addback window. The thing is, like most people that wind up on the human facing side of the finance industry, I cared too much about getting laid in college to give a shit about how to make numbers dance on a P/L statement, so I never really bothered to learn much more than the basics.  Once you hit the real world, though, those pocket-protecting calculator jockeys get preeeetty important, pretty fast. Tax, forensics, regular ol' corporate book-keeping - in business-land, you name it, you need an accountant to either do it for you or sign off on it before you send it to the board. So, you know, accountants. Not all bad.\n\nAnyway, even though I'm not an accountant, one thing I **do** know a lot about is EBITDA. Why? Because it's one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds of modern corporate finance, so I deal with it every day. \"But Fuzzy! How can you negotiate something that's an established accounting concept? Isn't that like trying to change 2+2 so it equals 5?\" And the answer - if EBITDA was a regular accounting concept - would be yes. But fortunately for borrowers, private equity cowboys and corporate finance lawyers (as well as lovers of weasel words everywhere), it's not, so you can. See, there's a difference between GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and... well everything that's not GAAP. You can't fuck with GAAP. How something \\*becomes\\* or even \\*became\\* GAAP in the first place... unclear. I guess in ancient times some bespectacled prophet came down from Mt. Nerd with spreadsheets carved on stone tablets, and whatever was on them wound up being generally accepted. I don't know, I'm not a fucking theologian. But however it happened, you can't fuck with it. Happily, though, EBITDA is non-GAAP, so like all the best girls, it's whatever you want it to be.\n\nBut we're getting ahead of ourselves. Today's post is going to be a tale of two halves. We're going to go through what EBITDA is and why it's important, and then we're going to go through a meme-tastic example to show how it can be manipulated - using everyone's favorite manufacturer of tendie-powered cars, rocketships, and flamethrowers... $TSLA!\n\nIf you want to play along at home, here's [$TSLA's 10-K](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/07bfcb70-aba1-4a27-af09-4f101678320c). Now I know people get all hot and bothered about $TSLA for whatever reason (did you know there's a dedicated Tesla investors subreddit? fucking weird). So let's get this clear from the jump - every single company does this, and I'm not implying that $TSLA is doing anything 'wrong' or 'bad'. I don't give a shit about the ticker or the cars or Elon's mission to put weed on Mars or whatever the fuck he's doing these days, so don't come at me in the comments about any of that shit. They're just the example we're using to work through this exercise. They've actually got a fascinating debt structure that is worthy of its own post (Musk or his family can take it private at any point without triggering a change of control under the docs... what?!), but today we're limiting our scope to the way they're allowed to calculate EBITDA.\n\nOK. Ready? Let's do this. Sincere and/or funny questions in the comments answered as always.\n\n1. **EBITDA - A User's Guide**\n\nWhen it comes to people, it's pretty easy to measure performance. Where you went to school, how much you make, where you live, how hot your wife is, how long... you get the idea. The point is that life is full of concrete, objective measures to help you figure out how worthwhile (or not) you really are as a human. Stretch out to the \"All Time\" view on your RH graph to give yourself an idea of where you sit.\n\nBusinesses have a bunch of these metrics they can look at. Profits, cashflow, sales... the list goes on. The issues with most of those, though, is that running a business is a pretty complicated job. There's a whole lot of shit that goes into those numbers each financial year, and not all of it is necessarily indicative of the 'normal' baseline of performance. Maybe you have a bad quarter because of the 'rona (pour one out for $WFC..... yikes). Maybe you get slugged with a tax bill, or a big interest repayment from your bank. Now that might hurt your operating profit on a one-off basis, but it's not something you expect to keep happening. You don't want your shareholders to freak out over nothing. That's where EBITDA comes in (say it like EEE-BIT-DAH).\n\nEBITDA stands for **E**arnings **B**efore **I**nterest **T**axes **D**epreciation and **A**mortization. The idea is essentially to find that baseline - to produce a number which reflects the true earnings of the business when the pernicious influence of taxes, financing, and accounting is taken out of the equation. Basically, you calculate it by **adding back** non-cash expenses to your baseline operating income. That's it. Simple, right? \"OK Fuzz, but what's a non-cash expense? Couldn't that be like... anything?\" Exactly.\n\nBecause EBITDA as a concept is more malleable than your more... black and white metrics, borrowers like to use it in loan documentation - particularly in leveraged finance, where it typically serves as the measure of earnings for the company. It's also used as a building block of incurrence baskets - the higher your EBITDA, the more you get to utilize under a particular basket. Usually this is done by way of a either/or construct - you can have $50 million **or** $25%  (or whatever) of your EBITDA, whichever is greater. It also turns up in financial covenants and step-downs in asset sale sweeps, excess cash flow sweeps, and pricing. There's a bunch of other non-finance ways it gets used too, but we're just going to stick to this for now.\n\nSometimes companies will try and flex their 'record EBITDA' numbers in a 10-K. But if you read on, you'll see  that every time they do this, it's qualified by the fact that it's non-GAAP and not accepted blah blah blah. So just be mindful of that when you're reviewing those documents and always read the real numbers before you make a call on how the business is actually doing.\n\nAnyway, let's see how it can be manipulated.\n\n2. **Cookin' With Elon - The $TSLA Example**\n\nLet's take a peek under the hood of [$TSLA's Credit Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312519095913/d625340dex1068.htm) to see what's going on with their EBITDA. Remember how I said you could calculate EBITDA by just adding back non-cash expenses to operating income? That's right... in theory. Have a look at this (just skim it, reading it cold will give you a headache. I'm going to break it down for you anyway - this is just for illustrative purposes):\n\n&gt;\u201cConsolidated EBITDA\u201d shall mean, for any period, Consolidated Net Income for such period (without giving effect to (w)\u00a0any extraordinary gains or losses, (x)\u00a0any non-cash income, (y)\u00a0any gains or losses from sales of assets other than those assets sold in the ordinary course of business, or (z)\u00a0any foreign currency gains or losses) adjusted by (A)\u00a0adding thereto (in each case to the extent deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period (other than clause (ix)\u00a0below which need not be so deducted)), without duplication, the amount of (i)\u00a0total interest expense (inclusive of amortization or write-off of deferred financing fees and other original issue discount and banking fees, charges and commissions (e.g., letter of credit issuance and facing fees (including Letter of Credit Fees and Facing Fees), commitment fees, issuance costs and other transactional costs)) of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (ii)\u00a0provision for taxes based on income and foreign withholding taxes for the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries (including state, franchise, capital and similar taxes paid or accrued) determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iii)\u00a0all depreciation and amortization expense of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iv)\u00a0in the case of any period, the amount of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction (including in connection with any amendments to the Credit Documents) during such fiscal quarter, (v)\u00a0any unusual or non-recurring cash charges, (vi)\u00a0any cash restructuring charges or reserves (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include retention, severance, system establishment costs, excess pension charges, contract and lease termination costs and costs to consolidate facilities and relocate employees) for such period (a)(x) incurred in connection with an Acquisition consummated after the Effective Date or (y)\u00a0otherwise incurred in connection with the Company\u2019s and its Consolidated Subsidiaries\u2019 operations in an aggregate amount for all cash charges added back pursuant to this clause (vi)\u00a0not to exceed 15% of Consolidated EBITDA in any Test Period (calculated before giving effect to this clause (vi)), (vii) any expenses incurred in connection with any actual or proposed Investment, incurrence, amendment or repayment of Indebtedness, issuance of Equity Interests or acquisition or disposition, in each case, outside the ordinary course of business for such period, (viii)\u00a0expenses incurred to the extent covered by indemnification provisions in any agreement in connection with an acquisition to the extent reimbursed in cash to the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries and such indemnification payments are not otherwise included in Consolidated Net Income, in each case, for such period, (ix)\u00a0proceeds received by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries from any business interruption insurance to the extent such proceeds are not otherwise included in such Consolidated Net Income for such period, (x)\u00a0all other non-cash charges of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (xi) \\[RESERVED\\], and (xii)\u00a0any expenses associated with stock based compensation and (B)\u00a0subtracting therefrom (to the extent not otherwise deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period)\u00a0(i) the amount of all cash payments or cash charges made (or incurred) by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries for such period on account of any non-cash charges added back to Consolidated EBITDA pursuant to preceding sub-clause (A)(x) in a previous period and (ii)\u00a0any unusual or non-recurring cash gains. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that, to the extent any amounts are excluded from Consolidated Net Income by virtue of the proviso to the definition thereof contained herein, any add backs to Consolidated Net Income in determining Consolidated EBITDA as provided above shall be limited (or denied) in a fashion consistent with the proviso to the definition of Consolidated Net Income contained herein\n\nYowza. That's a mouthful, huh? So in this bullshit alphabet soup are some key phrases that we are going to look at to see how businesses can manipulate their YOY figures to appear a bit... better than they would be otherwise. There are your normal should be in there things too, but most is bullshit. Let's pick out the five big ones. My comments on how these can be manipulated are in ALL CAPS after each one.\n\n(1) Transaction costs (with respect to both closing date transactions and other permitted transactions) THIS BASICALLY MEANS THEY CAN SPEND HOWEVER MUCH MONEY THEY WANT ON WHATEVER THEY WANT AS LONG AS IT'S ALLOWED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THEY CAN ADD IT BACK. THEY CAN ALSO INCLUDE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LAWYERS (BECAUSE WE'RE EXPENSIVE), ACCOUNTANTS, CONSULTANTS, WITCH DOCTORS, STRIPPERS... YOU GET THE IDEA. THIS IS ONE WAY THAT CASHFLOW NEGATIVE COMPANIES CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EBITA - YOU SPEND EVERYTHING ON MORE SHIT AND YOU GET CREDITED FOR IT. TSLA ARE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A COMPANY THAT WOULD USE THIS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT MODE. ALL THAT CRAZY SHIT ELON DOES THAT PISSES AWAY MONEY WOULD GO RIGHT HERE AS A CREDIT TO THE BUSINESS.\n\n(2) Cash restructuring charges / reserves (capped at 15% of EBITDA) DOWNSIZING, CONSOLIDATION, FURLOUGHING PEOPLE, PAYING TO GET PEOPLE KILLED - IF IT MEANS A CHANGE TO YOUR BUSINESS THAT INVOLVES MOVING PEOPLE AROUND OR GETTING RID OF THEM, YOU CAN ADD IT BACK HERE. SAME GOES FOR CASH RESERVES YOU'VE ESTABLISHED. GET A DOUBLE CREDIT FOR SPENDING **AND** NOT SPENDING MONEY!\n\n(3) Pro forma cost savings projected to be realized from any material business acquisition (exceeding &gt; of $60 million / 1% of total assets) THIS ONE IS ALWAYS FUNNY TO ME. THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU BUY SOMETHING THAT COMPLEMENTS YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS, EVEN IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTIVELY LOSING MONEY, YOU CAN GET A CREDIT FOR THE SYNERGIES IT WILL HAVE WITH YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS. COMBINE WITH ADDBACK (1) ABOVE FOR A REALLY GOO TIME - DOUBLE DIP ON BUYING CASH BURNING BUSINESSES AND JUST TELL PEOPLE IT'S SYNERGISTIC. WOO, FISCAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING!\n\n(4) extraordinary losses PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. IF SOMETHING FEELS WEIRD TO YOU, YOU CAN PROBABLY ADD IT BACK HERE. THERE IS NO BASELINE FOR THIS. IT'S WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE AT ANY POINT IN TIME AND THE BANK CAN'T STOP YOU.\n\n(5) unusual and/or non-recurring cash charges WHERE YOU CLAIM WRITEOFFS FOR YOUR CEO'S WIFE'S BOYFRIEND'S SECRET FAMILY IN OMAHA'S CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. YOU CAN SERIOUSLY USE THIS FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU CAN SAY IT'S (I) NOT SOMETHING YOU'D DO EVERY DAY AND (II) IT PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. INTERESTINGLY SOME BUSINESSES ARE TRYING TO CLAIM CORONA-RELATED CREDITS HERE TO STEER THEM THROUGH THIS EARNINGS SEASON WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH NEGATIVE EBITDA.\n\nThis is just $TSLA, and honestly their definition isn't even that complicated. Seriously - go to your favorite ticker's 10-K, find the credit agreement, and CTRL+F \"Consolidated EBITDA\" and \"Consolidated Net Income\". Try and read it for yourself and tell me if you think that makes up anything other than a shitty madlib - let alone a real performance metric for a business.\n\nAnyway. That's today's post. $LYV breakdown later in the week. $LULU on Friday.\n\nFuzzy",

        "selftext": "On behalf of u/jartek, u/Arigold212855 and all the mods, we want to acknowledge and give thanks to EVERYONE that has been a part of WSB throughout the years! We are all very grateful and humbled at this amazing community of autists. YOU ARE ALL APPRECIATED. THANK YOU!\n\nWithin the past year there have been a lot of changes within the WSB community and to be honest, we have done a lousy job effectively communicating these changes in a way that is transparent and inclusive of our members. As a result of this, we know that a lot of you are frustrated and unsure of what is taking place and what the future holds for WSB.\n\nWe want to address each major change and issue with transparency and thoroughness:\n___\n\n- **The Creation of the New Discord Server and Stricter Rules Within It.**\n\nA certain level of \u201cchaos\u201d has helped WSB thrive. It\u2019s a huge part of what attracts members and attention and it\u2019s something WE ALL LOVE! The previous Discord server started off with that level of chaos that has made WSB great, but then took a sharp turn towards something else entirely. \n\nFor a long time, we have had reports of frequent and large-scale incidents of racism, acts of hate and pornographic content that appeared to include minors were taking place within that Discord server. There was an effort made to communicate with the mods on that server some of which were mods on the WSB sub, but we were never able to fully confirm what if any actions were being taken to mitigate these things from happening and eventually made the decision to separate and create a new Discord server and implement stricter rules and a zero-tolerance policy for all aforementioned content.\n___\n- **The Release of Jartek\u2019s Book**\n\nThe creation, publishing, and sale of this book was a way to increase awareness of what WSB is, how it got started and what makes it the top financial community online today, by far, as told by the person who created the WHOLE THING! \n\nTHANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT SUPPORTED THE BOOK!\n___\n- **Creation and Sudden Replacement of the WSB Logo.**\n\nWE LOVED THE OLD LOGO and did not want to change it! We had no choice. While it\u2019s true the individual who claimed to have made this logo for us said we could keep using it this same individual, unfortunately, STOLE IT from someone else\u2019s TED talk presentation many years ago. The more exposure the WSB received the greater chance of cease and desist notices to continue. To not fight what would have been a losing battle and at the advice of our lawyers, we abruptly changed the logo to what it is now. \n\nHere is the \u201csilver lining\u201d: we\u2019ll be allowing ANYONE that wants to contribute to a new logo to do so, as we will be redesigning what\u2019s there. More details soon! (a couple of days). \n___\n- **The WSB Championship Trading Competition and True Trading Group as a sponsor.**\n\nFirst off, we ALL fully acknowledge this was announced terribly, lacking transparency and member inclusion, and we\u2019re about to rectify that. Not because we must, but because WE ALL GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ALL OF YOU!\n\nThis event will be the way WSB publicly kicks down the doors of finance, its communities and shakes it all to its core! This will be the way WSB lets the world know we\u2019re more than a subreddit, we are a fucking financial movement, and this is how we GET SHIT DONE!\n\nThis event will be the first ever E-sports style LIVE trading event where contestants risk their own money at a chance to win a large cash prize that FAR supersedes the money they are risking.\n\nThink \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d type announcing with WSB brand of chaos while contestants risk losing it all or making sweet, sweet tendies!\n\nWe are compiling a detailed Q&amp;A list and FULL video that explains the rules of the competition and all other details that we will be launching soon. Once launched, we will do a full AMA for the sub and Discord.\n___\n- **On the topic of True Trading Group as a Sponsor**\n\nHistorically, services like True Trading Group have been BANNED from WSB and for good reasons, that we\u2019re all aware of. \n\n**HOWEVER**\n\nThe owners of TTG reached out to jartek 8 months ago and instead of offering money to him or other mods to shill their version of a \u201cmillionaire-making trading community/service,\u201d they took the approach of asking him if he would take some time and give them his opinion on what they had built. \n\nu/jartek accepted and WARNED them that 10,000 other people have tried to shill garbage on WSB over the years and ALL have failed because all were bullshit and all cared more about making money via burning and churning the selling of a \u201cdream\u201d than actually providing ANY VALUE WHATSOEVER! u/jartek also stated to them that IF he found this to be the same that this would be a costly mistake for TTG as a company and they accepted.\n\nu/jartek\u2019s initial thoughts were cautiously optimistic and as time went by, he saw that not only was this not bullshit but it had real value!\n\nThe conversation of the WSB Championship came up and the idea that was floated around and what eventually was put into action was, TTG has committed to a substantial cash prize and WSB would introduce TTG to its community and ANY AND ALL SALES that came from that, WSB would receive 30% of the GROSS REVENUE and ALL 30% would be used for additional prize money for the event! WSB will make its money from ticket sales and PPV, NOT off of TTG sales!\n\nTrue Trading Group exists to help truly educate traders of all skill levels and types with regard to both stocks and options, to help them learn, trade and profit within a community of pro-traders and others like themselves. \n\nThe content TTG provides is not a \u201cget rich quick gimmick,\u201d it\u2019s legit. There are real lessons that are followed by exams, tons of exclusive video content, real-time DD tools which include filings, free analyst reports and soon, real-time LEVEL 2 via their partnership with QuoteMedia.\n\nRegardless, if you are just getting started with trading or you\u2019re an expert, TTG provides clear and concise education, profitable and transparent trade alerts and support to all members.\n\nu/jartek and I are now in the TTG chatroom daily to help welcome all members of WSB looking for a more educational and focused approach to trading stocks and options. \n\nBottom Line: We have done the research on TTG for 8 months and feel 100% comfortable allowing them to be our sponsor on this event. We hope that the WSB community can give it a fair try and then\u2026 provide real feedback for all. If you sign up for TTG and have a negative opinion you will NEVER be silenced. Comments will not be deleted because of negative opinions and they don\u2019t want that either. What they do want is constructive and real feedback to help add value to their members. \n\n**HOWEVER**\n\nThose who attempt to harm or discredit their business on anything that is not based on facts that can be proven will be BANNED! YOU have something negative to say? COOL say it\u2026 but back it up\u2026 and try and be constructive, this is not a huge ask from us\u2026 \n\nFor Those Who Are Open to Giving TTG a Chance Click the Link Below and Use Code \u201cWSBTTG\u201d to Save 30%\n\nClick Here: https://truetradinggroup.com/wallstreetbets/?cc=WSBTTG&amp;cp=30\n___\n- **The Future of WSB** \n\nWSB has been everyone\u2019s secret underground finance community where chaos flourishes and high-risk high-reward is the name of the game.\n\nIt is undeniable that the WSB community is growing at a very quick rate. That growth brings about change and we are aware that MOST people, including all of us, HATE CHANGE!\n\nHOWEVER\n\nWe will be transparent including you ALL as we grow and evolve in an effort to not lose touch with the members that have made this community what it is today. Far more important than any monetization effort or \u201cbusiness\u201d is the community of autists that have been here supporting us the whole time!\n\nThere will be no more ideas that are \u201csprung on you last minute or by surprise.\u201d We will include and discuss our growth strategies with you via the sub and Discord. THIS DOES NOT MEAN EVERYONE GETS A VOTE but it DOES MEAN WE WILL CONSIDER ALL FEEDBACK AS WE GROW. \n___\nONE LAST THING:\n\nIn addition to the above issues which we have addressed at length in this thread, there are other \u201cissues\u201d such as conspiracy theories and rumors. What we have to say on this will be kept brief because all of it is asinine and it\u2019s not worth a large response, here you go:\n\n- EVERY SINGLE DETAIL about jartek, his family, anything about MJ Stocks is a fascinating but 100% FICTION. Although we were all impressed and frankly a bit afraid that someone took the time to put so much effort into what is 100% a troll\u2026 but \u201cA\u201d for effort\u2026 lol\n\nGoing Forward On this Topic:\n\n- If you are a part of the WSB community and want to see it move forward in a way that works for everyone, you won\u2019t be spreading FALSE information or doxing ANYONE! Those that do will be banned immediately.\n\n- If you have a question, NO MATTER what the topic about, anything regarding the WSB or those that run it, etc\u2026 PLEASE feel free to ask. YOU will never be banned for asking something straight up.\n___\nIN CLOSING:\n\nWe encourage all of you to now ask us anything and we will respond to as many questions as we can, honestly.",

        "selftext": "Jk, it\u2019s going to go down.\n\nFor those retards that have been here since 2018, you\u2019ll recall that I called for a V shape rebound in the December China growth scare sell off. I\u2019m usually a big fat bull (see flair), but I have to be realistic given the landscape.\n\nThe market will have a big pivot this week on Monday to trigger a new down move. Why?\n\n1. Market is out of steam - Thursday should have been much higher following the fed announcement. One of the largest packages in history met with a whimper +1.5% when the VIX is north of 40. What does that mean? At these levels, government support is, say it with me, PRICED IN. Yes, jobless claims numbers were bad but that was known.\n\n2. Banks announce next week, and the commentary will be awful - Look, everyone knows Q2 outlook will be shit except a lucky few (amzn, zoom, cost, etc.). Management is growing to throw everything and the kitchen sink because they have a free pass this quarter. However, the reality is they don\u2019t have visibility into later in the year, let along 2021. Who is going to stick their neck out and not speak grim death with unemployment rising to 20%? Earnings is where the rubber meets the road when all the macro/emotion driven swings subside, and the reality is no one can say with confidence what the E in PE will be going forward.\n\n3. Followup to point #2. Consensus numbers from Wall Street are literally retarded. 5% earnings decline in 2020 with a rebound to $170 on the SPX in 2021. I know the market expectations are for a worse 2020, but consensus is for 2021 to exceed 2019. Show me another recession, let alone one this sharp, rebounds like that. You think animal spirits of 2019 will be back later this year after all this? It\u2019s risk off and gradual rebuild for several years. 80% of layoffs / furloughs outside of effected industries will be permanent. Effected industries will downsize as well. Main Street businesses and consumers are wiped out. Risk off, everywhere.\n\nCould I be wrong? No, I can\u2019t. We\u2019re drilling on Monday after a higher open, bookmark this.\n\nFor you retards who were stubborn enough to hold your puts 3 weeks too early, congrats you finally made it to the other side.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it. \n\nIt's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.\n\n\\- ALPHABET -A-. Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks. \n\n\\- ARISTA NETWORKS. Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.\n\n\\- FACEBOOK. This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy. \n\n\\- GALAPAGOS. To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences. \n\n\\- INCYTE GENOMICS. Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%\n\n\\- LULULEMON ATHLETICA. Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase. \n\n\\- MASTERCARD. Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.\n\n\\- MICROSOFT. No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices. \n\n\\- NVIDIA. Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars. \n\n\\- VEEVA SYSTEMS. One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.\n\nOne last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.\n\nHope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!\n\nTL;DR. Stonks only go up.",

        "selftext": "Ok so a lot of you have to be sitting here wondering why the fuck this market refuses to go down, why your tendies are burnt, etc. Well I want to kind of try and take a second to explain how I see things here from a macro and micro, and why I think the rug pull is coming on this bear market rally very soon.\n\nLet's start by going macro a bit.\n\n**Phase 1**\n\nFor many, when the virus hit the ferociousness at which it gripped not only the markets but society as a whole caught a lot of people flat footed - like Ray Dalio's fund ( [https://www.ft.com/content/6addc002-6666-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3](https://www.ft.com/content/6addc002-6666-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3) ).\n\nThe market turned so quickly and violently as people rushed to sell everything that it created massive losses for the funds... thats right this is where we get to some brrrrrrrr'ing.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\nWhen we look at the reversal its a violent short squeeze due in part to fed liquidity action and the impact on balance sheets for big companies.\n\nBasically they came in hard with the liquidity from the Fed, which was in the form of the corporate bond debt that they bought up. (See late march run ups in the corporate bonds market - $LQD) What few retail investors (fuck I learned this myself a few weeks back) realize is that companies like Apple, for example, who have a shit ton of \"cash\" on there balance sheet actually oftentimes have a balance of both cash and corporate debt ( [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/why-apple-sold-debt-despite-having-lots-of-cash-2019-9-1028503164](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/why-apple-sold-debt-despite-having-lots-of-cash-2019-9-1028503164) ), and its not just corporates that own these assets - hedge funds do too. This is what is traded with things like LQD. When the Fed stepped in they revved the fuck up on that printer just buying all that debt from any fucking seller that existed. This caused LQD to moon, and injected a fuck load more cash into the market which is where phase two of this craziness begins, when market sentiment peaked on the panic side, they pushed in hard, and forced a MASSIVE up bound short squeeze. Important to note that options volume has been down since that quad witching, but that's somewhat normal. Interesting as well is how \"orderly\" this movement has seemed, both suppressing VIX while jumping 20% from the lows... an important number for....\n\n**Phase 3 - Reality Rug Pull**\n\nNow, you might have noticed that some of those same managers that have helped push us up to this close have started getting a lot more bearish (i.e. realistic) with their statements, folks like Janet Yellen and Jamie Dimon calling this a massive recession and possible depression just this week (Actually Ray Dalio just came out and called it \"The Great Depression\" as well -  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandrasternlicht/2020/04/08/ray-dalio-were-heading-into-a-great-depression/#71cbd2a97c83](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandrasternlicht/2020/04/08/ray-dalio-were-heading-into-a-great-depression/#71cbd2a97c83) ). Consensus has shifted to a -30% 2Q GDP, meanwhile they are waiving a red curtain at the market frothing it up.\n\n*Today they got RIGHT where they wanted, a 20% retracement from the lows - i.e. a technical bull market.*\n\nNow this leads to the rug pull.\n\n*Lets dive in micro*\n\nToday was especially low volume actually.  In fact it was the lowest volume day since March 5 on the NYSE ([https://twitter.com/hmeisler/status/1247992863780208640?s=20](https://twitter.com/hmeisler/status/1247992863780208640?s=20)) Part of this is because the market is waiting on a couple of news pieces, yes. But mainly they are leveraging this week which is the one week reprieve in earnings reports to top off their long returns from the dip before this upcoming rug pull.\n\n**Some Brief Amateur TA**\n\nI'm by no means a pro analyst here but I took a stab at analyzing what's going on here:\n\nImportant notes from today:\n\n1. We challenged, unsuccessfully at close, the shooting star pattern established yesterday. If we had closed above the high, we would be still aiming bullish in the short run.\n2. Tomorrow and this weekend are critical.\n\nAs you can see we are approaching the intersection channel here between the simple lows and highs trend lines on the 180 day chart. Likely if we finish to the downside of that yellow line when they cross, we are good and should begin the technical down turn, which may not be super sharp but should exceed the lows as we continue through Q2.\n\nOne very intriguing note. Take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/cbd5NRH). That's yesterday's daily candle, which formed a potential shooting star.\n\nSome of you may have seen some talk about how yesterday (4/7) the daily chart showed a rare pattern known as a shooting star. Basically we needed to close below yesterday to fully confirm it, but instead we closed just below the previous high - which actually doesn't invalidate the bearish pattern. How narrowly did we avoid closing over? By about 15 minutes.\n\n*Now* [Look at the 1m charts from today's close.](https://imgur.com/F8aMNXe) See the high candle? Look familiar? Today in the 1m charts we **technically** did have a completed shooting star that you can see pushed us down.\n\nNow take a quick look at the [RSI on a 15 day scale](https://imgur.com/KlCQrtO). As you can see we are topping into over bought territory... again right at the 20% technical bull market retracement. The water is frothy and that's just how the MM want it.\n\nThe Rug pull will have likely they are waiting on either (a) something like Boris dying to push the market sentiment down or (b) a final run up (maybe, and small) on the OPEC news tomorrow back to 275-280 before pulling the rug.\n\n*If I could wager a guess, I believe that we see a really big sell off into the long weekend, and provided we don't come up with a cure over it or have some other excessively large amount of good news*\n\n*Next week the market cannot hide from reality. Earnings reports for Q1 begin to be released, including Delta Airlines, which will be viewed as a bellweather in this market - especially after Buffet sold his stake. The blood will be in the water. I see two ways for it to play out from there either a slow bleed to the new lows like 2008, or we violently snap back down as the market stops being able to run from the economic realities at hand.*\n\n**TL;DR -** The market has been squeezing you dry for the last few weeks, this is NOT a bull market now - thinking so is just recency bias. All the forces add up to this run being an epic short squeeze followed by an epic rug pull reversal. This is fake liquidity that has propped the market up. HOLD YOUR PUTS, roll them back as we go down.\n\nSPY 210p 6/19\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: OH!** One really important bit! Ha - I think that OPEC+ is likely priced in as far as the big money is concerned. Essentially the amount of cuts discussed don't do too much to ease the fact that demand is zilch - theres oversupply right now and there will be even with a production cut. We have been expecting this for weeks, its a moving target. I genuinely think as well theres a chance the Saudis say fuck you and decide to curb stomp US shale but thats a whole 'nother thing.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nOh well would you look at that! Bloomberg now has us at 100% chance of recession. https://twitter.com/davidinglestv/status/1248020033155952641?s=21",

But if, you are here and looking for a sustainable way to generate cash, keep reading.**\n\nFirst, There isn't any good in being perma bears or bulls that is so fucking stupid the only gang that you want to join is **PRINTING GANG**.\n\nSecond, This is what I made today [+1,193.36](https://i.imgur.com/zPHP6fv.jpg), you see how I only make 1 trade? I don't see any entry point so I didn't do anything all day, Sometime BEST POSITION IS NO POSITION and This year so far [+$425,443.23](https://i.imgur.com/AJpVbm1.png) which on average I made 3.42% per trade so **DON'T GET FUCKING GREEDY** and **TAKE THE MOTHERFUCKING PROFIT**. Not every trade is a win, you can't win them all but if you can make 3.5% per trade and you do that 20 times in a day. You will double your initial money. I did that many times [Sample 1](https://i.imgur.com/4bAg7BQ.jpg) [Sample 2] (https://i.imgur.com/4RsOUtZ.jpg).\n\nThird, During high VIX time. The only 2 ways to make money which either YOU SELL THE OPTIONS or YOU DAY TRADE. If you don't have $25k then I'm sorry this game is not for you.\n\nFourth, I have day traded options for about 14 years since I was 22. Right now the market is **ONCE IN A LIFETIME** opportunity. Like my man EMINEM once said *\"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity, To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment, Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo\"* so don't let it fucking slip.\n\n**DO**\n\n - Get in and get out don't be fucking greedy.\n - Have an entry and exit price in mind before you open the fucking trade. So learn how to cut losses and take the profit.\n - If you made a bad trade. Get the fuck out, cut losses and try again, Don't fucking bagholding it and pray. God is not real. Santa is also not real.\n - Learn your greeks if you don't know what it is just fucking BING IT.\n - Once you have closed your position. Just fucking forget about it. Don't look back. Move on to the next trade. HINDSIGT IS ALWAYS 20/20.\n - Keep in your mind that if you trading options without any underlying then you are **GAMBLING**. This is not investing and stop calling your bankroll \"portfolio\".\n - If you are degenerate gambler like me this is what I do with my bankroll. I put whatever I feel comfortable losing in my trading account. The rest I keep in my checking account (separate institution). So when my retard brain tell me to do stupid shit, I don't lost it all. By the time I need to move more money into my bankroll, my head will be cleared (hopefully) and stop doing stupid shit.\n\n**DON'T**\n\n - **DON'T GAMBLE MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE** It's sad that I have to say this. Use the fucking money on important first, rent, mortgage, car payment, food, etc.\n - DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT be **H**orrified **O**f **M**issing **O**ut. Just remember that it is better making no money than losing money so assess the market before make a fucking trade.\n - Don't fucking all in, this is not a world poker series. There is no such a thing as a sure trade.\n - Don't take any DD with face vaule. DO YOUR OWN FUCKING RESEARCH. DD on here is just your starting point. It stands for DUE DILIGENCE for christ sake not DONE DEAL.\n - If you win on one trade. It is already your money. Don't use your tard brain and think that now you are gambling with a house money.\n - Don't be a MONEY HATER person. Let's say your position drop 50%, assess it. Imagine that if you have the money now, Would you get in to this position at this market price. If the answer is no, then cut the loss and exit the position. **IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU PAID FOR IT** What matter is what it will be in the future.\n - Stop using fucking robinhood and use any real broker. I use Charlie's most of my trading friend use IBKR\n - Don't be fucking poor go find $25,000 and day trade if you don't have $25,000 then go live your live until you have it.\n\n\n**THE BS**\n\n - Yeah you head it before \"Scared money don't make no money\" but what if I tell you \"Stupid money also don't make no money\" So please DD before you get in any position.\n - **DIAMOND HAND** is fucking **STUPID** concept. Get that out of your system, STAT! If you think your position will loss value and you will just diamond hand through it, don't you dumb fuck. Just sell and buy back when it is cheaper!\n - NOONE fucking knows where the market will go. I repeat NOONE! So don't fucking fall for the scam.\n - TA is standing for Technical Astrology so if you need a book I recommend [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Only-Astrology-Book-Youll-Ever-ebook/dp/B00578T33K/ref=sr_1_3?crid=L0R6GAADG2J8&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=astrology+for+beginners&amp;qid=1586368924&amp;sprefix=astrology+for+beg%2Caps%2C194&amp;sr=8-3).\n - What goes up might not come down. What went down might not come up. YES I AM TALKING TO YOU JNUGGER!\n\n**FAQ**\n\nDo you use stop loss and profit exit?\n\n - Yes, Stop at 7% and exit at 5% but most of the time I exit or cut loss before it hits. Except for the position I open at EOD.\n\nWhat indicator do you use?\n\n - Macro economic news and trade from experience (ie just wing it). I DON'T USE TA.

        "selftext": "Now more than ever, banks, hedge funds, fudge packers, brokers, you name it, is leveraged beyond belief. All of them are autists buying everything they can on margin to make bank bro, and they don\u2019t want to hold any cash because it\u2019s not printing tendies. So they buy bonds, treasuries, etc. to print them small returns instead of holding cash. They are illiquid as hell. \n\nWhen the market crashed, a lot of these guys, specifically hedge funds, got caught with their smelly panties down and were at risk of getting margin called or did get margin called and the whole fucking thing was about to crash down. The market would have went down another 25%. They had no cash and the repo market had no demand, because any cash that people did have, no one wanted to lend it out because the economy was fucked (still is). In short, think of a repo as when a hedge fund wants cash real quick to buy a call option on Tesla but all their cash is tied up in other equities. So they put the treasury bonds or any other securities on the repo market and they get cold hard cash through a repurchase agreement and make bank on their Tesla call and then give the money back to the issuer of the cash, plus interest. \n\nSo now, JP said how do I stop this free fall and get the markets back in order. I bring back demand for the repo market so hedge funds can get liquid again and start buying up equities with options and make a fuckin killing while all of us cheer on our girlfriends getting railed by their boyfriends, and cry about the lack of tendies from our puts. \n\nSo JP started injecting trillions into the repo market and hedge funds lended out their securities for loads on cold hard cash, bought equities hand over fist, and stopped the market free fall while making a shit load of money on the rebound. Win-win, the fed stopped the bleeding and got paid back on their loan because the hedge funds made bank on the bounce, and a win to the hedge funds because they were saved again from defaulting and now have cash (reserves) to play with and make even more tendies. \n\nSo JP stopped arguably the biggest leveraged/default crash we have ever seen next to the housing crisis overnight by directly engaging in repurchase agreements with hedge funds. Hedge funds/Pension Funds drive the market. \n\nNow that hedge funds are liquid again, they will soon start closing their long positions and go short, because let\u2019s be real, the economy is fucked beyond belief right now and hedge funds are in the business of making lots of tendies. Not much more room to go up, but plenty to go down. JP only stepped in to avoid the banks and hedge funds getting fucked, and once banks are fucked, no one gets any more loans and we all eat shit. Now that those dealers are liquid again, the markets should start to play out as they should when you have 17M unemployed in 3x weeks, no consumer activity, corporations maxing out credit lines about to issue stock at depressed values, and US oil going bankrupt. \n\nSo, hang on to those puts. Hedge funds love making bank bro, and the fastest way to do that is playing the downside. As long as the dealers (banks, hedge funds) don\u2019t get too leveraged again and have access to cash, then JP is going to have to watch the market slow bleed. \n\nNotice on Wednesday/Thursday we started to see some major drops and selling. That is hedge funds taking billions in profits and ready to reverse course for utter destruction. Next week we start the fall. You can count on it.",

        "selftext": "I've called 3 major reversals and 1 short term one last week (check my post history) and I'm here to tell you we might be in for another major reversal.\n\nPrice has attempted, three times, to break resistance at SPY 264. 264 is a super significant number, and it's very typical for price to get stuck at a significant number and reverse at said super significant number.\n\nFirst, $264 is the 200 Week moving average. The 200 week moving average has been support for this entire bull market - 9 fucking years!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qe68eao0jbr41.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2640b176655d0341604e956532613eed2af27490\n\nSecond, it's the .382 Fib of the entire price decline from the all time high. The two line up perfectly. When a structural support and a major fib line up, it's like wearing two condoms during gay sex - little jimmy has to work way harder to impregnate your boyfriend's sister's husband.\n\n![img](7od46vbjibr41 \"Second, it's the .382 Fib of this entire decline.\n\")\n\nNow look at the price action: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6be97modjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ddf004701b380f9f67e8ec6f3797dea975dd4a\n\nIn a bull market, this would be hella bullish price action - price banging on the door, eventually breaking it down. But we're not in a bull market are we? Hellllll no we're not.\n\nIn a bull market, an impulse gap like the one we had this morning above a previous short term trend of the previous move (see the red line drawn from the ATH) would be on high volume.\n\nCheck out this pitiful volume today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwkoouzxjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e55cad6e16a52e32f68c14a581211ce8222f05d0\n\nJust sad, sad volume for a gap impulse.\n\nFinally, factor in where we closed. RIGHT at the 200 weekly MA. Not above it. the final minute saw HUGE sell volumes into the close. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v71xmxsbkbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a134ebbc82de1050f2cd145df0e8dacb25a577\n\nNow look, I'm not saying price can't continue up further. It absolutely could. There have been enormous short positioned established in the past two weeks which will put upward pressure on prices and could carry price to $270-280 if we break above $264 with high volume.\n\nBUT, if we fail here for the THIRD time. The selling is going to be absolutely vicious. 20 day realized volatility is 100. ONE FUCKING HUNDRED. UNFUCKING PRECEDENTED. The VIX is currently at 43 after a 7% SPY move. These are unfuckingprecedented times people.\n\nLike all TA gays, I'm here to tell you that price could go up, but there's an absolutely beautiful technical setup for a massive implosion.",

        "selftext": "Greetings my fellow clan of delinquent compatriots. I made a post 3 weeks ago regarding how to avoid IV crush during this recent market rally. The link to that can be found here: [Don't Scream \"GUH\", Avoid IV Crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmshcv/when_market_bounce_inevitably_comesdont_scream/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). That trade worked out well, and I am back. \n\nToday, I am back with a follow-up for navigating the road ahead. **This post is not about** ***why*** **the market will potentially retest the lows, but rather** ***how*** **to maximize profit and limit downside risk should the move down occur.** Just as the vega-neutral post focused on volatility trades, this one explores vol strategies further. I tried to substitute words with pictures for the illiterate inclined. \n\nFor solid DD on where the market is going, view u/Variation-Separate or u/scarvesandsuspenders recent posts. I do believe that sitting at either the 50% or potential near term 61.8% retracement will trigger the next leg down, and this post is about how to capitalize on that through volatility. \n\n**At best, you will get a trade idea (other than $SPY puts / $SPY straddles). At worst, you will gain some solid understanding of volatility and how it applies to you. My goal in this post is to take a pretty abstract concept and break it down so that we can all become more profitable.** Take 5 minutes, read, challenge my strategy, ask questions, and achieve nirvana. Let's begin. \n\n**So You Say I Should Trade Volatility, Aye:**\n\nYes. That is exactly what I am saying. While retail traders and WSBers have been yoloing FD on TSLA and SPCE (Jan 2022 calls will print), smart money has been executing the best trade of the past decade. The trade: **Short volatility, hedged with volatility insurance.** This is done by shorting $VXX (short vol), and purchasing $VIX calls (long vol) on a rolling basis as a hedge. Depending on the time frame of your $VIX calls (weekly, quarterly, monthly), this trade has performed dramatically well. \n\nThe strategy is rooted in the belief that volatility will, over time, mean revert and decrease after spikes caused by a \"black swan.\" It is logical - option premiums on the S&amp;P 500 (for which the $VIX tracks) theoretically will never remain permanently inflated as news becomes digested. Take a look at 2008, 2000, etc - the common theme is volatility starts to **slowly** recede before the lows of the S&amp;P 500 are registered as the catalyst causes an explosion of volatility, and as the market prices in the \"black swan,\" the market naturally performs price discovery causing volatility to come down. That is not to say volatility does not continue to spike during draw-downs in equities - it does, but typically not as dramatically unless the incoming news is categorized as dramatically more significant.\n\n* u/stonksgodown made a post regarding this phenomenon, but omitted some key factors and made some bold assumptions that I wanted to counter / elaborate on.\n\n**Realized Volatility verse Implied Volatility:**\n\nImplied volatility for the broader market can be understood through $VIX. IV is forward looking, and gives us an understanding of how much the market is expecting to move over the next 30-day period (this is a simplification, but applies). Realized volatility is actual variance in price movement over a period in time. To compare the two, solve for the realized volatility over the past 30 day period (21 trading days) by taking the standard deviation, adjusted for an annualized reading. I calculated this to get updated data, and the current output is below:\n\n[RV \\/ IV 2020](https://preview.redd.it/35274i2e4as41.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=373e3068f8df94f6e4b65be3a692bd5e1c02e40a)\n\nWhat we can see is that a pretty stark divergence has occurred, with realized vol moving higher than implied vol. This negative spread relationship is counter-intuitive. Think about it. **If IV is forward looking, it should be trading at a premium to where RV is currently trading at because we need to account for the uncertainty in the future variance of the markets.** \n\nThis is not the first time this has happened. It occurred in 2002, in 2008, and in a few periods of high volatility since the GFC. \n\n[RV \\/ IV 2008](https://preview.redd.it/ujrsn6wh4as41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3692b766c961835a5f85953643181f87d8907ae)\n\n[RV \\/ IV Collection](https://preview.redd.it/lfgm3wfj4as41.png?width=669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=316882d12d5ddaebf7eb0a59480e648999aec947)\n\nThe important theme is that, over time, the relationship eventually returns to normalcy. That is, overtime either realized vol decreases, implied vol increases, or a combination of the two occurs. This is where our previous author went astray by saying this divergence requires a spike in IV - there are many ways for this imbalance to revert to normalcy. \n\nWhen RV is below IV, the market is understating the risk of a large loss. When RV is above IV, the market is clearly in distress, and it is overstating the risk of a large loss. **Put simply: RV &gt; IV, the market favors option buyers, RV &lt; IV, the market favors option sellers.** \n\nThis is huge, because it clearly articulates the opportunity cost of purchasing verse selling options. But as I highlighted before, the return to a positive IV / RV spread can occur with a decrease in RV, an increase in IV, or a combination of the two, and the time frame is murky. So, Master Skywalker, what are we going to do?\n\nLet's take a look at the $VIX futures because they can show us what the market is forecasting for expected future movement of $SPX option implied volatility. The term structure for the $VIX futures is showing mad backwardation - that is, the future settlement dates are trading well below the current spot price. In WSB terms, the futures market is implying $VIX will continue to fall over the next 8 months.\n\n[$VIX Futures Term Structure](https://preview.redd.it/1xbj1x1m6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcb4ea8ff11c7221b9166885571b1c5f112ee503)\n\n**The Volatility Trade, Applied Right Now:**\n\nWe are presented with 3 potential outcomes:\n\n* Realized Vol Decreases (requires $VIX to decrease or trade narrowly)\n* Implied Vol Increases\n* A combination of the two over time (most likely outcome)\n\nThe issue is - Realized Vol has already happened, so how do we speculate on this? By using a similar concept to a reverse calendar spread. **The trade:** \n\nShort $VIX Futures with Settlement for Sept 2020 ($VXU20) - **Bet that RV Decreases Over 5 Month Period**\n\n* Or just short $VXX\n\nLong $VIX calls: $VIX call, 45 strike, $3.90 ask, expiring 6/17/20 - **Bet that IV Increases Over 2 Month Period**\n\nNote: I recognize that most of you do not have access to futures or even shorting for that matter, which is why I will also present a solid hybrid trade, but hear me out.\n\nWhat this does: $VIX futures with further settlement dates, while less liquid, are less sensitive to short-term spikes in the $VIX. This trade is a bet that implied volatility through September will be decreasing in aggregate. The $VIX calls with short-term settlement dates are implemented to hedge my short $VIX futures, and capitalize on any potential increase in IV moving forward should we retest the lows in $SPY. **This trade let's me bet on a short-term decrease in $SPY (and related spike in $VIX), while hedging with a longer-term bet that volatility will decrease.** It is essentially a volatility strangle with different time frames. This requires margin, and excess cash in case of margin call :)\n\n**How a Newb With a Robinhood Account Can Do This:**\n\nThe simple newb approach would be a reverse calendar spread (sell long dated calls, buy short-date calls) on $VXX, but that caps our gains, and we are not here for capped gains. If you are, jump over to r/investing.\n\nI recognize that RH does not allow $VIX, let alone $VIX futures. So let's reassess the goal of this trade: We expect $SPY to retest the lows, volatility to spike in the short-term, and I want tendies to print because of this. This movement should work toward restoring a positive relationship between RV and IV. But, maybe you, like me, have cautious conviction about this trade given the Fed, US Gov stimulus, and other erroneous factors. So, with the goal of maximizing gains, and limiting losses, we are going to hedge our exposure.\n\n**The Hypothetical Hedged Vol Trade:**\n\n* Long $SVXY (inverse volatility ETP) - inverse vol AKA $VIX go down, profit go up - **Short Vol Leg**\n* Long $VXX calls, $VIX calls , or even $SVXY puts if you really wanted to - **Long Vol Leg**\n   * Can adjust the weightings to amplify exposure to short-term volatility, i.e. for every 100 shares of $SVXY on the short vol leg, purchase 2 option contracts on the long vol leg. Find a combination that satisfies your risk tolerance. Note: $SVXY tracks -0.5x the performance of short-term $VIX futures ($SPVXSP). \n* You can also just do volatility straddles / strangles, but the issue is decreasing vol tends to move very slowly, which is why avoiding theta option decay on the short vol leg is very important.\n* **Hedging is for Pussies!** If this is you - fear not, you have some options, but if you're wrong, it is really gonna hurt. \n* $SVXY Puts\n* $VXX Calls / $VIX Calls\n* $SPY Puts\n* $SPY straddle / strangle - risk IV crush, narrow trading range, theta decay etc. \n* **Note: These are just trade strategies. These are not recommendations, and many combinations of the aforementioned products can be utilized, but be sure to understand what you are investing in.** \n\nIn this scenario, we are going long $SVXY (short vol) to capture the pullback in RV overtime, and we are long $VXX calls to capture the short-term increase in IV, and to hedge our short vol exposure. **What you just did is capture really good upside opportunity while hedging away downside risk, and eliminate the chance of blowing up your account.** The reason we are hedging our long vol is because the RV / IV relationship is imbalanced, but that does not mean we are guaranteed higher IV in the short-term.\n\n**tl;dr - I expect the market to move in the direction of retesting the lows, but Fed bailout, Fiscal stimulus, and overall complacency could prevent a retest. Thus, instead of trading $SPY, consider trading volatility as the relationship between realized vol and implied vol is fucked up, and will correct itself over time. Because of this, explore going short volatility while hedging with long volatility call options. Long $SVXY, Long $VXX Calls.**\n\nAs always, discuss, challenge, ask questions and shitpost!\n\n- \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc36",

REUTERS/Remo Casilli\nIMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva painted a far bleaker picture of the social and economic impact of the new coronavirus than even a few weeks ago, noting governments had already undertaken fiscal stimulus measures of $8 trillion, but more would likely be needed.\n\nShe said the crisis would hit emerging markets and developing countries hardest of all, which would then need hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid.\n\n\u201cJust three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020,\u201d she said on Thursday in remarks prepared for delivery ahead of next week\u2019s IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings.\n\n\u201cToday, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.\u201d\n\nIf the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, the IMF expected a partial recovery in 2021, Georgieva said, but she warned the situation could also get worse.\n\n\u201cI stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook: it could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic,\u201d she said.\n\nThe IMF, which has 189 member countries, will release its detailed World Economic Outlook forecasts on Tuesday.\n\nThe novel coronavirus that emerged in China in December has raced around the globe, infecting 1.41 million people and killing 83,400, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nGeorgieva said the pandemic was hitting both rich and poor countries, but many in Africa, Asia and Latin America were at higher risk because they had weaker health systems. They were also unable to implement social distancing in their densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums.\n\nShe said investors had already removed some $100 billion in capital from those economies, more than three times the outflow seen during the same period of the global financial crisis.\n\nWith commodity prices down sharply, emerging market and developing countries would need trillions of dollars to fight the pandemic and rescue their economies, she said.\n\n\u201cThey urgently need help,\u201d she said, estimating hundreds of billions of dollars would have to be pumped in from outside sources since those governments could only cover a portion of the costs on their own, and many already had high debts.\n\nGeorgieva said it was encouraging that all governments had sprung into action, enacting some $8 trillion in fiscal measures and massive monetary measures.\n\nTo ensure a future recovery, Georgieva called for continued efforts to contain the virus and support health systems, while averting export controls that could slow the flow of vital medical equipment and food.\n\n\u201cThe actions we take now will determine the speed and strength of our recovery,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was critical to provide affected people and companies with \u201clarge, timely and targeted\u201d measures such as wage subsidies, extended unemployment benefits and adjusted loan terms, while reducing stress to the financial system.\n\nCoordinated fiscal stimulus was critical, and monetary policy should remain accommodative, where inflation remained low.\n\n\u201cThose with greater resources and policy space will need to do more; others, with limited resources will need more support,\u201d she said.\n\nThe IMF was created for times like these, and stood ready to deploy its $1 trillion in lending capacity, Georgieva said.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s executive board had approved doubling its emergency funding to $100 billion to meet the requests of over 90 countries, and staff were racing to process those requests.\n\nThe IMF was also looking at ways to provide additional liquidity support, including through creation of a new short-term liquidity line, and solutions that would allow lending even to countries whose debt was unsustainable, she said.\n\nThe IMF was also looking to increase its Catastrophe Relief and Containment Fund, which provides grants for the poorest countries to cover IMF debt service payments, to $1.4 billion from around $200 million, she said.\n\nTo further aid the poorest economies, the Fund and the World Bank were urging creditors such as China and other countries to temporarily stop collecting debt payments on their bilateral loans.",

        "selftext": "Alright, my bad everyone. This last post was really lazy, and I realize that I had nothing in there this morning after waking up, and seeing 43 comments making fun of a shitpost I labeled as DD.\n\n#LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN\n\nThe initial post had one image in it, and it was apparently only after that it showed no actual information.\n\n[Here's the full image](https://i.imgur.com/NJ6gs2r.png) - It's SPY, on the one day, and we're focusing on the apparent downturn on Friday.\n\nThe reason I'm saying this is going to be a downturn, is because this sentiment is shared with multiple other stocks in the S&amp;P and elsewhere:\n\n[Here's AMD in the same time period with no settings changed.](https://i.imgur.com/lSDnSmv.png) It appears further along in its downturn.\n\n[Here's Visa with the same downturn potential.](https://i.imgur.com/BjVeGPA.png)\n\n[Here's Microsoft](https://i.imgur.com/SK0YdlV.png)\n\n[Here's Apple](https://i.imgur.com/0BFDaR2.png)\n\n[Here's GM](https://i.imgur.com/bwoVCcW.png)\n\n[Here's JPM](https://i.imgur.com/YoY0QNK.png)\n\n[Here's GS](https://i.imgur.com/r6Jqjc4.png)\n\nWhat originally got me taking a look at this is the gobs macking nature of the market, and the \"how could this possibly be up right now\" ideation which everyone has. I started taking a look at downward trends, and tried it from a week out. The key answer is: It's not. On a weekly basis, the market sentiment [is absolutely down, and appears to be falling like a rock](https://i.imgur.com/FjQST1e.png)\n\nThere's nothing really substantial about the MACD settings I have in here. They're a little more sensitive close in, and I prefer over Wilders because It seems to better predict significant movements.\n\n[When drawing support lines](https://i.imgur.com/jwbMUc4.png), taking into account the high, and moving toward the low with the opposite channel, there's a definitive direction taking place. The lower bollinger is midway through the channel, with the low indicating SPY ~190.\n\n[The four hour MACD has already crossed as of Tuesday (May 31st)](https://i.imgur.com/jPURern.png), and once the daily follows, which I am presuming it will, things are going to go down significantly. I'm envisioning an opposite reaction with at least the same force as the [bull trap which was set up here.](https://i.imgur.com/Ktmgr6v.png)\n\nTaking a look at the scale, and time on the daily, it appears that by next Friday, SPY is going to be following its 4 hour downward. It could be even closer if the oil talks do not go well. If they do, this sentiment may be pushed off until the following week.\n\nI do not recommend anybody hold calls for outside next week. I do not recommend that anyone hold stocks past next week, unless they're bull ETFs.\n\nTo explain my sentiment, we're seeing decreasing volume on most stocks. I presume this is because everyone is of the same mind: this bull trend doesn't make sense. We're going to see more COVID deaths, company production is halted, and nothing is being manufactured. There's no way for cash injections to buoy a market which is literally producing nothing. Further, the price of oil will not either. The weekly sentiment is strong down, the 4 hour is peaking down, and this is across the board on all the stocks I've listed above. SPY will eventually follow the separate stock trends, and we're going to see some amazing losses.\n\nSuggested positions:\n\n   * [AAPL - 180p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/pYKw3fD.png)\n   * [AMD - 30p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/IIZYdVp.png)\n   * [JPM - 50p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/z5DzliZ.png)\n   * [SNE - 44p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/KEBLC4Z.png)\n   * [SPY - fuck, I dunno. Maybe 190p, but 180p maybe too - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/dtMWnZm.png)\n   * [DIS - 70p? 65p? 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/PMU1DfA.png)\n   * [YUM - 40p/35p 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/3T4OKS6.png)\n   * [ALLY - they're fucked. I dunno. 6p, 4p - 15 may?](https://i.imgur.com/70ojmh9.png)\n   * [C - 15p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/W4cqqaQ.png)\n   * [GS - 100p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/3k2IW9G.png)\n\n\nOn Ally - they're probably going to go bankrupt. Most of their business is auto loan servicing, something no one has any interest in paying when they're going to need food and need to pay rent. Further, the federal government has had no discussions about auto loan bailouts. I looked into their 10k which was released in Feb, and 5/6ths of their loans are for cars. Further, 40% of those loans were made to people with a sub-700 credit rating. They have been getting into the mortgage game, but it's a modicum of their portfolio. I don't think they're making it out of this year alive.\n\nWe're seeing a pattern here right? All of those images above - The sentiment across the market is clear: we're plumbing depths, and you almost can't fuck this up. Buy a put, make sure the strike price makes sense a little bit, and get. dat. cash.",

        "selftext": "The bottom (so far). Clearly, I fucked up pretty badly. I knew the playbook: don\u2019t sell during a panic. I did the one thing that I was certain I shouldn\u2019t have done. Consequently, I took a few days to take a step back and analyzed why I didn\u2019t follow the 1-step process of not opening your brokerage account. \n\nUp until March 23rd, I held Vanguard targeted date funds and DCA\u2019d. I wasn\u2019t worried that the world was going to end, and I genuinely believed we\u2019ll be back to full steam in 2-3 years. The reason I sold was because that was the point when I internalized that the fund was a mishmash of everything. Still, I was holding a bunch of companies and sectors that I believe would stagnate/collapse in the next 10-20 years. It just didn\u2019t sit right with me. Regardless of the countless evidence pointing towards indices being the best for investors, I just cannot reconcile with that fact. There will always be a voice in my head telling me to sell. I realized that the only way I could hold through crises is by actively choosing what was going to be in my portfolio. \n\nIs that a personal failure not following the data? Maybe. Can I beat the indices? Certainly not with day/swing trading. However, over a longer time frame, I think I have a good shot. \n\nI just wanted to share this with other people. This sub\u2019s version of loss porn if you will.  Fuck that was a lot of money.\n\nPS: one thing I wanted to address on the side. People often talk about how there are these huge teams of analysts from Ivy League schools with PhDs and what not, hence it is impossible to beat them. I disagree with that statement. I went to school with many of them - including the PhD part - and I\u2019ve worked with a few companies who have hired them for their services. They are far, far, far from infallible.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: Your long-dated puts will print. Just don't dance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow many Americans do you think are currently infected with SARS-CoV-2? How many Americans do you think will die? Write your answers down, this isn't China, no bullshitting.\n\nTrump's estimation of 200,000 deaths with a peak in mid-April is almost certainly an underestimate. Information based on \"confirmed cases\" is a load of crap from both intentional and unintentional undertesting. There is however data that is relatively immune to fake news: deaths. The US is currently at 4,053 deaths. From this simple, clear data we can construct several hypotheses about how the illness will progress.\n\n**In this model, I will use three primary data inputs with low uncertainty to show you just how bad things are about to get.**\n\n1. The time series of US deaths. NB: I used that data available yesterday and have not added yesterday's 912 new deaths. Source: [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)\n2. A case fatality rate of 1%. This data comes from cruise ships where 100% of passengers were tested. This data is the best we have on case fatality, although the total numbers of infected are low enough to make this the largest source of model uncertainty. I also completely ignore the effect of overwhelmed hospitals in this analysis, if, as is likely, overwhelmed medical systems cause the case fatality rate to rise to WHO's 3.4%, things will be much worse. Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020\\_coronavirus\\_pandemic\\_on\\_cruise\\_ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_on_cruise_ships) \n3. A time delay of three weeks between infection and death. This delay is approximately consistent with a median 6 days to symptoms and 13 days from pneumonia confirmation to death. Sources: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus\\_disease\\_2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) and [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0320\\_article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0320_article) . It is also consistent with many of the individual case reports that I have read, example, infected on 1/14, dead on 2/07 [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html) . I also include a two week delay analysis to help understand model error.\n\nWith this simple data, we can easily reconstruct **how many Americans had the coronavirus three weeks prior**. We take the daily new death data, multiply it by 100 (since 1% died) and add it to the total infections of the day three weeks before.\n\n[Estimating prior infections](https://preview.redd.it/ecfxsfpjq8q41.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c69ab3bb304b26aa87440137d97e384738ecf37b)\n\nFrom this computation, we can see that the current US confirmed case number is of *177,000 is an underestimate by about one half of the total infections THREE WEEKS AGO*. This insight is the most important part of this post. We have way more cases right now than the vast majority realize. We're not going to be able to Korea our way out of this any time soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Estimating growth of infections and deaths**\n\nWithout massive intervention or a large proportion of the population infected we can use the growth in the number of deaths to estimate the growth rate of the infection. Below I fit an exponential curve to the growth of deaths to extract a parameter (lambda=3.54) for modeling future growth rate of the numbers of infected. I also included a fit for the last several days that possibly indicates a slight slowing of the growth rate. Note: All plots in this post are logarithmic.\n\n[Growth in number of deaths](https://preview.redd.it/u0dv1obas8q41.png?width=1551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2f421b200f4aa519f17f6ace25e0117de74d7a6)\n\nNow, we can use the that growth to extrapolate how many more people have been infected since the \\~314,000 on March 9th. Of course, that growth parameter has probably not remained constant. For that reason, I included some possible effects of social distancing whereby the growth halved or quartered starting on Monday, March 16th, when many business started suspending operations. I also assumed logistic growth so that the infection rate slows as more Americans are infected.\n\n[US infections, mid March through April](https://preview.redd.it/9gvfqjlav8q41.png?width=2249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4467a0e846a4e59bf15bc0952842cece4117a293)\n\nSo, to answer one of the initial questions: There are between 1 million and 100 million US cases at present. That's a huge range, but I am 95% sure that: **there are between 4 and 20 million US infections at present**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Estimating Deaths**\n\nIt gets ugly here. I know you're all bears, but I hope you're rooting for America and that we can pull a miracle. Lots of people will die.\n\nUsing the model for the number of infections, we can simply reverse the first process to find past number of infections to instead estimate the number of future deaths. Below, are estimates for total and daily deaths. The daily deaths will give us the best indication of which track we're on in the future. There's some discontinuity in that graph because I used the assumption that social distancing turned on all at once on 03/16, if we are on one of the lower tracks we will smooth into it in about a week's time. So yesterday's 912 deaths don't mean much yet as far as predicting the evolution of the disease.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[US Deaths, April through May](https://preview.redd.it/6mm2hvvsw8q41.png?width=2251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c31e0bad765c39169f6c243cca2a9684b1bd7aad)\n\nAs is clearly evident, there is no way we're only going to have 200,000 total deaths or a peak in two weeks unless social distancing is doing a much better job of quashing the spread than quartering it. Remember, this is also for 1% fatality rate, if deaths go up when hospitals are overwhelmed or because fat Americans die more, then there will be even more deaths. I am 80% sure that **we will have 1 million deaths minimum**. Hopefully, we sacrifice the economy a bit to save lives, but don't count on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Markets**\n\nThere's two main possibilities.\n\n1. Deaths peak between mid April and late May and that's when you should sell your puts because we are at peak fear.\n2. We do a good job of suppressing the spread, but we have to stay in quarantine for many months. The economy will be slowly burned and out and SPX goes (well) below 1800 in the late summer. June and later dated puts are going to do best here.",

        "selftext": "We're witnessing a macro historical pivot point in the making here lads and ladies.\n\nThe money men/power brokers are literally crashing capitalism with no survivors in order to secure their own individual stores of wealth. The best thing for capital markets right now would be a massive plunge, as a market depression will necessarily be followed by a corresponding cyclical recovery. Common sense, fundamental analysis, and TA all indicate markets *should* go down right now as the emerging harm to the real economy is unprecedented and incalculable.\n\nWhats happening now is capital markets are rising even as the real, hard economy is crashing. Intervention by the Fed is literally derailing the markets off their 'natural' course and the consequences could be exponentially more disastrous than a 'regular' economic depression/recession.\n\nIf the S&amp;P returns to approaching ATH even as unemployment edges towards 30% or more, the contradictions in the system and the inequality of wealth will be truly unsustainable and will result in actual structural collapse exterior to the capital market bust/boom cycle. We could be in a situation where we simultaneously have an ATH market cap and a consumer liquidity crisis. Double digit unemployment accompanied by inflation instead of deflation. Contradictions which will be an economic nuclear bomb.\n\nThink rioting in the streets and coups around the world as the financial elite see their wealth unharmed, with the burden instead passed on to everyone else. Imagine what the subsequent history of the United States would have looked like if FDR's 'New Deal' floated the securities market instead of redistributing wealth into federal infrastructure projects and job growth.\n\nCapitalism as we know it will be destroyed by a small group of individuals who want to die with their own wealth intact. Fuck what might happen 5-10 years down the line as long as they can get out unscathed.\n\nTLDR; JPow and Trump are setting the US up to become the next Zimbabwe so big money can exit unscathed",

        "selftext": "TLDR; Read the bottom of the post\n\nYesterday, [I told you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyvnxt/what_happened_and_why_markets_seem_irrational/) about the events of the past few months and what it will mean for us in the near future. Well, since I had nothing better to do since we're all stuck in our houses for the next few months, I've decided to do another DD where we look back at the history of the stock market, 100-year trends, basic macro-economics, and how we could have SPY at 84 in the next few years.\n\n# A History of the Stock Market and the US Economy\n\n[DJI 1900 - 2020, log scale](https://preview.redd.it/ebvoys6w3as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b415f5f30739160a2e0e8fb855f7735dc2b02575)\n\nThe chart you see above is a log-scale graph of the Dow from 1900 to now. You\u2019ll notice that there\u2019s a long-term support line, which made contact in the depth of the Great Depression, and during the late 1970s. So what does this line represent?\n\nIn the short term, markets are pretty random and irrational. In the long term, stock prices usually reflect earnings, and thus stock indexes grow alongside the economy. The purple line you see here is the exponential growth of the economy\u2019s productivity (and inflation to a certain extent) since the 1900s in cycles of growth driven by technological innovation, with the expectation of growth accelerating the inflation of equity valuations, followed by a crisis changing the fundamentals of the economy, and finally stagnation.\n\n**Pre-1929 - Electrification**\n\nThe period of the beginning of the 1900s to 1930 saw the rise of electricity being used in industries and in households, along with mass production techniques. This led to the workforce being more efficient at making things, leading to an increase in earnings, GDP, and the stock market.\n\n**1930s to mid-1940s - Depression and War**\n\nWe all know what happened during these periods. The Great Depression, which eventually led World War II. What caused this? To this day, economists still argue about what exactly happened, but here\u2019s a simplified version of what most people can agree on.\n\nFirst, what causes a recession? Fundamentally, a recession happens when the supply and demand in the economy become mismatched. If you have a sudden decrease in a supply, we call this a supply shock. This usually happens with an important commodity that\u2019s important to the economy, like oil. We\u2019ll revisit this in the 1970s. A sudden increase in supply is also a supply shock and can also cause an economic decline, such as in Venezuela's case. But in the 1930s, this was a demand shock.\n\nThere was a decrease in demand after the roaring 20s due to the large amount of consumer debt that people took on to fund their new household appliances, like toasters. In other words, consumers and the economy overall was overleveraged. These debt cycles are a natural economic phenomenon, but the economic decline was exasperated by the Fed\u2019s poor decision making; they basically did the opposite of what they\u2019re doing right now. They raised interest rates in an attempt to preserve the dollar\u2019s value, and a liquidity crunch followed where everyone was trying to get their hands on dollars. This caused a deflationary spiral. Banks, with no actual backing from the Fed at this time, started having runs where customers demand to withdraw all their deposits. Since banks usually loan out most of their cash, many of them begin running out of cash and go under, causing more people to panic that they\u2019ll lose all of their deposits and causing more bank runs.\n\nThis depression eventually led to a decade of economic depression, followed by a devastating war that destroyed much of the world\u2019s economy and infrastructure - except for countries in the Americas.\n\n**Late-1940s to early 1970s - The post-war boom**\n\nThe golden age of capitalism. This time instead of it being driven by some new technology, it was a combination of increased global trade, Keynesian economics, and the fact that the US was one of the few countries that didn\u2019t have almost all productive capacity destroyed in WWII.\n\n**1970s - Stagflation**\n\nThis was a period of stagflation, with both high inflation and economic stagnation, and was caused by a supply shock. Specifically, OPEC decided to cut their supply of oil to the US because they didn\u2019t like their support of Israel. Higher oil prices mean higher prices to produce everything and less things being produced. The Fed meanwhile had no idea how to respond to this, since according to Keynesian theory, high inflation and high unemployment were impossible. When you have stagnation, you lower interest rates, but with inflation already rampant this makes a bad situation worse.\n\n**1980s - 2020 - The Information Age**\n\nThe most recent long-term economic boom is the result of improved efficiency from globalization, computers, and the internet. Except for a small blip in 2008 caused by some dumbasses on Wall Street thinking a diversified pool of mortgages to people with no income or assets deserve a AAA rating, the economy has been enjoying a period of consistent growth - but for how long?\n\n**2020 - 2030 - Stagnation?**\n\nThere\u2019s a good argument here that we\u2019re at the top of the long-term business cycle, and that the GDP growth in the recent years has not been from increased productivity but fueled by debt and low interest rates. Think about it - it's been over 10 years since the last recession. Yet, throughout this entire time, the Fed rate has been held to effectively 0 and the government has been maintaining a deficit like we\u2019re still in the 2008 recession.\n\n[Fed funds rate, 1960 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/05b1ain56as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=126897b35b6d72adce6abe047dc395699abb6732)\n\n[US govt. surplus \\/ deficit](https://preview.redd.it/ywmsfco66as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43cdfcb1d0dfdb820c9e5441b1505ce8c2a898b2)\n\nEven with all this stimulus going on, the GDP is struggling to even get to 3%. If we didn\u2019t have artificially low interest rates and high federal deficits masking the GDP growth numbers, we\u2019d be seeing the US economy slowly head towards yet another period of stagnation. In fact, there\u2019s another very large country that experienced this - Japan.\n\n# Japan - The Economy of the Future\n\n[Bank of Japan interest rates](https://preview.redd.it/v6qj5fhg6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84cdbd023744e6ff606543bceaba2369cc98b507)\n\n[Japanese Government surplus \\/ deficits](https://preview.redd.it/42za9ewh6as41.png?width=1410&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59f22284c6e2e8292d08ea66f8cc77cad7ed940a)\n\nAfter nearly two decades of low interest rates and budget deficits, Japan can barely get their real GDP growth above 2%.\n\n[Japan GDP](https://preview.redd.it/73v8b9sp6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b54891a9f59801599f0086b8f799bbdc463682ff)\n\nLet\u2019s look at how the Japanese stock market is doing during this time.\n\n[Nikkei 225, 1980 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/h0gtdxhr6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9f4b878d85a18eebc01575a21904c5a03b34a25)\n\nWhat you\u2019re seeing here is the Nikkei 225 growing to its peak in 1990, crashing, and then never recovering to its previous highs. The Lost Score (20 years). But why didn\u2019t it ever recover? Don\u2019t stonks and the economy only go up in the long run?\n\nIn the late 1980s, Japan experienced an asset bubble fueled by **uncontrolled money supply and credit expansion**, overheating the asset market. They started to even start to buy corporate bonds in 2009 and buy stocks in 2010 out of desperation. Huh, this sounds pretty similar to what the Fed is doing right now.\n\n[Japanese Yen Inflation Rate](https://preview.redd.it/oftsdxex6as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfd500c5f8ac4395f4506a0933361767a233dca7)\n\nWhy did they do this? Because they were so reckless in their monetary easing policies that when the asset bubble popped and people stopped spending as much money due to the wealth effect. The Bank of Japan couldn\u2019t do anything to get people to spend money again, having already overheated their markets, and Japan went to two decades of deflation. They\u2019ve caused a **liquidity trap**.\n\nThe Bank of Japan and Japanese government has done everything to try to keep their GDP growing despite nothing actually driving it. Any productivity gains they would have gotten from the adoption of information technology was overshadowed by the decline of their automotive and electronics industries as they became less competitive with the rise of the Asian Tigers, and eventually China.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes. We\u2019ve seen that the US economy go into economic stagnation in the past, and modern economies are still in economic stagnation, with nothing except for unsustainable central bank money printing and government debt driving GDP growth. We\u2019ve also seen stock prices rise to new highs, despite nothing fundamentally changing in the real economy justifying the productivity growth across every industry. Low interest rates have also made stock buybacks the norm, with some companies like $PLAY levering themselves to buy back $630M of its own shares in 2019. Their market cap on Jan 1 2020 was around $1.2B. Are we in an asset bubble?\n\n# The Stock Market Bubble\n\nWell, what is an asset bubble? It\u2019s when asset prices surge beyond what the fundamentals of them warrant it. It\u2019s when investors become irrational in their valuation, and assume that the price of an asset will continue to go up in the future with no fundamental reasons justifying why it will other than that\u2019s what happened in the past. People on r/investing start telling people that they should \u201cDollar Cost Average\u201d into the markets when they go down because stocks will go back to new ATHs in a few years.\n\nEven with the argument that stocks will rebound in the near term to new ATHs because that\u2019s what happened in the past, this is only true if you don\u2019t look at data past 50 years ago and you pretend the US stock exchanges are the only ones in the world. Look at what happened in the 1970s. The Dow didn\u2019t make new significant highs in between 1966 and 1982. That\u2019s 16 years. If you account for the high inflation going on at this time, you would have been slowly losing money in real terms. Even more recently, look at the stock market in Japan. 30 years later and the Nikkei 225 still hasn\u2019t recovered to its previous highs. Imaging DCA-ing into that decline. Meanwhile in Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 hasn\u2019t come anywhere close to their 2000 highs from 20 years ago. The idea that the stock market will fundamentally always go up in a time span of a decade, which is the mainstream belief touted by every financial advisor and finance gurus is flawed; history and almost every major country\u2019s stock markets show this.\n\n[Euro Stoxx 50, 1990 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/yupt7ozt7as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0837c4aff8dd7eb088d28647547d7e7d72d2bcc5)\n\nHow can we tell if we\u2019re in a bubble? Let\u2019s look at the fundamentals of stocks, and what should be driving the true valuation of them - Earnings.\n\n[S&amp;P500 Shiller PE ratio](https://preview.redd.it/gobstuyy7as41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96143d6870fdb9c02293bcb6f29a7c069f36a6ec)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know if you\u2019re in a bubble until it bursts.\n\n**The Bottom**\n\nThe US economy is being driven by debt and consumer confidence. What happens when a black swan event happens that causes a supply shock by locking down supply chains, a demand shock by not allowing the service economy to operate, and another supply shock in the opposite direction happens in oil, because OPEC? Uncertainty and consumer confidence and spending to go down. After a decade of easy money, it might be hard for the Fed to do anything to restart consumer confidence, even years after COVID-19 is eradicated.\n\nLet\u2019s look back at the long term resistance in the Dow. If we do go into a decade-long deflationary spiral like Japan, we might be on our way to making contact with it, but it will be a slow, multi-year decline. If it takes 3 years to reach the 100-year trend, that will be the DJI declining to 10000 by 2023. That looks bad right? Let\u2019s calculate what a bottom would look like using another method. During the last two periods of long-term stagnation (1930s and 1970s), we saw the Shiller PE ratio of the S&amp;P500 drop down to 8 at the lowest levels. Today it is at 26. Even with pre-lockdown earnings, when the economy was in \u201cgreat shape\u201d, with low unemployment and high consumer confidence, this would represent a 70% decline in stock valuations, leaving us with the Dow at 7000 and S&amp;P500 at 840. Even going to the historic mean of 17, we should be seeing at least a 35% decline with the Dow at 15400 and S&amp;P500 at 1800.\n\nIn other words, as stock valuations cool down toward normal levels, we\u2019re likely going to see the Dow go to somewhere between 7000 and 15400, and the S&amp;P500 go somewhere between 1800 and 840 in the next few years.\n\n[\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bhat](https://preview.redd.it/qafgn26m8as41.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7227447a2f129e6871e73832472e75b1880ba032)\n\nTLDR; Read the title\n\nEDIT - Turns out you can't buy 2025 puts in Robinhood, so SPY 12/16/2022 175p\n\nInteresting video that goes a bit more in depth about the debt-driven growth of the US economy and stock market, and the liquidity trap its in - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loj0z43VZ7I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loj0z43VZ7I)\n\nEDIT2 - u/fancykevin00 brought up an interesting graphic showing the trend with the Fed increasing their balance sheet (QE) and what happened in the stock market during that time - [https://i.imgur.com/3NLR9rx.png](https://i.imgur.com/3NLR9rx.png)",

        "selftext": "So I had several accounts in Jtek's WSB discord server, which I signed up with throwaway emails unique in my domain. Guess what. They all just got spammed with [this](https://i.imgur.com/tl1dcWI.png). Note: that email was only used for a discord account that only joined the old server and did nothing else.\n\nHow did they collect these emails? The discord invite link that used to be on the sidebar asked permission to authorize a discord app to have access to your discord email, before redirecting you to the actual invite link. That way he harvest all of your emails. Check your \"Authorized apps\" in your discord account. [This is what you should see if you joined the server after the sidebar link was changed](https://i.imgur.com/4xNcJz5.png). It's likely if that's the case, you also got the spam email.\n\nI've been asked by mods to not point any fingers, but let's just say it was very likely a former mod.\n\nThe fucker completely sold us out, and is milking it as hard as he can.\n\n**Edit 1:** If you live in California, [CCPA](https://www.smartrmail.com/blog/ccpa-email-marketing/) might apply to you. In Europe, GDPR might too. He also violated Discord's [terms of service](https://discordapp.com/terms) since it prohibits \"attempt to obtain passwords or other private information from other members;\" by harvesting emails and IPs.\n\n**Edit 2:** According to Cam, he had no idea that the email list was obtained illegitimately, please do not direct any hate towards him. While he did make the mistake of accepting a random email list without making sure the emails listed were interested, the person who sold him the email list is who we should care the most about right now. Cam said a discord account (now deleted) approached him about this. [Here is what he told me](https://i.imgur.com/qSiQ6jI.png). And [here](https://i.imgur.com/QOC7IZ4.png) is his statement in his Discord.\n\n**Edit 3:** This thread is getting so popular I should write a book about it to make money off of autists :\\^)\n\n**Edit 4:** Cam also said he got the email list \"a couple of weeks ago or like two weeks ago, hard to remember, I get 100s of messages a day\". ~~So it's likely the former mod started selling us out before he got banned.~~ Nope, check edit 7 later on.\n\n**Edit 5:** Holy shit. [Check this out](https://imgur.com/a/owgqjvB), a conversation between 2 mods from Jtek's server, one of them sent me that.\n\nThe mod who sent me that screenshot said then:\n\n&gt; Now the guy who does tech support for the discord is claiming the VM that the bot that collected our info on was hacked.\n&gt;\n&gt;But still, they harvested our info through shady means.\n\nBut was it really hacked, or is that the excuse they're coming up with?\n\n**CHANGE YOUR DISCORD PASSWORD. AND IF YOU USED THAT PASSWORD FOR YOUR BROKERAGE ACCOUNT, YOU'RE A DUMBASS, AND CHANGE THAT TOO.** Who knows what they're up to.\n\nWhat seems to be implied is that\n\n1. Initially they collected usernames and passwords\n2. Eventually they changed the method to just link their app to your discord account and collected your email and IP\n\n**Edit 6:** Thank you all for the support guys. I'm now announcing my very own [WSB championship](https://wsb.gg/championship). Please sign up now as spots are limited. More details to be announced soon.\n\n**Edit 7:** [I found a guy who was creating daily accounts and joining that Discord server because he kept getting banned daily, so we discovered the email list includes all emails up until April 8th (maybe 9th).](https://i.imgur.com/c602xix.png) **Which means he started selling these emails immediately after he got banned.** Not before.\n\n**Edit 8:** [Here](https://imgur.com/a/80WLtNG) are the conversations they had back then about this. They *knew*. Also, it's possible they never collected passwords, but only usernames and emails. That's if they always used that method. It's still unconfirmed.\n\n**Edit 9:** Jartek and other admins started to remove mods from the server to try to curb the leaks. Most mods have turned against them already and saved every bit of incriminating evidence. I'm collecting them and publishing them here whenever we find something juicy.\n\n**Edit 10:** [I'd like to announce my new book](https://i.imgur.com/3QDbY4h.png). And with that, I'm out of ideas on how to make money off of you guys. Does anyone know someone who can give me some fresh new ideas? Perhaps someone experienced in this area?",

        "selftext": "Mortgage Servicing Crisis - Chapter 2 - Forbearances\n\nI submitted a post last week summarizing some issues in the mortgage industry. It was a long article from Barry Habib with some insight/conclusions. I'm writing this to add to that post with some additional info about what's going on in the industry and how the forbearances are impacting mortgage servicing.  \n\nThe two big points from the previous post that I'll touch upon:\nMargin Calls - the Fed buying mortgage-backed-securities (MBS) was causing lenders to run into significant margin calls, a fairly significant risk to lenders. Lenders hedge their locked loan pipelines against market fluctuations. \n\nForbearance Poses Risk to Lenders - The CARES Act, Section 4022, provides that a mortgage servicer must provide borrowers a forbearance of up to an initial 180 days, and then it can be renewed for a subsequent 180 days. During this period, the servicers are expected to keep making payments to the asset owner - Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac / Ginnie Mae (the government sponsored enterprises, or GSEs). So, even if providing the borrower the loan forbearance required by the CARES Act, a servicer is sending payments to the GSEs. As I'll discuss below, the Act does not identify specific methods to resolve the forbearance at the end of the period. \n\nSo, whats new?\nWell, the margin call is still an issue - but the fed backed off of their level of MBS purchasing by a little bit, but not enough to resolve the issue. Lenders clearing out their active loans will help resolve this, so in time it will improve as long as the Fed continues to be timid on MBS purchase. It will still hurt lenders but I don't think this is going to be a nail in the coffin for any of the big servicers. \n\nThe forbearance process is worth further describing. So, hypothetical situation: lets say I have a mortgage serviced by Quicken (don't get excited they are private) and I just heard the CARES Act allows me to skip payments. I'm a waiter, I just got laid off, I could really use 3 months without my $2k mortgage payments. I call them, wait on hold for two hours, and then they agree to let me not make payments for the next three months - and they will send the info to sign. Great, right? Almost too good to be true. \n\nSo, here are the three outcomes of a forberance after Quicken quickly agrees to it:\n\n1.) BY DEFAULT -  From the borrower's perspective, I don't hear anything for three months. Then, in month 4, Quicken calls and says I have 4 payments, three of which are \"delinquent.\" I now learn there are 4 payments - all due in month 4. Well, hold on I just returned to work I don't have $8k - what can I do besides YOLO FDs? Well, probably not much. \n\n\n2.) Payment Plan - the next option is to resolve that past due $6k on a payment plan, if the lender agrees to this. So instead of a $2k payment, I might have a $2500 payment for a year. Now I just returned to my service industry job - I was already paycheck to paycheck, I have all sorts of other past due credit card/auto/student loan bills from being laid off, and now my mortgage is 25% higher. That's not going to work for me.\n\n\n3.) Loan Modification - A loan modification is the option that everyone thinks they are getting through CARES Act by default - it extends the term of the mortgage and adds the missed payments to the end. This is not a scenario that will be provided over the phone as an immediate solution if I call Quicken and ask. It has to be applied for, I would have to qualify, and it has to be approved by the lender. It is not a trivial request, and it will not be approved lightly given the current lending environment and amount of credit risk. Plus, considering the lender has already made 3+ payments to the GSEs without one from me - they are going to want to quickly determine whether this is going to be a performing loan or a non-performing loan (more to come on this). They will want to flush out the good loans from the bad as soon as they can get past the time periods required in the CARES Act. \n\nSo, a loan modification requires a level of qualification (credit check, paystubs, etc.). As a borrower, I am then going to have to show this lender the amount of debt I've racked up paying for everything with credit cards while laid off - and how fucked my credit has gotten not paying any bills while waiting for my $1200 Starbucks allowance from the Feds.\n\nI am a Loan Officer, as mentioned in the previous post. Half my week has been talking to past clients about forbearanaces, and most of them just want a few months of skipped payments so they can relax about the economy and have that safety net. Sure, some have lost their jobs or are on the verge of losing their jobs - in which case it makes sense, your alternative is worse. One owns three rentals I've financed and 0/3 renters can pay their rent this month. \n\nSO MANY PEOPLE are requesting the forbearance on an elective basis that our industry experts are begging real estate professionals to properly describe to them how this works, and what they will be faced with. Servicers are quick to approve the forbearance, and the borrowers are not understanding the possible outcomes. \n\nI have a friend I consider to be a business-minded, prudent, and intelligent individual. He called servicers for two properties, US Bank and Wells Fargo - one offered a forbearance of 3 months and the other offered 6 months. He took them, they said they'd send something for him to sign but that it was in effect. Neither made any effort whatsoever to explain to him the resulting options at the end of the forbearance. He called me to ask if it would have any adverse impact, as they had not described the process well to him. \n\nThese are call centers taking the requests, obviously they are doing what they can to get to the next call.  \n\nMy company has a $110B servicing portfolio, and we got 8000 requests for forbearances IN A WEEK. Mr. Cooper (subject of my last post) has a $640B servicing portfolio. \n\nAt the end of this initial 3-6 month forbearance that lenders are required to offer, we are going to see lenders quickly decide how to handle each file. As mentioned above, they consider the account delinquent during the forbearance (although not reported to credit) - so they already have a jump on the next steps to collect past-due payments. There will likely be a flood of \"performing\" loans (paid on time) turning into \"non-performing loans\" (past-due 180+ days). If a loan becomes non-performing, the GSEs end up auctioning off the assets (mortgage notes) in blocks. These blocks are generally bought at auction by funds and securitized into non-performing loan MBSs. Of the companies that do this, there are only a few that have publicly traded entities. \n\nNow, I'll touch briefly on what is going on with mortgage lending - because a lot of the servicers like Quicken have revenue split between originating and servicing:\nPurchase Volume - The last two weeks we saw purchase mortgage applications decline 15% and 11%. Personally, I have had a noticeable reduction in purchase apps, and all of my preapproved borrowers are putting their home search on hold.\nRefinance Volume - Because of current credit risk lenders are considering, rates are only attractive on an owner-occupied primary residence with an optimal borrower. Low credit score, investment properties, etc., have rates so high they don't make sense. \nGeneral Volume - Loan programs have tightened up considerably in the last two weeks. Yesterday my company scrapped all of our jumbo programs. We had already scrapped all of our non-QM programs (subprime). Our FICO requirements are up 40 points, for self-employed individuals we can only use 75% of their income now, use of gift funds is more restrictive, etc. We are definitely going to see less individuals qualifying for financing because of these guideline adjustments. \n\nTL;DR folks can start here with only knowing \"non-bank mortgage lenders in trouble\"\n\nHow to use this info:\n1.) Puts on non-bank mortgage lenders - They are going to suffer because all of their revenue comes from originating and the residual from servicing. They are going to lose the servicing revenue on a significant amount of non-performing loans, and they are going to have trouble originating loans for at least a few months. My last post included COOP, the largest publicly traded servicer - they also originate. I still like it and expect the underlying share price to continue to decline, but the premiums are outrageous right now. I like puts on any non-bank publicly traded mortgage originating/servicing company. Not 100% in line with this recommendation, but I decided to make a move on REM which is a closed-end mortgage-based REIT. It has 80% in residential mortgage securities and 20% commercial (which I also think is vulnerable). \nSo, REM 15p 10/16\n\n2.) I spent a long time last night reading the auction results from non-performing loans and then looking up the buyers to see which publicly traded companies might mostly focus on NPLs. I wanted to buy calls on companies that focus on NPLs, anticipating they would have a higher volume in coming months. Most are either private, or they securitize the loans and aren't exposed, or they are too diversified in other aspects of real estate to anticipate the NPL volume helping share price. I don't have a great play here. If someone wants a fun research project, go try to find a company who services NPLs, is publicly traded, and is not well-diversified. Although I did not find them buying recent auction pools (I only looked at '19) I did take a position in [an option with an underlying value too low for this post to get approved] because they focus on NPLs and at an auction long ago they received 90% of the NPLs being offered by the GSEs. The premiums were cheap and their share price is 30% of what it was in February. \n\nThere are some banks with significant mortgage servicing rights, but I think the Feds are more likely to let the non-bank lenders fail. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions on positions to take based on this info, please do comment with it. I know we had some MBS guys and other people in the mortgage industry comment on the last post, would be interested for more input. \n\nTL:DR : Fed says you don't have to pay your mortgage, lenders agree quickly to forbearances, borrowers will be expected to pay in full at the end of the period - but they aren't understanding that, on a large scale. \nCOOP 5p 10/16 (but maybe wait for a bounce the premiums are nuts)\nREM 15p 10/16",

Choose some solid stocks, make your own plan, and avoid the \"yolo i am all in\" approach. \n\nPersonally, I see stock market as a supplement to my humble paycheck. I'd love to someday see it get to the moon of course, but so far my patient approach has kept me content. I take a few bites here and there, keep adding to my portfolio and occasionally sell too. I make mistakes too, but within my limits. And sometimes it sucks to see how little I make in comparison to the more sophisticated, rich players. But I am proud of all that I have so far, and everything I have, starting from scratch just a few years ago. \n\nGo watch some Seinfeld. You deserve it.",

        "selftext": "After my last post, I had multiple people asking if I could take a deeper look into the renewable energy industry. Since I\u2019m also very interested and I feel it will become a very important sector, I took the time to review it. First of all, let me explain why investing now is a good time. \n\nWhen you look at manufacturers, the biggest market cap is not even $5 billion. There is so much room for growth and there\u2019s also a lot of competition. When you can point your finger at the best company, it might be the homerun for your portfolio in 10-15 years. Even if you don\u2019t hit the right one, it\u2019s still gonna be ok since the industry is only growing. To be clear, I only looked at manufacturers, not distributors. You won\u2019t see any companies like NEE, DUK, BEP, etc. \n\nSecondly, you all know Trump doesn\u2019t believe in environmentally issues, renewable energy and that sort of stuff. With elections coming up, investments might stay the same or they might go up drastically when the democrats win. Either way, the sector will continue to grow and you can\u2019t really go bad with investing in it. \n\nLast argument, I feel like a lot of people don\u2019t know the importance of solar energy yet. It goes beyond the industry, as it gets implemented more and more by other industries. It\u2019s already a big item for giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon,\u2026 to keep their cloud servers running for example. \n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nIn this post, I will focus on solar energy the most, as it is the biggest and most important part of renewable energy. Based on market cap from the solar industry, we have 3 leaders and 7 others on a significant distance, but still able to get to the top for the next 5-10 years. From that top 10, RUN, SPWR and VSLR fall off based on financials.  \n\n**ENPH**  \nMarket leader on micro-inverters (the things that convert solar charge into electricity). Even their inverters get used by big competitors like SPWR. Investing more and more into energy storage. It\u2019s focussing on the private market, which might be a short term problem, but their inverters are definitely their big win. Not only do they receive revenue from their own installations, but they have other companies using their products as well when installing other products, making ENPH techniques present in an enormous amount of solar installations. The financials are great, they have a decent amount of cash to get investing and they\u2019re only profitable since last year, giving them a lot of room to grow. They\u2019re bound to get number one position in solar tech and they didn\u2019t even launch their best technology yet. \n\n**SEDG**  \nGreat financials as well. Assets over double amount of liabilities, almost no long term debt and enough cash to get growing. Very big growth on revenue. They were planning to even double their production in 2020 and release some new products, but that\u2019s gonna be delayed a bit. They are working with TSLA on batteries and charging stations. It all looks very positive, although I have to point out some people are calling SEDG \u2018yesterday\u2019s solution\u2019. It might be up and keep growing a lot, but if you want the best 10 year investment, you should stick with ENPH. \n\n**FSLR**  \nVery inconsistent income, but a great balance sheet. Assets 3 times liabilities and loads of cash to get investing into the future. Their profit margins are pretty small though, in comparison to the industry. FSLR is the only company that works with utility companies to provide energy. To draw you a simple picture: if you get electric energy at home, it\u2019s been delivered by utility companies and the energy itself is mostly created by FSLR. Over the past few years, utilities are losing market share because people are buying and setting up their own energy installations at home. Therefore utilities, and by extension FSLR, are losing market share. Because of the crisis, people will be less likely to install their own installations as unemployment numbers are rising. FSLR could be the better short term bet, but it\u2019s hard to predict when it will turn around again and they will definitely lose long term. \n\n**JKS**  \nVery innovative techniques, one of the most efficient solar panels on the market. Therefore gaining a lot of advantage on their competitors, or \u2018moat\u2019 by Warren Buffett terms. If you feel like solar panels are the most important part of the industry, I would definitely suggest looking into JinkoSolar. They have a lot of cash to get investing, low on long term debt and I see them coming the closest to top 3 in the future.\n\n**CSIQ**  \nLooking for value, then this is the one. PEG ratio of only 0.19, the industrial average is 0.68. Have to point out as well that their growth rate isn\u2019t that great and you might wait a long long time to get the gains going on this one. They also have a lawsuit running against them, claiming to steal Solaria\u2019s patented module technology. \n\n**NOVA**  \nThey might get hit hard by covid-19. Sunnova is a pretty young company, full on investing and expanding, thus having low cash reserves. They might need to be backed by bailout money, putting them even further behind the top 5 solar companies. When they get back in 1-2 years, I feel like the other companies will have too much of a head start. \n\n**AZRE**  \nThey have experienced almost no impact from covid-19 as an Indian based company. Their projects have not been impacted and the plants are running full force. However there has been significant reduction in demand and they\u2019ve been seeing delayed payments from customers. It operates like First Solar, selling energy to government utilities. Big profit margins as well, so they might get out of this crisis easily. That\u2019s also the main reason why the stock didn\u2019t drop that much. Growth will be limited, but a stable investment. \n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nNext, I\u2019m gonna mention some other renewable energy resources. I took one of the best companies per industry as an example, but I\u2019m not gonna go through those resources more deeply as I don\u2019t believe in them.\n\n**VWDRY**  \nThe wind energy industry is more inconsistent than solar energy, therefore not the most favorable kind of resource to invest in. It also doesn\u2019t have real potential to expand to private use, but whoever wants to invest in it, I suggest VWDRY. It is the biggest company in the world in terms of wind power. Apart from having the most and biggest wind farms, they also offer their maintenance and knowledge to help optimizing other wind farm locations. Vestas also just signed a great contract with a Danish energy company for delivery in the upcoming next years. They have a lot of cash ready to invest and they also have decent value, so you can\u2019t really go wrong with them.\n\n**REGI**  \nREGI produces and sells biofuels and renewable chemicals. It produces biomass-based diesel, using corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat amongst other things. The company might be in bad weather, as they are low on cash. They are operating in an investment needing industry, so it\u2019s definitely not the right moment for a financial crisis like this.\n\nAs you can see, I didn\u2019t include nuclear energy companies. Nuclear energy is a green energy solution and definitely isn\u2019t bad. However it\u2019s not growing like solar and wind because it has a lot of negative feedback and image. There is more waste, it\u2019s more expensive and therefore also less investments. It\u2019s easy math, the more volume, the lower price. No one is investing in nuclear, so pricing can\u2019t compete with other resources. \n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nFor me, this research was surprising. I was expecting to find more small companies with breaking innovative techniques, but it seems like the ones at the top are predicted to stay there and increase distance. If anyone has some valuable information on small companies, definitely share them in this thread.\n\nTo conclude, ENPH and SEDG are without a doubt the best investments right now. Depending on your timeline, you might want to sell SEDG in 5-10 years, while keeping ENPH for a lifetime. JKS is the higher risk, higher reward kinda bet here, with still decent coverage of risk.\n\nThere are of course way more other renewable energy resources, but I don\u2019t know enough about them. If I would start researching them, I might be working like a professional broker/investor and I decided that I\u2019ve put enough energy into stock research the past weeks. Right now, I\u2019m gonna enjoy the weather, work a bit in the garden and passively buy some shares this week with all that info I\u2019ve gathered over the past few months.",

        "selftext": "In a nutshell, we  have a huge global oil supply glut because everything is on lock down  (mainly China).  \n \n\nOil prices have cratered from $70/brl in Jan to $22/brl right now. Saudi  Arabia can survive on this. Russia can go broke slow on this. American  shale dies at this level. So SA &amp; Russia are playing a little footsy  to keep prices down and bankrupt the American shale patches, even  though they absolutely hate each other. But they want that China market  share. Trump knows this and has been doing everything he can to broker a  deal to cut production to get oil prices up. Why? Becuz - our energy  sector in the US (especially the oil sector) is leveraged up their ass  with debt. So much debt, living paycheck to paycheck with bank loans.  Banks are ready to take possession of the smaller companies already kind  of debt. You think we've seen a stock market slide? Companies like  Chesapeake and Marathon are probably goners. If that goes up the food  chain to COP or XOM, and they default? (They aren't in the stimulus  package btw, so that would require even more bailout) This stock market  goes tits the \\*\\*\\*\\* up and 45 can kiss 2020 election good bye. SO. OPEC+  and Russia got together with a bunch of other oil countries (Not the US,  because we have antitrust laws and don't play the monopoly price game)  and agreed to a massive oil production cut to try to stabilize oil  prices. Everyone played nice except Mexico. You probably think Mexico  doesn't matter in this game. But they do. They wanted Mexico to take a  400,000 barrel a day cut as part of the whole 10M/brl a day cut that the  whole group wants to accomplish. Problem. Mexico is hedged up the ass  against oil price crashes (they're like the only one) and said go \\*\\*\\*\\*  yourselves. We're printing money and we like that. So they said, we'll  do 100,000 brls/day cause we want to play ball and there's a global  pandemic. SA said \\*\\*\\*\\* you, no deal. So Trump jumps in and says, the US  will make up the 300,000 barrels a day that Mexico won't so can we have  deal plz? SA says \\*\\*\\*\\* you. Why? Because we have never told oil  producers how much they can drill for or not drill for becuz capitalism.  We produce enough oil to have a seat at the oil table with OPEC and  Russia, but we don't play those games. So, the question is - does the  federal government mandate our private oil companies cut production to  make up for Mexico's share to get the deal done? Easy yes, right?  Stabilize prices, everyone wins, right? Except - remember, all these  companies are leveraged like crazy and at these prices if they can't  produce fast enough, they get repoed. So they have to keep selling oil  or they die.   \n \n\nTLDR - Trump needs this deal so the market doesn't go tits up and he can  get re-elected. If we do the deal, capitalism takes another hit and  small oil producers get \\*\\*\\*\\*ed.\n\nUps/Downs: These fucks never find a way to deal and they don't want to. Oil goes to 15 and the shale patch goes tits up. Banks repo. Market crashes. Look, I know we are obsessed with the coronas. I think this is where the real battle is. When US oil goes under. And it will. That's what takes the rest of the house of cards with it.",

But in China, jobless indicators are released on a monthly or even quarterly basis, and cover only part of the workforce.\n\n&gt; The most widely cited figure, the surveyed urban unemployment rate issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), jumped to an all-time high\nof 6.2 per cent in January and February combined, up from 5.2 per cent in December. This roughly equated to an additional 5 million people thrown out of work.\n\n&gt; Another government metric, the urban registered jobless rate, is published quarterly and measures only the urban residents willing to file tedious reams of paperwork to register as being unemployed. This indicator has been stable at a rate of around 4 per cent for years, with few fluctuations over economic cycles.\n\n&gt; Due to the lack of official data covering China\u2019s entire workforce, economists and analysts have started to rely on private surveys, online job listings, anecdotal reports and even indicators such as subway rides in major cities to get a clearer view of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the unemployment situation in China.\n\n&gt; Beijing\u2019s challenge\nis particularly severe given the lack of an adequate social safety net in China.\n\n&gt; Unemployment benefits are small and reserved for only a few \u2013 a maximum of 2.5 million people claimed unemployment benefits in each quarter over the past decade, in a country of almost 1.4 billion.\n\n&gt; \u201cRural migrant workers who lost their paid work are generally not included in government data,\u201d Lu said. \u201cMany of them may find it hard to maintain their previous living standards. Many migrant workers will have to go back to their farmland to support a basic lifestyle.\u201d\n\nTL;DR: China is under reporting unemployment data and unemployed people don't really have a social safety net.",

Any other serious broker should work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Quick intro\n\nIf you don't know what Eurodollars are, look it up first, eg. the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodollar) page to get an ELI5. The main thing to understand is that Eurodollars have little to do with euros or exchange rates, and everything to do with INTEREST rates, specifically the 3-month USD LIBOR rate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe futures contracts are priced on a 0-100 scale (mostly, could go over 100 with negative rates for example), with the price being 100 - LIBOR3M. So, if LIBOR is say 1%, price of the futures contract would be 100-1 = 99. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# THE PLAY: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe current LIBOR3M rate is 1.21888% (see [this page](https://www.global-rates.com/interest-rates/libor/american-dollar/usd-libor-interest-rate-3-months.aspx) for the current rates) as of April 09. That would imply a Eurodollar settlement at 98.78112. However, the pricing on the May front-month options /GEM0 is at 99.485, which implies a rate of 0.515% for the LIBOR in May. **NOT GONNA HAPPEN!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what you want to buy are the May 15 puts on the June 2020 futures. Unlike regular stonk options, Eurodollar FOPs come in **2500x multipliers**. The price on the May 15 99p is $0.0050, which means 1 contract will cost you $12.5 + commisions, so $1000 will buy you about 80 contracts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How much can you make you ask?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, if the LIBOR3M remains flat at 1.21888%, you'll make (99 - (100 - 1.21888)) \\* 2500 \\* NUM\\_CONTRACTS. So, for $1000 = 80 contracts = $43,776\n\nIf the LIBOR moves back to last week's high, 1.45%, you'll make $90,000 per $1k. \n\nAnd if the LIBOR moves to over 2%, like I expect it to, you'll make $200,000 or more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beauty in this play is that it works for bulls and bears alike. If you're bearish =&gt; shit's fucked =&gt; LIBOR loans become more risky =&gt; higher LIBOR. If you're bullish &amp; everything goes back to ATH =&gt; higher LIBOR, either through inflationary expectations or higher rate expectations. If you think everything gonna stay flat, you still make 43x.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember that this is not investment advice and you should do your own DD before following some retard on the internet. That said, I'm willing to answer whatever questions you guys have, just post a comment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy Eurodollar (ticker /GE) May 15 / June puts at either 99 for $0.0050 or 98.875 for $0.0025.",

        "selftext": "Being an aviation nerd, I noticed something strange on my flight tracker app. Fiji Airways is operating a nonstop flight from Nadi to Salt Lake City, a route they don't normally operate. Strange. Further investigation showed another odd flight, this time a LATAM 767 coming in from South America into SLC. My initial thought was that these planes were being shipped to America for long term storage because there was NO possible way that sudden demand between Nadi and Salt Lake City warranted a nonstop flight.\n\nBut then I found this article: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/31/mormon-church-is-chartering-jets-bring-thousands-missionaries-home/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/31/mormon-church-is-chartering-jets-bring-thousands-missionaries-home/) (press the X in your browser as soon as loading is complete to avoid ad block popup)\n\nThe Mormon church waited until the very last minute to bring home missionaries from the Philippines. Even travel restrictions by the US government didn't phase them. It took the president of the Philippines fucking threatening to kill people who violated quarantined for the Mormon church to take this seriously. Now that most international flight schedules have been canceled, their only option is to charter jets, hence the Fiji Airways and LATAM flights.\n\nFrom their own website, it appears that these are VERY recent developments. By recent, I mean APRIL-recent. And as for the Fiji Airways flight, it is still in the air as I am writing this. [The Mormon website](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/coronavirus-update#missionary-work) states that only two missionaries have tested positive for the virus so far, and all are being ordered to self-isolate in their homes before returning to missionary activities in the USA. If you're reading this and thinking \"what the actual fuck, I've been quarantined for almost 3 weeks and they're just brining back missionaries now?\", you're not alone.\n\nSo what businesses will be affected by this? **EVERY BUSINESS THAT USES CALL CENTERS BASED IN AMERICA.** American call centers frequently favor Utah because of its large population of well-educated young adults: [https://www.standard.net/news/business/low-cost-young-workforce-makes-utah-a-magnet-for-call/article\\_186c92d0-e2c2-552e-add6-59127ddd8468.html](https://www.standard.net/news/business/low-cost-young-workforce-makes-utah-a-magnet-for-call/article_186c92d0-e2c2-552e-add6-59127ddd8468.html). Additionally, Skywest is based in Utah. If you're wondering where the connection between Mormons and Utah is, then you simply haven't been to Utah. In fact, it is safe to assume that Utah is the **only** state still experiencing an influx of international travel.\n\nMormons are good people, just like the rest of us. It is a shame those in charge of their organization failed to recognize this potential risk and is now endangering an entire state. I do not currently hold any positions related to this, as I have just made the discovery today. With that said, I am a full on bear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR \u2013** The Mormons forgot to bring their kids home from the third world and they're chartering big jets to do it now.

I am the most retarded, and that is why you should listen to me.\n\nFirst, a cold hard fact is that TA is mostly bullshit. This is because people who have a \"hunch\" that the market will go up will draw lines up, so they can buy. Those who want to sell draw lines going down and say I think it's going down. You can do this all day with support and resistance all day and all this does is confirm bias. \n\nThere are, however, a few technical indicators which are more reliable, although not fool-proof, because everyone knows JPOW is batshit crazy and at this point would suck a homeless man's dick for some crack.\n\nEvening star doji forming on a one day SPY chart: \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/jQkSqhG\n\nand an an graphic of what that pattern indicates:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/HgDjNEm\n\nThis basically is saying that the market has just reached that point in the roller coaster where you're at the top kind of, like oh fuck. Think of it like the height of a jump where you're just hanging in air before you come down.\n\nIt's also significant because buying pressure and volume has been continuing to drop off as SPY climbs higher (see first image)\n\nUsually large amounts of volume pull the price in one direction or another, but here we are still going high with no volume. Ripe for a reversal as buyers are becoming more skeptical and not entering into trades as quickly. \n\nWhat does this mean? I have no clue I am a fucking retard. \n\nWith that being said. I am an American, and a fucking proud one too. Never in my life, have I wanted to see this bullshit tumble so hard in my life. Fuck trump, fuck the fed, fuck these businesses that I keep paying for to stay afloat, and fuck the corrupt financial system so disconnected from reality that trump saying the economy will open like a theme park shoots prices higher when they are surrounded by millions without work who have no guarantees to be rehired when this pandemic is contained.\n\nTL;DR SPY is forming an evening star reversal pattern.

Because once the opportunity finally comes, you probably won't have the resources to make the moves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1:\n\nLooks like I offended a lot of people, which was not my intention. I am not trying to predict the bottom at all. I know I don't know.\n\nAll I was saying was is, when this \"bottom\" happens, it will be at a point where most people are scared. Whether it be because they are in debt or because they have lost faith in the market. It's not going to be as easy \"this is cheap, buy now, I will get returns a few years from now\". There's a lot of new investors thinking it's that easy.\n\nRisks aren't easy. Those 10% drops we saw several weeks ago was child's play. You'll know what I mean if/when it happens. When you are legit scared to put money in because you lost faith in the market and economy.\n\nI'm an Average Joe. I'm continuing do DCAing and buying at my usual rate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI guess I offended people with this as well:\n\n\"unless you and your family are already rich with job security and healthy\"\n\nThat definitely came out wrong. I didn't mean that to rich shame.\n\nI still believe in America. And there will still be opportunities. But once again, I think the idea of just buying at this bottom is easier said than done, especially for people who aren't already wealthy or financially stable. And for those that do have the ballz to buy big in a fearful market, I think 9 out of 10 (and that's being VERY generous), will get burnt trying to make it during these hard times. But that's another topic.\n\nGood luck to everybody. Invest smart.",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: Remember the mortgage default crisis of the Great Recession with fondly? No? Well you soon will refer to that bloody mess as \"the good old days\".**\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-02/home-lenders-brace-for-up-to-15-million-u-s-mortgage-defaults\n\n&gt;Mortgage lenders are preparing for the biggest wave of delinquencies in history. If the plan to buy time works, they may avert an even worse crisis: Mass foreclosures and mortgage market mayhem.\n\n&gt;Borrowers who lost income from the coronavirus -- already a skyrocketing number, with a record 10 million new jobless claims -- can ask to skip payments for as many as 180 days at a time on federally backed mortgages, and avoid penalties and a hit to their credit scores. But it\u2019s not a payment holiday. Eventually, they\u2019ll have to make it all up.\n\n&gt;As many as 30% of Americans with home loans \u2013 about 15 million households \u2013- could stop paying if the U.S. economy remains closed through the summer or beyond, according to an estimate by Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\n&gt;\u201cThis is an unprecedented event,\u201d said Susan Wachter, professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe great financial crisis happened over a number of years. This is happening in a matter of months -- a matter of weeks.\u201d\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, lenders are operating in the dark, with no way of predicting the scope or duration of the pandemic or the damage it will wreak on the economy. If the virus recedes soon and the economy roars back to life, then the plan will help borrowers get back on track quickly. The greater the fallout, the harder and more expensive it will be to stave off repossessions.",

        "selftext": "Hello, dumdums -\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's me, Fuzzy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you all had a productive weekend of crying yourself to sleep / awake, relentlessly beating your meat and waiting for the markets to open. As promised on \\[Friday\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu7dmg/everything\\_you\\_always\\_wanted\\_to\\_know\\_about\\_swaps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu7dmg/everything_you_always_wanted_to_know_about_swaps/)), today in the neighborhood we're going to be working through a full breakdown of everybody's favorite low-rent purveyor of curly fries, pinball and sticky-carpeted sadness - Dave &amp; Busters ($PLAY), as suggested by \\[u/leonardnimoyNC1701\\]([https://www.reddit.com/user/leonardnimoyNC1701/](https://www.reddit.com/user/leonardnimoyNC1701/)). Sadly, the question of whether he's a $PLAY bagholder or just a big fan of Street Fighter 2 and shitty beer remains unanswered. Anyway, let's do this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of reminders for the first time readers and slow learners in the audience (which I imagine applies to most, if not all of you):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I will answer any legitimate question I get asked about the post, no matter how stupid (as long as it is sincere or at least funny). Sometimes it takes me a couple of days but I get around to everybody eventually. I do this because getting flamed by someone who knows what they're talking about is the only way to learn - it's how I learned, and it works. \\*\\*But remember - I don't give advice for free\\*\\*. So please don't ask me what to buy (long $ONIONS), if your 95% OTM option is fucked (almost certainly, unless you're long $BA) or for a strike/exp ($SPY 69p 4/20 blaze it) because I'll just have to repeat that in the comments and you'll look like a big dummy.\n2. The fact that I am posting this is not indicative of any view I have on D&amp;B one way or the other; this was just the most upvoted ticker in Friday's post. I do this shit because (i) I enjoy it and (ii) I want you retards to learn how to do your own legwork.\n3. Most upvoted ticker / financial concept in the comments will get the next breakdown. This will likely be market open Monday \\*\\*next week\\*\\* as I have some more basic financial literacy I'd like to ram down your throats before then.\n4. Finally, and perhaps most importantly - u/pokimane. Girl, WSB is getting a little crazy. Why don't you and me get out of here; my offer to tell you which stonks to buy remains open (as do my DMs).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOK - on with the show. This is actually a pretty interesting case study; D&amp;B have in the last month (i) successfully warded off some adverse interest from KKR  (ii) closed all their locations (iii) lost 90% of their equity value and (iv) against all odds, smashed earnings. Plus, like many of you bagholding autists, as a result of the current market they've also had to open themselves up to taking some deep PIPE - although in their case, that stands for a Public Investment in Private Equity (rather than the more... literal version of 'pipe' that ends with you, your desperation finance OnlyFans channel, and that one 'won't take no for an answer' subscriber named Chuck). Don't worry; I'll explain all of this as we go along (other than the Chuck thing).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR\\*\\* ? Fuck you. This will take you 10 minutes at most to work through and you'll learn something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay. Ready? Let's do this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*1.\\*\\* \\*\\*Things You'll Need To Play Along At Home\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* \\[D&amp;B Credit Agreement\\]([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1525769/000114420417044736/v473864\\_ex10-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1525769/000114420417044736/v473864_ex10-1.htm))\n\n\\* \\[D&amp;B 10-K\\]([https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1525769/000119312520098060/d832311d10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1525769/000119312520098060/d832311d10k.htm))\n\n\\* \\[Some music\\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLTm5NlcgOw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLTm5NlcgOw))\n\n\\* A drink (at this time in the morning, it may be some coffee; that said, Fuzzy don't judge).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*2. High Score? D&amp;B Target Review\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs always, it's important to understand the entity you're considering when you're doing a breakdown like  this. So, D&amp;B run all-in-one restaurants / bars / arcades; they've got 136 locations in 39 states. That's it. Not exactly a diversified business model, but hey, whatever works. The revenue breakdown is like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Food - 28% of revenue OKAY\n\n\\* Booze - 13% of revenue WOULD HAVE THOUGHT BOOZE WOULD MAKE UP MORE AS IT'S TYPICALLY A HIGHER MARGIN IN HOSPO BUSINESSES\n\n\\* Arcade games - \\*\\*58% of revenue\\*\\*.  HOLY SHIT, THAT'S A LOT OF PINBALL. THE SPLIT HERE IS 72% TICKET GAMES ('REDEMPTION GAMES - THOSE PLAY TO WIN TICKETS THINGS LIKE WHACK-A-MOLE), 27% NON-REDEMPTION GAMES (VR, SHOOTERS, ETC) AND 1% BILLIARDS AND BOWLING. THIS IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD SPLIT AS THE REDEMPTION GAMES ARE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY - THE PRIZES YOU WIN ARE BOUGHT BY D&amp;B WHOLESALE AND PRICED THROUGH THE ROOF I.E. THE TOTAL REDEMPTION VALUE OF TICKETS WON FAR EXCEEDS THE RETAIL PRICE OF THE ITEM YOU'RE PAYING THEM FOR.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOK. So the takeaway here is that no money is coming in other than in the pockets of people who walk through the front doors of each store. Before we dive into this, let's look at why they had an earnings pop (reporting Q4 and FY 2019, \\*\\*not\\*\\* Q1 2020):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Total revenues increased 7.1% to $1.355 bn from $1.265 THAT'S A GOOD YEAR\n\n\\* Number of stores increased 12.4% to 136 from 121 AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION MEANS A LOT OF POTENTIALLY WEAK / CASHFLOW NEGATIVE OR NEUTRAL LOCATIONS\n\n\\* Comparable store sales decreased 2.6% OKAY. THESE GUYS ARE PROBABLY THE DOMINANT PLAYER IN THEIR CATEGORY ANYWAY.\n\n\\* Net FY 2019 income totaled $100.3 m, or $2.94 per diluted share (they have 34.1 million shares outstanding), vs. net FY 2018 income of $117.2 million, or $2.93 per diluted share (40.0 million shares outstanding) OKAY\n\n\\* EBITDA increased less than 1% to $280.5 million from $279.3 million LIKE I'VE EXPLAINED BEFORE, EBITDA IS NOT ACTUALLY A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF COMPANY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PERMITS IT TO BE CALCULATED. HERE, THEY TOOK (AMONG OTHER THINGS) A $7M WRITEDOWN IN EXECUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS AND A $1.183M WRITEDOWN IN ASSET DISPOSAL (EVEN THOUGH THEY ONLY CLOSED ONE LOCATION IN FY2019), AND A $20M WRITEDOWN FOR 'OTHER COSTS'. RIIIGHT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what we can see here is a business operating an aggressive expansion strategy that leases almost all of its locations and is operating on a pretty thin margin. Good earnings caused a pop on the equity price but that was for a non-corona quarter and they'd already lost 90% of the value of the shares. I wonder what effect the ol' bat flu is going to have on their business? Well, we already know they laid off 90% of their employees - let's see what else they've got planned:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\"We cannot predict how soon we will be able to reopen our stores and, as, our ability to reopen will depend in part on the actions of a number of governmental bodies over which we have no control. Moreover, once restrictions are lifted, it is unclear how quickly customers will return to our stores, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety and/or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses. Considering the significant uncertainty as to when we can reopen some or all of our stores and the uncertain customer demand environment, in addition to the actions described above, we:\n\n\\&gt;\n\n\\&gt;\u2022have begun discussions with our landlords, vendors, and other business partners to reduce our lease and contract payments and obtain other concessions;\n\n\\&gt;\n\n\\&gt;\u2022are in discussion with our lenders to obtain covenant relief to avoid events of default; and\n\n\\&gt;\n\n\\&gt;\u2022are in active dialogue with multiple potential investors to secure additional sources of financing.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds super healthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Teaching moment\\*\\*. Here's a really important part  that would be easy to skip over. Like I've explained before, when you sign up to a Credit Agreement, it comes with a lot of rules. You have to do certain things at certain times in order to keep your banks happy. If you break them, bad things happen. So when you know you're not going to be able to comply, you need to get a waiver. Anyway, one of those rules is delivering them a set of audited financials every year. Seems like D&amp;B had a preliminary conversation with their auditors that... did not go well. How can we tell? Well, in February they sought a waiver of the obligation to deliver these financials to their lenders this year. Why would they do that? The auditor's main job is to tell you that the business is capable of operating as a 'going concern'; i.e., that everything is in order and they're not about to go under. So D&amp;B wrote to their banks and asked... not to send this. They spell it out for you in the 10-K:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;While our lenders have granted a waiver of any event of default associated with receiving an auditor\u2019s report \\*\\*indicating a substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\\*\\* in connection with our year-end audit,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey go on to talk about how if they didn't get a waiver they would have had to file for Chapter 11. Now, they did get a waiver, so Ch. 11 isn't incoming, but it's important info to realize how precarious the situation of this business is. They have $\\*\\*99,000,000\\*\\* cash on hand, no revenue, continuing lease expenditures, and about $750 million debt exposure. That's..... bad. They also are getting clipped about $5.5 million a quarter on interest payments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*3. Do They Have Extra Lives? A D&amp;B Debt Breakdown\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nD&amp;B actually have a pretty basic debt structure. They currently have $266.5m outstanding under the TL (10-k, cross-ref the definition of \"Term Loan Commitments\") and the full $500m drawn under the revolver (8-k in March, cross-ref \"Revolving Credit Commitments\"). As of Feb the spread on the loans was L+150 (10-K) but the full draw on the revolver will have pushed their latest borrowings to L+200 as they've now exceeded their leverage step-downs ratios (see the definition of \"Applicable Margin\" in the Credit Agreement, cross ref definition of \"Total Leverage Ratio\"). You can calculate total leverage for $PLAY like this: \\*\\*Total funded debt\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*minus\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*cash\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*divided by\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*EBTIDA\\*\\* (see definition of \"Total Leverage Ratio\")\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe facility is maturing in Feb 2022; so they've got 18 months to pull together nearly $800 million in interest and repayments. Hmm. Sounds like they'll be needing some cash soon. Well, we know they've tapped out their revolver; so that's gone (and they couldn't draw that to repay the TL anyway as they mature at the same time plus there are restrictions on use of proceeds in the Credit Agreement for things like this). The big question here is what kind of additional debt they can incur under the facility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we discussed in our $SEAS and $F breakdowns, credit agreements permit you to go out and incur additional debt only under certain circumstances, using dedicated 'baskets' found in the negative covenants of the document. Normally these have their own dedicated section but this CA has a bit of a weird structure so they're lumped in with all the other covenants. You can find them in Section 8.7 (\\*Borrowings\\*).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe key baskets we're looking for come in three categories: (i) incremental debt (debt that can be incurred \\*outside\\* of the facility (ii) general basket debt (this is known as a 'freebie' or 'dollar' basket and is just straight up debt they can incur without getting permission from the banks (iii) ratio debt (debt they can incur when they are in compliance with a certain leverage ratio). Let's work through them one by one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Incremental Debt\\* \\\\- Let's go to Section 1.16. You can see here that they can incur \"New Term Loans\" (incremental debt) in an amount up to $\\*\\*150m + as much as they want provided they're in in compliance with a secured leverage ratio of 2.50:1.00\\*\\*. They've blown through this so we can safely say this debt incurrence is capped at $150m. There are a couple of other random more technical builders related to cash-flow sweeps and declined proceeds which I won't go into, but I'm listing them here to be complete.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*General Basket -\\* Back to Section 8. See if you can spot the general basket. It's in (k). The cap here is the greater of (i) $20 million and (ii) 10% of the EBITDA. 10% of EBITDA is bigger here, so it's about $28 million.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Ratio Basket\\* \\\\- Unlimited capacity subject to Total Leverage Ratio compliance of 3.50:1.00. They're justttttt in compliance with this so they can tap some of this basket if they wanted to. This is in section 8.07(n).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey're also dealing with a 'financial covenant' that requires them to be in compliance with a Total Leverage Ratio of 3.50:1.00 and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25:1.00. They are 99% likely to seek relief from these covenants even though they're currently in compliance (because their EBITDA is going to fall dramatically) and they indicate in the 10-K they're already exploring this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*4. $PLAY Wants The $PIPE\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we can see that $PLAY is limited in terms of its debt flexibility and they're going to need some more money to keep going. Now, earlier in the month they resisted some adverse interest from private equity buyers by adopting \\[a new shareholder rights plan (\\]([https://www.marketscreener.com/DAVE-BUSTER-S-ENTERTAIN-11659849/news/DAVE-BUSTER-S-ENTERTAINMENT-INC-ADOPTS-LIMITED-DURATION-SHAREHOLDER-RIGHTS-PLAN-30189266/](https://www.marketscreener.com/DAVE-BUSTER-S-ENTERTAIN-11659849/news/DAVE-BUSTER-S-ENTERTAINMENT-INC-ADOPTS-LIMITED-DURATION-SHAREHOLDER-RIGHTS-PLAN-30189266/))commonly known as a 'poison pill') which attempts to limit the amount of shares that can be owned by a single buyer by forcing them to pay double the market price once they reach a certain ownership threshold (here, it's 15%). This forces anyone who wants to deal with a potential $PLAY acquisition to play nice with the board rather than just try and buy up common at the discount corona-prices. Think about it like the fat friend at the bar. It's there to prevent the cute, distressed opportunity from getting into more trouble than it should. Even though $PLAY wants more cash, it wants to get it on its own terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now, $PLAY's sobered up, and, with the security blanket plan in place - surprise - they've dolled themselves up, put on their cutest outfit, and they're out trawling for investments. What they're exploring is referred to as a PIPE - public investment in private equity. This is a pretty ballsy move and its often referred to as financing of last resort because it's risky and expensive; it involves $PLAY putting together a block of preferred equity priced substantially below par, couple it with warrants or other securities, and then sell it to a single investor. This puts them in bed with that investor for a while and pisses off the common stock holders, \\*\\*but\\*\\* can have the effect of driving up price of common due to renewed interest in the long term prospects of the business (plus provides the obvious benefit of a short term cashflow injection).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason that PIPEs can provide a short term boost is because the unregistered pref shares are relatively illiquid - once the investor buys them, they're hard to trade for a little while. This indicates that (i) smart money sees a bottom in the price of the common and (ii) believes that there's long term value in the asset. This is going to be a pretty popular form of financing for the next few months given the number of distressed entities who will have difficulty refinancing their debt without exorbitant rates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said, the issue of involving yourself with PE investors who will want a say in the operation of the business is substantially different than involving yourself with hands off bankers just looking for long term returns. It's like \\[taking Greek government bonds as collateral\\]([https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-ecb-greece/update-1-greeces-borrowing-costs-fall-after-inclusion-in-ecbs-package-idUSL8N2BC3VA](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-ecb-greece/update-1-greeces-borrowing-costs-fall-after-inclusion-in-ecbs-package-idUSL8N2BC3VA)) (lol) - it's a risky business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUse your noodle and consider all your options given the above information.

        "selftext": "https://mobile.twitter.com/bespokeinvest/status/1248368169091239937\n\nThis was my statement from the very moment this selloff started. I've stayed consistent with this belief the entire time, whether we go up or down. If you just wanted any more proof, take a look at the above link. It's the same case in the recent up moves (the futures are contributing to the majority of the recent up move). \n\nRetail, institutional investors, pension funds, etc. - they don't trade overnight futures. However you know who does? Stat arb algos as well as option trading firms/hedge funds/prop trading firms/bank risk-mitigation algos. For example if a hedge fund was put into a dicey risk situation, they turn on these algos to offload risk overnight. If they can't sell credit risk, they have to do it elsewhere like in ES futures. If an option market maker is short gamma and realizes oh crap, this is gonna cause me to be super long tomorrow with this move in ES, I've gotta hedge and turn on my overnight algo to sell first so I get less long overnight. \n\nSo when you guys want to ask \"who in the world is even selling\" as we sold off and now \"who in the world is even buying\" as we go up, it's the algos. You are right, not many actual people are buying these days. It's the algos. \n\nDo you want to know why the algos are buying now? It's simple. Jerome Powell said he's buying credit ETFs. If you are a market maker, you have to sell these ETFs to them. Now you have to find a beta hedge. What's the best way to find that beta hedge? Buy ES futures. This then causes SPY to open higher. Now, if your algo was fast enough, you could have front ran the FED by buying HYG and JNK (this is why their NAV is trading at a massive premium), but if you weren't, well you get desperate as you get picked off from being short credit, so now you have to buy ES, SPY, and anything else you can. You might have to then buy SPX/SPY puts with it since you then have to protect your now new ES/SPY longs (which you didn't actually want to buy but were \"forced\" to buy),, which is why VIX hasn't dropped that much relative to how much SPY has gone up. It's all an algorithmically driven market. \n\nThis is why the entire market, on BOTH the down move and the now up move, has decoupled from the economy. So no, you guys may think people are FOMOing in. That's not true. Most investors aren't FOMOing in right now. The algos have just gone out of control on both the down and up moves and it's all technical. \n\nCorrelation (with other assets like credit and bonds), positioning (short squeeze and forced liquidations), option gamma (short gamma makes moves bigger), and short term stat arb strategies dominate the market short term. Retail and even big firms like Blackrock or Berkshire do not. Fundamentals win out long term. It may be months for SPY, and it is years for individual companies. No short term movement is ever controlled for by actual people wanting to put on a position. \n\nAs I said a month ago when we were selling off, if Citadel and Renaissance Technologies wanted to hold up the entire market for a day, they easily could. They may not want to if it's not in their favor, but they easily could. Two firms. That's enough. That about sums up this market.\n\nAnother interesting and true fact? If options trading was ELIMINATED, the market would NEVER have sold off to 220 and it would have never skyrocketed back to almost 280 now. You may ask it's the same fundamentals right? Yes it is, the fundamentals of the economy and virus are the same, but elimiate options, and actually the entire market changes.\n\nFinally, to add one more thing, if this wasn't clear, there needs to be a catalyst for the first wave of selling and buying, but everything after that is purely technical. For example, the catalysts would have been the virus and the oil shock in the wave of selling. The catalyst would have been the Fed in the wave of buying. However, the catalyst in itself shouldn't have produced a very large move. For example, imagine we go from 290 -&gt; 270 as an example. The catalyst, if only traded by itself, should have moved it from 290 -&gt; 285. However, the algos, with all the technical details I described above, then moves it from 285 -&gt; 270. This is what I call \"forced selling\" or \"fake selling,\" and I've alluded to this in my other posts. There is also \"fake buying\" in the reverse. However, \"fake selling\" is usually more powerful because on average people leverage up to be more bullish than bearish in an average market environment. So yes, the initial catalyst is important, but it's not the reason for the majority of short term moves. \n\nI worked in the industry so I know this. You can call it a dirty secret, but hopefully if you see some actual statistics (see the above link on Twitter), you'll understand too. Fundamentals eventually will win longer term, but you know that saying about how the market can stay irrational before you stay solvent, well that's literally true because the market is algo driven. And as we progress into a state of better technology and even more options volume (think about how many people just recently started trading options) and other assets, this will be more and more true. One of these days, which could be like in 20+ years,  if some black swan catalyst happens in conjunction with all of these technical factors I mentioned, you literally can see a 20% triple circuit breaker day immediately and like 90%+ of that drop would be all technical.\n\nI'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability.",

        "selftext": "A few house keeping things, first, im going to oversimplify a lot here to keep this as short as possible, if you have questions, feel free to ask.\n\nSecond, so you know im a certified autist I studied Financial Economics; my macro courses were taught by a well-respected economist who was an adviser to the Fed at the time (2014).\n\nIn short, the feds job is to manage the money supply &amp; credit while overseeing financial institutions, in times of crisis, the fed enacts appropriate monetary policy to help mitigate economic impacts.\n\nTypically, this comes in the form of repos, QE, adjusting margin/cap reserve requirements, and buying debt assets, such as Mortgage-Backed Securities, in 2008.\n\nBy increasing the money supply, the fed runs the risk of inflation if the money they inject is actually circulated (spent) and not just held in a savings account or used to provide liquidity.\n\nThe feds current policy is what I would consider as dangerous. They have entered into the debt markets, and unprecedentedly are purchasing fallen angle debt (companies that were solid, but are now junk-rated).\n\nWhy does this matter? Well, it affects the feds ability to roll back its injections of capital into the money supply. As we are entering this crisis, if many firms that the fed holds debt from default, the fed just holds that on its balance sheet and cant resell it. The same goes for MBS products. Massive defaults affect the feds ability to sell back these assets into the open markets and remove those monies from the money supply.\n\nNow, what do companies do with capital from debt purchases? Well, they spend it. In this case, mostly on payroll and other operating expenses, putting the money in circulation and not just providing it for liquidity.\n\nIf enough of the money the fed injects is actively circulated in the economy, we will see inflation, potentially on a massive scale and at the same time, if many debt assets the fed purchases go belly up and they cant sell them on the open market, it limits their ability to remove the monies from the money supply to fight inflation.\n\nThis would hinder the effectiveness of one of the biggest tools in contractionary monetary policy, reducing the money supply. So, the fed, in a case of inflation where they cant effectively reduce the money supply, will have to increase cap reserve requirements on banks, reducing how much the banks are willing to lend out for investment, causing a potentially steep economic downturn.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the feds monetary policy is aimed at helping out hedge funds, not you.\n\nMany are speculating that these massive market swings were fueled by funds being overleveraged funds with 10x, 15x even 20x leverage, which was extended by prime brokers since volatility was so low. This is a crazy amount of leverage, typically its 2x or 3x. So, the fed is essentially propping up markets to help hedge funds liquidate positions.\n\nIt is likely that once they deleverage, they will go short.\n\nAdditionally, many companies used massive leverage to buy back enough shares to artificially increase Earnings Per Share to justify executive compensation, even though revenue was largely unchanged, EPS is higher (smart, can't blame them, but they shouldn\u2019t be bailed out for it).\n\nThe fed is taking a big gamble on long term economic health to prop up markets in the short term, it may work out, and we have no economic impacts. But if it doesn\u2019t, and their models are wrong, the poor stay poor, the rich stay rich, and the middle class is decimated like my puts.\n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on how fucked we will be if the fed enters the equities market. If that happens, we are all fucked. The fed will turn into a hedge fund for the government with unlimited funds and leverage, and will no longer be the fed.\n\nTLDR; if you want to short this shit, buy leap puts on companies that cant essentially get unlimited funds from the government. For the short term, no one knows what direction the market will go since the fed will just keep announcing more capital injections until they are beyond their risk tolerance, which I imagine is soon since the balance sheet is almost 50% of GDP currently.\n\nThis is a pure economic perspective, market, and economy aren't the same, and has nothing to do with JPOW destroying all my puts\u2026.Also, long live the mouse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdits: Fixing wording, cuz I'm retarded.

        "selftext": "Hi guys. I know I won't receive definite answer, this is just post for a conversation. We all know this situation is insane. Record number of people without jobs, businesses stuggle, who knows when we will be able to travel internationally, almost everyone on the planet got involved in this COVID-19 disaster, many businesses and people will bankrupt sooner or later and yet, the market is going crazy. Biggest increase in stocks in decades in last week. Tesla went yesterday up by 13%. It's up like nothing has happened, like 80% of the things got repaired and only great days are ahead and we are ready to get back to normal. \n\nMy brain literally hurts from this. I know that INSANE amount of money were injected by the FED and central banks from all over the world, but that's gotta show somewhere. That's gotta impact the economics world somehow (at least in long run). Then you take a look at US, people without jobs, tents of homeless people all around LA, their health system (at least for me) is absolute joke and trillions of dollars will make unpleasant things dissapear and it's basically just **win-win-win** situation? Who still believe this BS? \n\nI know, by some time everything will go back to normal. As everyone panicked way too much on the stock market one month ago, now I think people are way too comfortable with the growth, they do not realize the impact of coronavirus that will take place even months from now... \n\nMaybe I'm crazy, but seeing all of this, I don't believe US market at all. It's pumped like crazy, people ignore obvious trouble just because of huge amount of helicopter money. I still think, we are in bear market (today, S&amp;P 500 is at 2761 - so if you find this in the future, you can laugh on my expense). \n\nIf you agree with some of my points, where do you invest? What does make sense? On what literature I should focus? I really do think world is changing and definitely would love to find more ideas about it (even critique of my opinions are 100% welcomed!)\n\n**What do you think about this situation on the market?**\n\nThank you for your time.",

        "selftext": "Hello, friends -\n\nIt's me, Fuzzy. I hope you're enjoying a bright and happy Easter morning wherever you are. It's espresso hour at Casa de Fuzzy, and what better way to spend it than shouting into the r/wallstreetbets void. My followers got this one last night after automod spiked it here but I'm trying again this morning.\n\nToday is going to be an uncharacteristically short post but I think it's an important one. I have noticed a lot of misinformation floating around the sub on the topic of Fed's so-called junk bond purchases. Normally I'm happy to let you dummies flail around in the dark but I've spent a fair chunk of time over the last two days going over the [term sheet](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200409a2.pdf) and frankly the number of you who are not just getting it wrong but getting it flat-earth / anti-vax / Epstein killed himself / u/pokimane shouldn't be a mod level of wrong is starting to reach critical mass, so I'm going to step in.\n\nSo. Here is a *Fun! With Finance: With Fuzzy* breakdown of what the term sheet actually permits the Fed to do. Disclaimer: This is a term sheet only, not a definitive agreement - the reality may change and honestly with this administration it probably will, but this is what we have to go on for now, so it will have to do. Ready? Here we go.  Questions permitted in the comments as always.\n\n1. The Fed **is not** authorizing the blanket purchase of junk debt (HY cash bonds). So sorry, little autist, but whatever shit company leveraged to the tits with bond debt you've got calls on probably won't be getting a short term cash injection.\n2. However, the Fed **is** authorizing the purchase of (i) certain HY ETFs and (ii) certain bonds from eligible investment grade issuers **or** HY issuers who were investment grade as of 3/22 but are no longer - key names here are $F, $OCC, $M, $CLR and $WES. Obviously the reason for this is $F. Many commenters [in my post on $F](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqk15o/fallen_angels_shitty_cars_worse_debt_and_what_it/) speculated on how the Fed might bail them out so well done to those of you who played along at home. These purchases will happen on both the primary and secondary markets.\n3. The Fed **will** purchase these eligible bonds at FMV - not at a discount.\n4. The Fed will **not** purchase shares in HY ETFs that are trading above the NAV (net asset value) of the components of the relevant fund. This goes hand in hand with the subcap on ETF investment mentioned below to indicate that ETFs are not the priority here. $HYG will bounce a little, but not a lot.\n5. The Fed purchase of HY bonds or HY ETFS is subject to several caps and limitations - (i) 20% of a HY ETF's oustanding shares (ii) 10% of an eligible issuer's outstanding bonds and (iii) 1.5% of the total facility size per individual issuer.\n6. No banks or financial institutions are eligible for the program.\n\nThere you have it. What does this mean? My take is that the total commitment of the facility **as of today** is less than 1% of the US HY debt market (it obviously could grow significantly). Your faithful correspondent thinks that as of right now, this is a targeted strike on particular entities to avoid the need for politically sensitive terms like 'bailout'.\n\nCovenant breakdowns for $LULU and $LYV and an EBITDA primer drop on r/wallstreetbets this week.",

This one leaning towards false positive tests rather than reinfection.\n\nIf this reactivation thing bears an iota of truth, I am expecting this to be a big market trigger. Imagine AIDS but you get it by breathing (Insert gay jokes here). If reactivation causes symptoms that are equally bad, imagine living with antiretrovirals (like with AIDS). If that is the case, put all your money on Gilead calls (and pharma etfs). \n\nA slightly less worrisome scenario (depending on your perspective) would be loss of immunity. Three reasons. **First**, herd immunity thesis is over. The whole going back to work after Antibody testing is over. Antibody = Not sufficiently effective or short lived. \n\n**Second**, developing a vaccine would become very hard to impossible. You did not make antibodies with the live virus with all its epitopes = longer to infinity time to get a vaccine.\n\n**Third**, makes subsequent waves more likely to erupt until most of the population is infected. Long way to go on that front. Also if you have no or lose immunity, what\u2019s the point? See first reason.\n\n**New hypothesis from comments**: Rona can also infect and kill T cells. See edits. Substantial evidence. Important because this, as far as i know, is unique to this Rona, among other beer flu viruses. \n\nThese are edge case scenarios.

Some parallels with AIDS\nApril 12 - South China post\n\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3079443/coronavirus-could-target-immune-system-targeting-protective\n\nPublished peer reviewed article in a good quality (impact factor 8, npg) journal, Cellular and Molecular Immunology: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9. 7 April.\n\n**Edit 2**: Thanks to u/fiesty-foxy. First case of reinfection in Japan. Feb 27 news report.\n\nhttps://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/24915/20200227/japan-confirms-first-case-of-reinfection.htm\n\nIf you subtract this date of news from first report of infection in Japan and add 14 days, you will get the upper bound for time lag between infections. Someone do the math! And predict the time for a future potential report from Italy/Spain.\n\n**Edit 3**: Thanks to u/zeakfury. Peer reviewed study in J of Infection (Impact factor 4.6) providing evidence for rona reactivation in ~10% of patients. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32171867/. Mar 20\n\n**Edit 4**: Thanks to u/grumpieroldman. Rona can enter T-cells the same way they enter lung cells, by interaction of their spike proteins with the ACE2 receptors in our cells. ACE2 is very little expressed on T-cells. Apparently not that of a problem for Rona. Apparently can also go into T-cells via other targets. These other targets could be good vaccine targets too. -April 7\n\nPublished peer reviewed article in a good quality (impact factor 8, npg) journal, Cellular and Molecular Immunology: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0424-9\n\n**Edit 5**: T-cell infection seems more and more convincing. May also contribute to or correlate with disease severity. Published peer reviewed article in a good quality (impact factor 8, npg) journal, Cellular and Molecular Immunology: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0401-3. Mar 17\n\n**Edit 6**: Thanks u/bigboyroy12. 8 rona strains so far. None worse than the other. Symptom variation unlikely to be due to infection by different strains. More # strains, harder it is to developing vaccines to contain all. Mar 31\nhttps://amp.usatoday.com/amp/5080571002\n\n**Track Rona strains**: https://nextstrain.org/\n\n**Edit 7**: NYT story by an epidemiologist on this very topic. Discusses the SK reinfection story. \u201cImmunity after any infection can range from lifelong and complete to nearly nonexistent. So far, however, only the first glimmers of data are available about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\u201d https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-immunity.html\n\n**Edit 8**: Not peer reviewed. Of 175 Chinese rona patients, 70% developed strong ab response, 25% low response, 5% no response. \nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365v1",

        "selftext": "Many of you are giddy at the possibility of a v shaped recovery a la Gilead's remdesivir. To burst your drug-fueled bubble, and comfort my dying putfolio, this will not save the economy in time.\n\nEven if Gilead can improve their rate of production to the optimistic timeline for at  scale production of 6-8 months, the availability will rapidly gobbled up by those nearest to death and then only to fill up stockpiles before common use. After a month of treating and finally releasing those nearest to death, they'll still have to deal with the surge of impending hospitalizations from anti maskers, and communities even more retarded than wsb. Demand for the drug will either send its price into the stratosphere, or price control measures will ensure that the drug is not available to the average retard for at least a year. \n\nThe point is that until they have a stockpile of remdesivir or a vaccine or tracking, there are no profitable movie theaters, amusement parks, air travel, etc. \n\nWhen will there be a stockpile? My complete speculation is that it will take 6-8 months (Gilead's own estimate) to make round one of production, which will not be enough to treat everyone who needs it. Keep in mind that many synthesis steps have to be done by trained professionals with at least bachelor degrees (in fucking organic chemistry jesus), so you can't just throw money at it because there's a shortage of qualified employees for this physically and mentally challenging job. It will takes months more to produce and distribute enough so that the growth in remdesivir reserves match the growth rate of the virus, and perhaps longer to surpass it. \n\nObviously some state economies will partially open before then, but many sectors with slim margins and big crowds will be hurting for the next year while pharma catches up with the virus.",

        "selftext": "What an insane week! Total profit was around $16.5k with a huge part of that due to USO. I said this before and I\u2019ll say it again, anyone shorting oil in the low $20s is absolutely brain dead. Even without the tweet oil would\u2019ve shot up to $30 soon. It doesn\u2019t matter how low supply is, when enough rigs shut down price will have to go up. Also, every piece of news was about countries begging Saudi to cut production and even logistically the Saudis need to cut due to their break even being the $70s. This is why they wanted Russia to agree to their plan to cut more during the last OPEC+ meeting. I\u2019m not sure where all these people got the info that the Saudis break even is in the teens but it is fake news and they are hurting as much if not more than everyone else. Finally, I know this sub doesn\u2019t believe in crayons but WTI hit $20 **FOUR** separate times and each time it bounced off with significant volume. \n\nThat being said I\u2019m writing more puts on USO this week when it inevitably dips. Probably try to write options on SPY and AMD since there are no fun earnings this week. Let me know what options you are writing. \n\nProof from the last week: https://i.imgur.com/5f09pNz.png \n\nThe first two option plays expired worthless. Not pictured was the WFC puts which was another $300 in profit. This screenshot is right before I sold the USO shares and bought back the calls early Friday so I missed out on the big EOD run. Total profit off of USO with all the puts, calls, and shares was 21k over the past 3 weeks.\n\n\nTLDR: Big money wants WTI above $20, I cashed in on this fact.",

Despite being right about the main points, these users are about to lose all their tendies because they have a false belief that because the IHME model is trash that the other models are much better.  I have a background in consulting, which means I'm somewhat of an expert on selling broken models while pretending they work.\n\nThere are two central issues with all all of the epidemiological models\n\n* They underestimate how effective moderate social distancing is\n* They are not accurately accounting for how much further along Italy and Spain were when they implemented social distancing or how many more cases there are in these countries\n\nFirst off, it shouldn't be understated how terrible the IHME model is.  [It is not even an epidemiological model, it's simple curve fitting based on deaths](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1247645708741566465).  Many people thought that the IHME model was underpredicting deaths even when it predicted 200k, but prior to the latest revision it's consistently over-predicted deaths and hospital shortages in the U.S. and actually continues to do so now (by much less).  The reason is that they fit Spain and Italy and...\n\n**Spain and Italy Have Lots of Corona**\n\nIf you look at [Covid19 Trackers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), it shows the US as having 3x more cases than anybody else.  We probably do have the most cases, or close to the most cases, but Spain and Italy are way closer than you might think.  On March 30, [ICL put out a report](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-30-COVID19-Report-13.pdf) estimating the number of infections for each European Countries.  They estimate on the March 28 that 15% of Spain was infected and 10% for Italy.  That means there were over 6 million cases in both Italy and Spain at the end of last month.  No wonder their hospital systems were past capacity.  Italy and Spain basically [only test old people](https://twitter.com/markwby/status/1238867143363567616/photo/1), so even though the number of cases in the US and elsewhere are vastly underreported, it's actually much worse in Italy and Spain.  This also means that models based on reported data from Italy and Spain are just as bad as models based on China, although in this case they are building in the medical system being overwhelmed.  This is because testing is unreliable, so everybody relies on deaths, and Italy and Spain have amplified deaths rates due to being overwhelmed [third world countries](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/catalonia/barcelona/articles/barcelona-airport-turned-into-rubbish-tip-after-cleaners-strike/) that are [just letting older people die](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11232070/doctors-italy-ventilators-shortage-coronavirus/).  Things aren't going to be this bad anywhere else in the world.  They've literally managed to somehow be worse than Iran where [the official advice was to oil up your buttholes](https://stepfeed.com/iranian-cleric-thinks-applying-violet-leaf-oil-to-anus-can-cure-coronavirus-5569).\n\n**Epidemiologists Can't Model Social Distancing**\n\nJust like the IHME model simply fits a curve to deaths and calls it a day; other standard models aren't much better.  The vast majority of models simply assume that everybody has an equal chance of bumping into everybody else, which is why social distancing is so ineffective.  The [Chime Model out of UPenn](http://predictivehealthcare.pennmedicine.org/2020/03/18/compare-chime.html) has a single parameter for social contact and then just make up numbers for how much various things impact chance of contact.  School Closings lower social contact by 4%, Closing all non-essential businesses by 8%.  Do you really think you bump into new people 92% as much as before with non-essential businesses closed?  The model used by the [MN Department of Health](https://mn.gov/covid19/assets/MNmodel_tech_doc_tcm1148-427724.pdf) also has a single parameter and decides that Social Distancing reduces contact by 50%, and shelter in place by 80%.  The best model is the [ICL Report](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf), which has a contact matrix that says how often you bump into people of different age groups; but even then it's just a matrix where you have an equal chance of bumping into anybody's grandma.  The  model u/bonemaster5000 says they like?  If you look at the methodology they simply say [full paper coming soon](https://covid-19.bsvgateway.org/), so we have no idea how they handle social distancing.\n\nNow, I think that social distancing has been much more effective than epidemiologists have predicted.  Why?  Because you don't bump into other people randomly.  You mostly see the same clusters of people every day, and while mild social distancing might only reduce your contact with other people by 20%, it probably reduces your contact with strangers by 90%.  If you can stop the spread across different groups of people you'll dramatically reduce the spread.\n\nIf epidemiologists knew what they were talking about then they wouldn't have flip-flopped on masks ([April 1](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/01/surgeon_general_we_do_not_recommend_you_wear_a_mask_in_regular_life.html) vs [April 4](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/some-fabrics-are-more-effective-than-others-for-making-diy-face-masks-heres-which-ones-are-best-2020-04-07)), [said that travel bans are a bad idea](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/12/21176669/travel-ban-trump-coronavirus-china-italy-europe), [wildly fluctuated in their death estimates](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/coronavirus-pandemic-ihme-model-revisions-explanation/), or [said they need 30,000 ventilators](https://nypost.com/2020/03/29/cuomo-needs-30000-ventilators-for-coronavirus-stricken-new-yorkers-fauci/) less than a week before saying [NVM 8,000 is enough](https://www.newsweek.com/new-york-governor-cuomo-says-state-has-enough-ventilators-6-days-coronavirus-patients-current-1495852).  Don't bet your tendies on nerds drawing curves.  That said, this virus isn't a hoax, it's just that it's hard to predict things that you can't rely on past data for.  This is a novel virus with interventions implemented on a scale never seen before.  You're flying by the seat of your pants on this pandemic and everything is going to be a guess at best.\n\nThat said, we know U.S. style social distancing is working because we're seeing the curve flatten in NY.  I'm not sure if we'll see a big drop in deaths or not.  There's a chance that big drop is from when the hospital system stops being overwhelmed, and if we weren't then we won't see one.  But we are nearing the worst of it in the U.S., and that's not prediction that's data.  Once the data becomes available, always trust it over predictions (except if it's Chinese data).\n\n**Why We're Still In Trouble**\n\nThis blog post by an [Economists at Chicago Booth](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2020/04/still-needed-back-to-work-plan.html) basically sums up why the U.S. is still screwed.  The U.S. got **lucky** that we're not all dying in hallways like the Italians.  We had no testing so we had no idea how far progressed this virus was.  It turns out we implemented social distancing early enough that things aren't going to get truly apocalyptic.  That said, we've still destroyed our economy, while somehow considering 60-80k deaths from the first wave a success.\n\nThe same governmental incompetence behind a lack of testing?  That's still there.  Good luck opening up.  There's no way we can implement the test-trace-isolate type programs in Singapore.  Which just had [to implement a full lockdown](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/singapore-announces-1-month-lockdown-amid-rising-corona-cases-11585905344421.html) despite having those measures.  Singapore is also currently hotter and more humid than most of the U.S. gets all summer, so don't count on the virus disappearing by itself either.\n\nWhen [Fauci says things are back to normal by November](https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/fauci-hope-to-see-real-degree-of-normality-by-november-election-81917509532), he's straight up lying to you the same as [Trump did for opening up by Easter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-easter.html).  Everybody studying this virus knows that this isn't just goingaway.  Come November we'll just be getting out of full lockdown #2.  The market is pricing in things starting to go back to normal after we open up.  [Morningstar thinks Disney Parks will open in June](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/dis/analysis).  Bad news.  After we open up, we're simply back where we were in January.  Most pandemics come in waves, [the second wave of the Spanish flu was the most deadly](https://www.history.com/news/spanish-flu-second-wave-resurgence).  There are things that help, but it's looking more and more like a miracle treatment isn't coming; otherwise we would know by now.\n\nThe first wave of the pandemic and unemployment are fully priced in now.  The next play is the failure to open up.  I'm not sure if the drop will come when they admit we can't go back to normal in mid-May or when we do go back to normal in mid-May and then see a spike in June and July.  Nobody knows, which is why it's still not priced in yet.  Definitely, by September it will be clear the U.S. is in big trouble.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nPandemic priced in.  Incompetence in reopening the economy probably not.\n\n**06/19 SPY 220 puts**\n\n**01/15/2021 SPY 180 puts**\n\n(Calendar Spreads or Debit Spreads on both of these to lower your cost basis and avoid getting screwed by Theta Gang).",

Suppliers, shipping, design, marketing etc all cancelled and the staff furloughed.\n\nThis is one example but the indexes are currently full of similar examples and some analysts are ringing the alarm bells.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Lazard Asset Management are concerned that the pandemic \u201cwill persist longer than many investors suspect and that the economic damage will be deeper and potentially longer-lasting\u201d.\n\nReddit is quick to mention that *stonks* only go up but there is some truth to that sentiment at present since *any negative factors* are dismissed as being priced in and all positive factors are heralded as a cause for stocks to rally.  If priced in was accurate then we would not see record-beating market rallies back to back.  10% volatility swings over 48 hours is the very definition of *not priced in.* \n\nThere is evidence to suggest that, well, the bullish sentiment is wrong and mainly because it is [retail investors being taken for a ride](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-stock-market-investors-buy-the-dip-80ae288d-619b-487a-acbd-8409c05db52d.html) whilst funds re-balance and offload. \n\nRetail traders \"buying the dips\" is normally a contrarian signal, meaning that it's time to sell. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What does this have to do with the trailing 10 year dividend?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMajor indexes are comprised of stocks that [pay handsome dividends](https://www.dividendinvestor.com/the-sp-500-dividend-yield-a-historical-analysis/); normally 2% yield a year. The companies have reached their limit of growth (HSBC haven't discovered 5 million new customers and Shell are not finding new fossil fuels) so investors hold the stock for **income-seeking reasons**.  \n\nThe FTSE 100 was priced in to generate \u00a389 billion in dividends for 2019 and \u00a390 billion+ in 2020.  That has largely collapsed.  \n\nThe only companies that pay dividends are those taking on debt to do so like Shell.  And they have; [a 10Bn credit line to maintain dividends](https://www.ft.com/content/ee832198-024b-4a0f-a61d-de767a1e6d6c).  The Bank of England[had to slap 5 UK banks](https://www.ft.com/content/c13d3d21-b6f3-4449-a916-2ba4271818e4) from issuing dividends at this time.  That means that their primary valuations as income-generating stocks are questionable...\n\n...especially since the dividends are not expected to return to the 2020 levels for another 10 years now.\n\n# \n\n# Onto the S&amp;P\n\nIn 2021 the market expects the dividends per share for the S&amp;P to be reduced to $38 per share.  That is priced in and common knowledge.\n\nThat is a 41% drop from the recent highs of $63 a share and seems alarming for income seeking investors since we are not expected to recover to those prices for 8-10 years.\n\nBut DataTrek have noted that **we are still currently trading at 21X** the trailing 10 year earnings of $122 a share.\n\nDividends per share normally don't fall as far as earnings per share.  But they are inverted at present. \n\nFor the S&amp;P to be trading at 2,650 level (or even higher) it means the market does not believe the pandemic or recession will have any long-term damage.  That puts us squarely at odds with items 3 and 4 in our list of factors needed to exit a bear market.\n\nIn other recessions, including 2008, the S&amp;P traditionally pulled back to 10X a share for trailing 10 year average.  That would mean *halving* the current value of the S&amp;P.\n\nIn actual fact, during the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bear market; the dividends per share dropped by a lower percentage amount than the ***total index value drop***.  The market drop was approximately 1.5X what the dividend per share drop was.\n\nRight now, we have the reverse.  Dividend share drop is 41% and market drop was approximately 30% and rallying heavily back to 18% only.  That makes no financial sense unless the assets were being propped by buyers...\n\nIf the S&amp;P truly does pull back to the equilibrium price of 10X, as has happened in previous recessions, then we would expect to see levels of around $1200 at the bottom but that seems extremely bearish.\n\nIf previous indications hold true, then we would expect the S&amp;P to drop by approximately 50-60%ish at the true bottom to reflect the 41% decrease in expected shares plus additional discounts and negative market sentiment.\n\nIn reality, we are probably likely to pull back to between 13X and 15X trailing average which puts the S&amp;P between 1600 and 1800.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TL:DR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 2 out of the 4 necessities for exiting a recession are not present\n* S&amp;P currently trading at 21X the trailing 10 year average dividend\n* In previous recessions the index pulls back to 10X the average trailing dividend\n* In previous recessions the dividend per share drop is *less* than the overall index drop\n* At present the S&amp;P dividend per share drop is 41% but the S&amp;P is rallying back to less than 20% drop...whilst dividends are not expected to return to 2019 levels of income for 8-10 years\n* S&amp;P highly overvalued, completely inverted when compared with dividend expectation and market dividend pricing\n* S&amp;P pull back to 1600-1800 over short-medium time frame (1 month-6 months). \n* If market history is to be believed then 1200 is not unfeasible based on percentages\n* If S&amp;P continues to rise then it indicates companies are taking on debt or other instruments to pay dividends rather than innovate, upgrade or consolidate their business position.\n\n# Why is bullish sentiment so wrong? \n\nThe negative reports are so wildly negative that the almost defy belief.  We are dealing with insane numbers way beyond our traditional frame of reasoning. This is topped only by the insanity of the scale of quantitative easing.  Less than a year ago, a small movement in the non-farm payrolls would lead to a 2-3% move in the markets; now we are hitting 700K jobs lost, a truly ugly number and the market rallies hugely. Future economic students will study this to try and understand what was happening. \n\nIn the space of *weeks* the majority of the Western economies have swung to being effectively state-sponsored, centralised economies and no one really knows how to unwind these positions.  \n\nIt is impossible to reconcile being a bull with a centralised state economy and blue-chip stocks that refuse to pay dividends but the share price remains at the same levels as when they paid a 2% yield.",

        "selftext": "First and foremost I am an average investor. Nothing fancy, and around half a year of options experience and I am also very bearish. Technical analysis obviously has some truth to it, it's a tool to allow more accurate decision making but is not an oracle which is why I wanted to question one of the points that continuously get brought up - **volume**. Before the black swan event SPY traded at 50million average, now it's at around 130 million average. Given that there hasn't been extreme bearish news lately, wouldn't it be normal for SPY to be trading at a lower volume? The way I see it SPY shouldn't have increased volume unless there is a reason to, for example - a large GDP decrease, unexpected terrible earnings, a major country going under a 2nd lockdown, mass bankruptcy or extending lockdowns even further. I do believe DOW will decrease in the future but unless a major event happens, I don't see why SPY would gap down a lot within 2-6 weeks since there is also a good chance none of those examples will happen in that timeframe. Insight would be much appreciated.  \n\n\nIWM 7/17 100P, SPY300 5/15",

Zoom had about 10 million free and paid users by the end of December last year, it said earlier this month.\n\n\"We recently experienced the most significant growth our business has ever seen, requiring massive increases in our service capacity,\" said Eric Yuan, Zoom's chief executive. \"We chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure because of its industry-leading security, outstanding performance, and unmatched level of support.\"\n\nZoom's operations have gained attention during the pandemic as users sheltering in their homes signed up for the video platform to connect with coworkers, family and friends. More than 212,000 people have died and 3.06 million have fallen ill from the respiratory disease.\n\nThe stock has surged 134% this year as the outbreak grew, although the shares were 2.8% lower on Tuesday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite turned lower.\n\nYuan said earlier this month it was shifting engineering resources to trust, safety and privacy issues after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it received reports of video conferences being interrupted by hate images, pornography and threats. Last week, Zoom released an upgrade to its program that included \"robust security enhancements.\"\n\nZoom said it's now enabling \"millions\" of meeting participants on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which will help it meet the changing demands of a growing customer base.\n\n\"Video communications has become an essential part of our professional and personal lives, and Zoom has led this industry's innovation,\" said Safra Catz, Oracle's chief executive.\n\nPrice: 159.30, Change: -5.30, Percent Change: -3.22",

Small businesses are laying off left and right. PAYX gets its revenue as small businesses pay them a fee every pay period to distribute paychecks to employees. And PAYX is overwhelming exposed to the small business sector. SQ is down a lot more than PAYX even though these two companies are in the same space. Look at SQ and PAYX one month charts in your shitty Robinhood viewer. SQ down 42% and this shitty payroll processor is down 22%. Doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out people on unemployment don\u2019t get paychecks. \n\nI\u2019m in for 2 contracts\n$45p 6/17 \nand getting order in for two more \n$45p 9/18",
