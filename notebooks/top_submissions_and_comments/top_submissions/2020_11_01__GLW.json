        "selftext": "I am a fairly new and learning investor (3 years in) and also a college student who is looking to graduate. I have a 40K total portfolio filled with mostly low risk and dividend paying companies, and a couple higher risk as I am a young investor. It consists of MSFT, CSCO, CNQ, TRP, ENB, CAE, SNC, NIO, GLW, CNR, CARR, and BPY. \n\nI am looking to open new positions in PLTR and BNS, and was also keeping an eye on Well.to.\n\nI will be graduating with quite a bit of student loans to pay back (25K) and so I was looking for advice on taking on higher risk in my portfolio. Perhaps for quicker gains as I still have my high dividend stocks giving me passive income. Any suggestions on my existing stocks and on other higher risk/high growth potential companies to keep an eye on?",
