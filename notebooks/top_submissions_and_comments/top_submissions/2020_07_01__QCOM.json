(HMC), and (2) Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit Design Co., Ltd (Hygon)\n\nBut in a Trade War, this can be a problem, especially if there is a trade embargo in place, this can affect production. We also saw AMD price crumble during this time. As CHINA and the US intesifies AMD will be a dangerous stock to hold unless it cuts ties with its Chinese partners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 4\n\n\\##############\n\nIntel Desktop market share\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-vs-intel-cpu-market-share-q4-2019-epyc-and-ryzen-growth-decelerate-mobile-ryzen-up](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-vs-intel-cpu-market-share-q4-2019-epyc-and-ryzen-growth-decelerate-mobile-ryzen-up)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMD desktop market share is 18.3%\n\nIntel desktop market share is said to be greater than 66%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMD Server Unit Market Share is said to be 5%\n\nIntel Desktop market share is said to be 80%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis market is worth around 23billion\n\nQuote: [https://marketrealist.com/2019/08/why-is-intel-optimistic-about-its-data-centric-businesses/#adnrb=900000](https://marketrealist.com/2019/08/why-is-intel-optimistic-about-its-data-centric-businesses/#adnrb=900000)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 5\n\n\\#################\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe future\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nINTEL IS AHEAD OF AMD IN 5G, which is the future.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/intel-future-in-5g-networks-after-apple-buys-modem-business.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/intel-future-in-5g-networks-after-apple-buys-modem-business.html)\n\n[https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/5g-network-portfolio-launch/#gs.b6cjry](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/5g-network-portfolio-launch/#gs.b6cjry)\n\n  AMD is well behind here;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntel is optimized for AI building their chips for machine learning.\n\nEveryone knows that is the future and is getting bigger.\n\n[https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai.html](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are also working on 7nm, 5nm, and smaller size cpus\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 6\n\n\\#################\n\nintel is more than just cpu's\n\nThey produce Network cards and have one of the biggest shares.\n\n[https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/network-io/ethernet.html](https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/network-io/ethernet.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntel have storage solutions in place\n\n[https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/docs/storage/storage-products.html](https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/docs/storage/storage-products.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey provide chips for motherboards and gpu's\n\nAMD just produce cpu's and graphics cards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 7\n\n\\###########\n\nEveryone knows that employees are the most important thing in companies.\n\nCompanies with bigger budgets can hire the best of the best.\n\nintel = 110,200\n\namd = 11,400\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOINT 8\n\n\\###########\n\nINTEL is a trusted brand, most companies are providing laptops and desktops in corporate offices with intel inside.\n\nThey have hardware contracts in place for decades.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWHAT DOES AMD HAVE ON INTEL\n\n\\#################\n\n6 MONTHS DEVELOPMENT advantage on 7nm and 5nm chips.\n\nMost likely because that is all amd do and even with that competitive advantage, Intel still has greater market\n\nshare and makes more money",

        "selftext": "Look, you may notice that Intel have a few bad days since they say they are gonna outsource their production (Which should be bullish since Amd, Qualcomm, apple,Nvda are all doing it anyway, so I don't know why it drops that hard)\n\nA recent bill has passed where US would try to boost semiconductors production in the US by credits and tax cuts which are useless since overseas production are way cheaper.\n\nhttps://asiatimes.com/2020/07/intel-is-making-a-mockery-of-reshoring/\n\nIntel has been retarded in recent years since they are the only large chip manufacturer still makes in the US, no large companies does that anymore and is way cheaper to make from TSMC or Samsung.\n\nBut currently the US want more home made chips but yet big boy Intel is gonna leave.\n\nSo, Either way it seems that Intel could win if they outsource their chips to TSMC and could outproduce AMD while they may also have support from the government since they are last large chip maker in the US.\n\nDo you think congress would even up their game by potentially having traiffs on chips made from outside?",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/here-comes-one-of-the-newsiest-and-most-critical-weeks-of-the-summer-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; In a summer of unending news, we may be heading into what could be the newsiest week of all.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq\u2019s sputtering rally could be put to its biggest test yet, as tech bellwether Apple and other stalwarts of the tech rally report earnings. Early in the week, Republicans will unveil their stimulus package proposal, which will then be debated as Friday\u2019s deadline nears for the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve also meets on and is likely to discuss other steps it can take. It\u2019s not likely, however, to make any moves as it wraps up on Wednesday, other than to assure markets it will continue to use extraordinary programs to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Then on Thursday, the government will release a big number many investors have been dreading \u2014 the first official reading of second quarter gross domestic product, which which should show how hard the economy crashed when it was abruptly shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect a contraction of about 35% in the second quarter, followed by a bounce back in the third quarter. But the size of that comeback could be directly impacted by how much stimulus Congress gives the economy, and how much the coronavirus continues to impact businesses and economic activity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s a clear understanding of how much the economy has leaned on the crutch of government stimulus, both fiscally and monetarily,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cEveryone will be watching for what will replace the $600 a week, and that will be the most important component of whatever plan they come up with.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The $600 weekly payment to about 30 million unemployed Americans expires Friday, and it is unlikely Congress will have a plan before that date. Strategists expect the amount to be cut in half, and Boockvar said the amount of that payment will directly impact the size of the boost to the economy\n*****\n&gt; The stimulus and tech earnings could both be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat the package looks like will be a huge deal, particularly on the unemployment benefits side, and whether tech companies can exceed the bar,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cThat\u2019s very hard for them right now. So if they miss, does that mean it\u2019s going to be a negative for tech and not the whole market? Are we going to keep rotating to value from growth because tech has been so dominant it could take everything down?\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to decline by 40.3% for the second quarter, based on the results of companies that have already reported and estimates, according to Refinifiv\u2019s I/B/E/S. Technology earnings are expected to have one of the smallest profit declines, at just 4.4% on average.\n*****\n&gt; The Nasdaq, which had rallied to record highs this summer, ended lower for a second week, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings numbers overall, they\u2019ve been pretty good. It\u2019s just the basic problem with the stock market right now is that valuations are still pretty high,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cOther parts of the market that maybe look cheap on a price-to-book basis, their earnings have been hit. In the case of certain retailers, airlines, you have to worry about when their business is going to come back, if ever.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 80% of the companies already reporting have beaten Wall Street estimates. That is well above the average beat rate of about 65%, since 1994.\n*****\n&gt; Dozens of major companies report in the coming week, including Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly are expected to report, and consumer products names Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and Procter &amp; Gamble also release results. Big oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report Friday.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus from Congress and the Fed\n&gt; Strategists expect Congress to ultimately adopt a new stimulus package of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, but after the GOP plan is introduced it will have to be squared with Democrats\u2019 proposals. The House has its own $3 trillion spending plan. It is unlikely an agreement can be approved before unemployment benefits expire Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBipartisan negotiations between the White House, House, and Senate are officially underway, but we expect brinkmanship before passage. Trump administration officials also diverge on their expectations on timing, which remains optimistically by the end of July, and possibly stretching into August under the more \u2018realistic\u2019 case,\u201d writes Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills expects the $600 weekly payment to be cut to $300 or $400, and he said it\u2019s possible there would be more funds given to a Payroll Protection Program, to help small businesses.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOverall, momentum is building for the next package and the final price tag is arguably moving up (closer to $1.5 -2 trillion),\u201d Mills noted. Congress has already allocated $2.4 trillion in prior spending.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed will be discussing its own stimulus, and some economists expect it could again be talking about new tactics to keep interest rates low. One idea is a policy of forward guidance, where the Fed would steer market expectations more explicitly. Another is the Fed would use targeted Treasury purchases to control specific interest rates. But no new programs are expected to be announced.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey pretty much told us, they\u2019re all in. They told us they\u2019re willing to do whatever else it takes,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThe Fed is not going to be our problem. The Fed just told us they\u2019re going to do anything they can do to soften the blow from the virus.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/rshk3gVX/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6nsD6FQ/marketdata3.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/nrVx3NtG/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/NLhf0Rdn/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmb01rb/marketdata1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/vBhFxX6g/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Jn6YWFkq/marketpullbacklevels1.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/85PX9Gjc/maketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C57tdKXj/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/HknGcQpj/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsD5HPX2/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/Nfgvt3S6/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week\n\n&gt; The earnings slate continues to ramp up next week with 712 total companies scheduled to report. In the table below, we show the largest stocks by market cap that are set to report quarterly results. On Monday, there will be no company with a market cap above $100 billion reporting with the largest companies being Alexandria Real Estate (ARE) and multiple banks. On Tuesday, payment processor Visa (V) will be out with earnings in addition to Pfizer (PFE), Amgen (AMGN), McDonald's (MCD), and Raytheon (RTX). Visa has historically averaged the strongest stock price reaction to earnings of these names but it has gapped down for six straight quarters. That will be followed by another payment processor, Paypal (PYPL) on Wednesday. In addition to Paypal, Facebook (FB) is also scheduled to report that same day. While both stocks have averaged over 2% gains on earnings days historically, ServiceNow (NOW) has seen an even stronger performance with an average gain of 3.64%. Another major earnings report that will be widely watched is Boeing (BA) to get a gauge on how demolished travel demand has affected the company. On Thursday, three of the world's largest stocks will also be out with earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG). Each one has averaged a 1%+ gain on earnings days. Apple (AAPL) has seen some of the strongest results in recent history with last quarter snapping a streak of four consecutive triple plays. On Friday, two of the largest energy stocks, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), will round out the week and July's earning calendar. Both stocks have historically averaged declines on earnings days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Earn3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dollar Weakness May Continue\n\n&gt; The US dollar was remarkably strong during the first quarter of 2020, benefitting from the flight to safety and rallying to nearly a 10% year-to-date gain at the stock market\u2019s low point on March 23. However, as equity markets have recovered, and the US has continued to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the dollar has given up nearly all of those gains. We think this trend may continue, and if so, it would have important implications for a range of asset classes.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a more diversified basket than the commonly cited DXY Index, is nearing a critical uptrend line. A break of this support could mean that weakness seen over the past few months is more than just an unwinding of the flight to safety. Through Wednesday, the index was down more than 1% for the week and tracking toward its fourth straight weekly loss.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t just a technical story though. As we explored last month, rising twin deficits have historically been followed by a weaker dollar, meaning the fundamentals support this move as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/July-23-picture.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The commodity rally is another reason to believe the market may be looking toward a weaker dollar. Commodities are typically viewed as having an inverse relationship with the dollar since the dollar is effectively the denominator of a hard asset. Gold prices are up more than 20% year to date, copper just traded to its highest level in more than two years, and silver prices have appreciated 28% this month alone.\n\n&gt; As for the implications of a weaker dollar, according to LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, \u201ca weaker US dollar may be a slight negative for US consumers\u2019 buying power, but for investors\u2019 portfolios the implications are overwhelmingly positive. Commodities are rallying, US multinational companies benefit from foreign buyers being able to afford more of their goods, and international stocks do well as their underlying currencies appreciate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Recent history bears this out. The last calendar year that saw a significant dollar decline was 2017 when the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell more than 8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index rallied more than 19% on a price return basis; however, international stocks fared even better. The MSCI EAFE Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 22% and 34%, respectively, and 2017 represented the only year since 2012 that either outperformed the US.\n\n*****\n\n# Silver Gets the Gold for YTD Performance\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we took a look at the massive rallies of late in the precious metals space. Gold (GLD) reached its highest level since 2011, but silver's (SLV) performance on the day was even more of a sight to behold with gains in the top 1% of all days since SLV began trading in 2006. Silver (SLV) rose 6.15% for its best day since March 24th when the metal rose 7.96%. Whereas the silver to gold ratio has been in a constant downtrend over the past decade (indicating underperformance of silver relative to gold), yesterday's big gains led to a breakout of this downtrend. With SLV trading higher by over 5% yet again this morning, that downtrend is being broken even more significantly, and that is even with SLV off the pre-market highs above $21.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD.png))**\n\n&gt; As recently as the final days of June, SLV was actually sitting on a loss year to date. That was a far cry from the performance of some of the best-performing assets of the year at the time like the Tech heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) which was up over 14% and the long term Treasuries ETF (TLT) which was up over 21.5%. Silver's yellow cousin, gold, was likewise sitting on a sizeable gain of 16.6%. Pivot ahead to today and the picture is very different. Around this morning's premarket highs when SLV was trading above $21, it actually topped QQQ, TLT, and GLD as the best performing asset in 2020. That is even with each of these other ETFs also trading higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072220-SLV-GLD2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hot Julys Often Bring Late-Summer/Autumn Buys\n\n&gt; Despite persistent pandemic setbacks, bleak economic and corporate numbers, geopolitical tensions, civic unrest and a knock-down, drag-out election battle, the U.S. stock market has proven rather resilient. After suffering the shortest bear market in history that lasted only 40 days the velocity and strength of the V-shaped rally off the March 23 bear market low has been impressive.\n\n&gt; Massive fiscal stimulus, the return of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), vaccine promise and the boon of the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d economy have sent the market higher again here in July with NASDAQ tacking on new all-time highs, though the Dow and S&amp;P 500 continue to struggle. As of yesterday\u2019s close this put DJIA up 4.6%, S&amp;P 500 up 5.7% and NASDAQ up 6.4% for the month of July at yesterday\u2019s close, qualifying this as a \u201cHot July Market\u201d.\n\n&gt; Gains of this magnitude for July, however, have frequently been followed by a late-summer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past, full-month July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of -7.2% on average (-4.7% median decline) in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year. The low in 2018 came a bit late, but it was just 2 days into winter. There were also prior lower prices in late October and November.\n\n&gt; Climbing COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths have forced rollbacks and pauses of economic reopening plans and travel restrictions. Coupled with an uptick in jobless claims and other troublesome economic readings and forecasts as well as elevated valuations, exuberant sentiment, technical resistance and seasonal weakness, stocks are ripe for a pullback. Today\u2019s selloff: case in point. This will likely set up a great buy as the $13+ trillion flows through the global economy into US stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8b02cd9a08b7fedd5996d544420d9cd8/cb70e70b199ba14d-04/s500x750/c8010183a653633c81747813512c8c74ed5214a2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$EBAY** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$AZN** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$CNC** \n&gt; * **$MO** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$GOOG** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$GILD**\n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$DXCM** \n&gt; * **$ABCB** \n&gt; * **$BUD** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$LRCX**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/fRgk0Fb6/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/kg5BG97Q/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR MONDAY, JULY 27TH, 2020!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZR2gdg5q/eram01.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8D2LRQ6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/C6Upp8Y.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/O5wY9g7.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MjSLIaQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EictqLG.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XGrwuKt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HMjc0WJ.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/0hMH94x.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vFJ1WH4.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7otjSsD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/7g6UICu.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FKHIibS.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/l21kL5q.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rrBxXn7.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/X4senHx.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KqxX8LC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3l48OVf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0VTb4f4.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.31.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

        "selftext": "Quick rundown if you've been living under a rock, Apple announced a while back that they will release a macbook line that works on Apple's very own silicone chips, AKA SoCs\\* (like how their phones, tablets, and watches run on apple's A series chips like the A13). \n\n(\\*SoC, or System on Chip is just short way of saying chip that integrates most components of a computer, like a gpu and cpu in one)\n\n* Now, its common belief that the Apple Silicone chips for the new macbooks will allow the machine to perform far better than a macbook running on intel. \n* Its also common belief that producing and implementing these chips will be cheaper for Apple than buying and integrating intel's own chips.\n* Another important thing to note is that Apple states that they will be introducing a family of SoCs , meaning there could likely be various macbook silicone chips of varying performance.\n* Apple states that it will take at least two years to complete the transition from intel to their own chips, its very likely that apple will continue to sell new macbooks running on intel alongside ones that run on their in house chips.\n\nI tried researching what the possible pricing of the new macbooks could be but every article just assumes the new line of macbooks will be cheaper than their intel counterparts (usually by $100). The reasoning is always \"bro its like... cheaper to make, uh... more power (something, something, macmini devkit only using a A12x)... ARM TECHNOLOGY... therefore cheaper\", usually a bunch of incoherent tech babble. I've been thinking about it and I honestly believe it makes no sense for apple to sell their in house chip macs at a cheaper price than their intel macs. If the in house chip macs really do end up performing better than the intel macs, and supposedly the price of the in house model is cheaper, no one would buy the intel macs. Now I know you're saying \"yuh, thats the point\", but as stated earlier the transition between chips is supposed to take a while. Apple still plans to sell and produce intel macs during that time, and if no one is buying those intel macs, thats money lost for them. But here's another thing, It's likely that apple is planning on taking two years to transition likely because they don't have the manufacturing speed or supply chain fully ready to entirely replace intel chips on their machines. Now, this is where the family of SoCs come in. It's possible that apple will make chips that run on par with their intel counterparts and sell both machine lines alongside each other at the same price. Or they could implement some software solution to just gimp their chips too, I think they did something similar with their phones a while back in regards to their LTE modem chips, allegedly the qualcomm chips were gimped by apple to perform on the same level as the intel chips. Either way I'm sure they get to keep their possibly higher profit margins on the in house macs over the intel ones. But i wanna know what you guys think on the possible pricing and margins, i was really just rambling here.",

        "selftext": " By [Vitaliy Katsenelson](https://contrarianedge.com/teslas-stock-price-discounts-temporal-wormhole-into-the-future/)\n\nTesla\u2019s market capitalization just crossed $300 billion. It\u2019s the largest car maker in the world, even larger than Toyota, which produced almost nine million cars in 2019 and had a market capitalization of $200 billion. Tesla market cap implies that the market believes that its production will go up more than 20-fold from the 400,000 cars a year it produces today to \u2026 ten million cars.\n\nAs the market valuation of Tesla raced to the moon, its debt rating remained as junk (Toyota is A+, GM is BBB). The largest automaker in the world is junk-rated.\n\nIn the past I have made the analogy that the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) cars to electric motors is akin to the transition from dumbphones to smartphones. It\u2019s a domain shift. So maybe another domain shift will bring higher margins to Tesla, as happened for Apple with the iPhone. Unlike other car makers, Tesla is vertically integrated: It manufactures most of the components that go into its cars (including seats); thus gains from the economies of scale that used to accrue to its suppliers will accrue to Tesla.\n\nAlso, software plays a bigger role in a Tesla than in a traditional car. There is self-driving, over-the-air updates, and an iPad-like interface that powers all the controls, for starters. So if advanced software helps Tesla get higher margins than traditional car companies, it may not have to make as many cars to get to Toyota\u2019s profitability. Bulls would even argue that self-driving alone may send Tesla\u2019s margins to the moon. I\u2019d like to pour cold water on that argument: Full autonomous driving is a good decade away. (I discuss it in great detail [here](https://contrarianedge.com/signup-for-tesla-article/), in my 37-page Tesla writeup).\n\nMost importantly, going from 400,000 cars to \u2026 many millions a year is not an easy nor a cheap journey. The market confuses Tesla with other Silicon Valley tech companies. Yes, Tesla is much more a technology company than your typical ICE car company is. It creates its own software and even the microprocessor that powers self-driving, but it still cannot escape the reality that it has to bend a lot of metal to produce its electric cars.\n\nUnlike Facebook, which a decade ago could increase its user base ten- or- twenty-fold by spending a few hundred million dollars on data centers, Tesla will require an incredible amount of capital to increase production many-fold . To produce fewer than half a million cars, as it does today, Tesla needed a $25 billion investment in property, plants, and equipment. This is where bits meet atoms and face financial gravity. Tesla is barely breaking even today and will need to raise and invest not just tens of billions but hundreds of billions of dollars to increase its production enough to grow into its current valuation.\n\nAnd then there is an element of time. Tesla has been stuck at producing 90,000 cars for the last eight quarters. It can only blame the coronavirus for a quarter or two. Getting to an annual production of even a few million cars will require time \u2013 a lot of time. A lot of dirt has to be moved, permits issued, equipment installed, people hired.\n\nIn Star Trek there are convenient wormholes, which cut corners through space, getting you to that galaxy a billion light years away in hours. Low interest rates have messed with the temporal properties of the market and created a wormhole in time and in Tesla\u2019s stock (as well as in many other stocks \u2013 I talked about them [here](https://contrarianedge.com/nifty-faang-and-other-one-decision-investment-strategies/)). It will take years, maybe even a decade, for Tesla to produce enough cars to justify its valuation. Today\u2019s market valuation assumes it has already happened \u2013 that the capital has been raised and spent and that it cost nothing.\n\nA few additional thoughts on ICE makers.\n\nWhat is interesting to me is that today the market is basically valuing ICE makers as melting ice cubes (pardon the pun). It tacitly assumes that they won\u2019t be able to transition to electric vehicles, and so it values only their ICE cash flows, giving them basically no terminal value for their businesses.\n\nTransitioning from one domain to another is incredibly difficult \u2013 your assets turn into liabilities. Even your knowledge in the old domain is often a liability in the new one. Just imagine being the best horse carriage maker in 1910 and making cars at the same time. Your horse carriages still provide huge cash flows. You still have to come up with new, better horse carriages and market and advertise them. But you know that at some point in time that business will be worth zero. This is the feeling I got when Chevy introduced its new Corvette. This is yet another topic I explore in great depth in my [37-page writeup](https://contrarianedge.com/signup-for-tesla-article/).\n\nOne route that might save the ICE industry is the standardization of the hardware that goes into cars. Think of smartphones. Most of the parts that go into them are standardized. The memory that goes into iPhones and Android phones is the same; so are the batteries, sensors, microprocessors. (Apple develops its own, but most Android phones are powered by microprocessors designed by Qualcomm or Samsung). Software, too: All Android phones, which are 80% of all smartphones globally, run software created by Google. This standardization of components brings costs down substantially. Imagine if every smartphone manufacturer had its own version of everything that goes into a smartphone.\n\nNow think about ICE car companies today. The only parts that are standard among cars are the tires and batteries (thank god!). All other parts \u2013 engines, transmissions, running gear \u2013 are basically custom to each manufacturer and each brand. (Toyota parts may or may not work in a Lexus.)\n\nThe best way to drive down costs of EVs is to borrow the standardization approach from the smartphone industry. That\u2019s the right answer for the industry \u2013 EV costs would decline tremendously \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure car companies can bend their thinking that far without plunging into an identity crisis. If car companies don\u2019t design the parts or even the software that go into their EVs, then what are they? Marketers? Assemblers? Designers?\n\nTesla doesn\u2019t have this identity crisis to grapple with. Nor does it have to make horse carriages while it is working on new cars.\n\nThere are several significant differences between phones and cars, thus requiring a tweak to my dumbphone/smartphone analogy.\n\nFirst, cars cost a lot more than phones. A few-hundred-dollar difference in dumbphone vs. smartphone does not impact consumer behavior that much. Thousands of dollars do. The functionality of EVs and ICE cars is not much different \u2013 they both get you from point A to point B. Thus EVs (and especially their batteries) have to come down in price to be a truly attractive alternative to ICE cars. Lower maintenance and fuel savings are good carrots, but they come in the future years of ownership, while paying a higher price is up-front.\n\nSecond, because functionality is so similar, most consumers driving ICE cars do not know what they are missing.\n\nWhich brings me to the final point: The replacement cycle for phones is a year or two, but for cars it is about twelve years. Thus the transition to EVs will be gradual, giving ICE carmakers time to adjust.\n\nWhen I wrote [my Tesla analysis](https://contrarianedge.com/signup-for-tesla-article/) I opened it with this quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald: \u201cThe test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.\u201d You can see that analysis of Tesla and the automotive industry today requires holding a lot of opposing ideas, including that Tesla\u2019s stock price depends on Elon\u2019s ability to maintain a temporal wormhole.\n\nDisclosure: I own a Tesla Model 3 and love it; I have a small position in Tesla puts in case the temporal wormhole collapses.",
