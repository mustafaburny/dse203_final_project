        "selftext": "So many ppl lost money in all the tickers, cause we retails are divided by the hedgies, look what happen with GME and AMC.  We won because we are focus. I have cashed out all my earnings to all in on PSFE because the exact same scenario is happening. I all in in GME at 30 and it rose to 300. I've put my capital in AMC at 3 and it rose to 70. PSFE is the next GME, igaming revenue up 70%, transactional volume up 41%, no pipe is selling but stocks tank to 7 from 19.\n\nRecently I bought in affirm at 60, when it got shorted down from 100, good news happened and it rose 100%. We all want the next AMC and I am quite certain PSFE is the next. It monopolize Canada's igaming market by having a 100% share and 75% share in the US. All of the big betting players are a client of PSFE.\n\nNone of the pipe has sold here, bill foley with 30m shares, dan loeb with 41m shares. Blackrock just bought in at 8.3m shares at $12. This will explode soon. Shorts are trapped with &gt;10% float just like AMC was when it was at $8.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09EV/Rev ratio : $83.91EV/FCF ratio : $87.86Average: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :\u00a0$50.75EV/Rev ratio :\u00a0$44.64EV/FCF ratio :\u00a0$44.18Average : $46.52\n\n\\- Paysafe Powers Online Payments for Montana Lottery\u2019s Sportsbook\n\n\\- Paysafe Streamlines Payments for Interactive Wagering With Fubo Gaming in US\n\n\\- bunq Partners With Paysafe to Enable Cash Deposits for Digital Banking\n\n\\- Paysafe Expands Betfred USA Sports Partnership Through Income Access Deal\n\n\\- Paysafe Completes Acquisition of PagoEfectivo\n\n\\- Paysafe to Acquire viafintech\n\n\\- Paysafe to Acquire SafetyPay\n\nPaysafe acquire these companies in cash unlike Square and Paypal with stocks. These means the shareholders and board think its undervalued. Many of the buyers are stucked in at $12. I am in at $9 with 35k shares. Affirm has 2x since. I bought AMC at $12 sit to $5 and rose to $60.\n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own DD. But this just might be the next netflix. :)",

        "selftext": "Paysafe (PSFE)\n\nHave you Apes been missing the news lately on a stock that is one of us?  Why? Paysafe is a leading supporter of online gaming and the deals recently announced are not priced into the stock.  If anyone should be supporting gambling it is us?\n\nIt\u2019s has a high potential of being bought\u2026\n\n\u201cThe Bottom Line\n\nSomeone is going to buy this company.\n\nProcessors are looking for growth and innovation. They\u2019re all focused on Square (NASDAQ:SQ), which has only grown more popular as it has gone into various banking and investment niches.\n\nGambling doesn\u2019t scare the payments industry. Casino contracts are highly prized. Processors don\u2019t hand gamblers money they don\u2019t have. When the gambler is out of money, they reject the transaction. Many casinos have special rules for gambler transactions aimed at keeping them, and the gamblers, out of trouble.\n\nThis means the downside risk of PaySafe stock is limited. There remain potential suitors for the company. The most likely is Fidelity National, which has a market cap of nearly $75 billion. But if Foley sees a better bid, he will certainly take it.\n\nThe debt means PaySafe\u2019s enterprise value is fair, not low. But you can buy it here.\u201d\n\nIt now has deals with Fubo, Montana Lottery Sportsbook, and many more on the way\u2026\n6 days ago:\n\n\u201cFuboTV Inc (NYSE: FUBO) is trading higher Thursday after the company's subsidiary, Fubo Gaming, announced a partnership with Paysafe (NYSE: PSFE).\nFubo Sportsbook will plug into Paysafe for credit and debit card payments. It is expected to launch in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\n2 Days Ago:\n\n\u201cHOUSTON, October 04, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Paysafe (NYSE: PSFE), a leading specialized payments platform, today announced a new partnership with INTRALOT, a leading global gaming solutions supplier. INTRALOT\u2019s sports-betting platform has integrated with Paysafe to enable the Montana government-operated lottery to provide its online sportsbook patrons with a comprehensive suite of traditional and alternative payment methods via a single API.\u201d\n\nThe third and fourth quarter earnings are going to beat.  There are no supply chain issues with this company and gambling is through the roof.  I don\u2019t YOLO but I\u2019m considering it with this stock.  At only $7 and $5 Billion Market Cap this is one of the best deals.  \n\nMore institutional ownership then ever:\n\n\n\u201cThe number of bullish hedge fund positions improved by 9 lately. Paysafe Limited (NYSE:PSFE) was in 50 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of June. The all time high for this statistic was previously 41. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that PSFE isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q2 rankings).\u201d\n\nGet on the rocket at this price\u2026its not going to zero so very limited risk at this level.  Revenue increasing every quarter\u2026.just look at the charts.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they announce getting into BNPL as well since that is the hot industry.\n\nPositions:\n\n3000 Shares\n11/19/21 8C",

The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qn847nz0a5s71.png?width=1759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d05be8973c4bfefe00396c250fb92fe123c5f0ae\n\nThe ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.\n\n\u00b7 Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape.\n\n\u00b7 A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to.\n\n\u00b7 Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjzym5w1a5s71.png?width=1764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e77f88b654fe44aca54902b8a4f1d18bb7c519b9\n\nSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins.\n\nSay a consumer wants to rent an airbnb. They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments.\n\nPayoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer.\n\nMy view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xuonwi2a5s71.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b57e5a829bbcb5d58f51cbdc2e426ceca0ccd2a3\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It\u2019s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zi2sl613a5s71.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e959a0115d4cbb201b531f77ae5276a31026a7d1\n\nWho are their customers and where are they know? 5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1kinxk3a5s71.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74cd5a7bdb3d3934ce730e1dd9aa9204ff72b259\n\n# Payoneer vs PayPal\n\nThe growth of Payoneer\u2019s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country. \n\n2018 PayPal study suggest that India\u2019s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world\u2019s gig workforce.\n\n**In August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India.**\n\n*\u201cPayPal says to shut domestic payments business in India\u201d \\~ Reuters*\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will wind down its domestic payments business in India from April 1,2021 the company said in a statement on Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcipi9b4a5s71.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3b20d766db9f0b8302c16582755758489bc479e\n\nB2B global marketplace.

From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they\u2019re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)\n\nVolume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghmjbjt4a5s71.png?width=1721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c9dcfa310f5e6a4bc90b66fbf9fc8b018377aa7\n\nThe benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer\u2019s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company\u2019s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9x3x8b5a5s71.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caa49b84156468b94a9f50b9a23ffb208340eba3\n\nWhat do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.\n\n**Growth:**\n\nNote that Payoneer currently doesn\u2019t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for retail to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).\n\nWe just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. ($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95silwp5a5s71.png?width=1748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f10a138995c52367baa00ed4a10e9287c5da04ee\n\n**Acquisition:**  \n Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.\n\nWildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game. First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction. They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, i am not a financial advisor. I have a long position with the warrants that i purchased in February and are therefore in the red.",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone, I hope you had a nice and relaxing weekend.\n\n*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

With the major indices hovering near relevant SMA's, the next few days will be important for the market. Will we see a bounce off these support levels once again, or will we break down? Things are looking bearish to me from a TA standpoint, but we'll see how things look closer to market open. I'll also be watching the mega caps closely, as if they show weakness, the whole market could follow. Growth slowdown remains a concern, as we saw Goldman Sachs cut their U.S. GDP growth forecast for both 2021 and next year. With growth slowdown concerns and supply chain issues, we could be in for quite a ride this (and next) earnings season.\u00a0\n\nSPY is trading a bit over 436, and could test the SMA(100) at \\~434.81 as support in today's trading. SMA(9) is also relevant at 433.86. If we easily break down through those levels, we could see more red. Regardless, we should see more volatility today. If SPY sees strength, I'll be watching the resistance level around 438. DIA is trading a bit over 347 and could test the SMA(100) as resistance around that level. I'll also be watching price action around the 346 support level. QQQ\u00a0is trading a bit under 359 and looking bearish this morning. Currently gapping down below the SMA(100) and the SMA(9), it will likely test that 359 level as resistance. If it can't get back up, we could see red over the next few days. Gold and silver are each slightly down this morning, while crude oil is up over 3% and looks to continue its recent strength. Bitcoin is currently trading around 56,400, and we could see more consolidation up at this resistance level. Crypto-related stocks are up in premarket trading, trading in sympathy with Bitcoin. Airlines and cruise stocks are down a bit in premarket. It will be interesting if they hold up over support levels and maintain the new uptrend, or if we see more selling off. Meme stocks have been quiet recently, but it's always worth keeping an eye on them.\u00a0\n\nRemember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",

        "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\nSome of you may know me from my educational and due diligence posts at r/DoctorStock. We've been researching Square for the past 2 weeks, these are our compiled findings. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1sp1phm14us71.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dd82ffe277b3d03d17f5749f1920cfd1fe0e4bf\n\n**5-Year Recap**\n\n* Market Cap has increased by 710%\n* Total Revenue has increased by 620%\n* Gross Margin hs decreased by 39%\n* EPS Dilution has increased by 800%\n* P/S Ratio has increased by 30%\n* P/E Ratio N/A\n* P/B Ratio has increased by 133%\n* Total Liabilities have increased by 691%\n* Dividend Yield: 0%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Behind the Company**\n\nSquare is an e-commerce platform for small and large businesses. Square makes it easier for customers to pay for products and services. Square\u2019s biggest product currently is a card reader that enables businesses to offer credit card payments instead of solely using cash. Square owns the popular Cash App which allows users to send payments, receive payments, invest, hold, and buy/sell bitcoin.\n\n**Industry Overview**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) industry has seen some major growth this past year. There are advantages to using BNPL over credit cards. With BNPL technology, consumers don\u2019t have to worry about their credit scores. This can be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage. If you have a low credit score, you can use Square to avoid taking more hits on your credit. However, you can\u2019t build up your credit score using Square. \n\n**News Timeline**\n\nJuly 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-square-banking))\n\nAugust 1, 2021\\[Source\\](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-announces-plans-to-acquire-afterpay)\n\n* Square announces plan to acquire Afterpay\n   * Aimed towards a younger generation\n\nSeptember 20, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-launches-integrated-omnichannel-solutions-for-businesses-in-france))\n\n* Square plans to enter France market\n\nSeptemeber 28, 2021\\[Source\\]([https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14b72cf0-0153-3985-ae1e-4ccf7d198700/square-partners-with-tiktok.html))\n\n* Square partners with TikTok\n\n\\[Source\\]([https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187](https://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-bnpl-payments-affirm-square-51632845187))\n\n* Mastercard announces plan to enter BNPL market\n\n**Competitors**\n\n* PayPal\n* Fiserv\n* Global Payments\n* Affirm Holdings\n* Shopify \n* Clover\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SQ/SdTObmDK-Square-SQ-Descending-Channel/)\n\n**Bullish Case**\n\n* BNPL industry has global potential to grow \n* Small business lending is increasing\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin \n\n**Bearish Case**\n\n* Strong competition in the BNPL industry\n* Speculation of future revenue reliant on Bitcoin\n* Invested heavily in Bitcoin\n\n**Management** \n\nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey is somewhat a prodigy. Having co-founded Twitter back in 06\u2019, Jack now. Dorsey is one of the most successful self-taught coders in the world. Not many CEOs can say they\u2019ve helped build their companies' platforms and helped manage them. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI am concerned about Mastercard\u2019s announcement to enter the BNPL market. I believe that other credit cards and banks will follow suit. Up until now, banks have been slow to respond and are sustaining huge losses because of it. The BNPL market is pretty saturated as it is. The BNPL market as a whole is very expensive (coming from a small investor's POV). Square\u2019s P/B ratio is currently at 40, which indicates that the company might be overvalued. On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I am concerned with Square\u2019s ties to bitcoin. I labeled this as both a bullish and bearish case. Square invested a good chunk of money in bitcoin. That means their reliant on bitcoins performance. If bitcoin goes up, they go up. If bitcoin goes down, they do down. There is a lot of news and government intervention surrounding bitcoin which can either be positive or negative. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your own research\\*\\**",
