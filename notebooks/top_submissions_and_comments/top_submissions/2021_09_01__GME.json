        "selftext": " \n\nI've been following $IRNT since the post market jump when it went from $16 to $40 in AH. It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.\n\nThe setup is simple:\n\n1. The float is currently 1.3M shares due to SPAC redemptions &amp; lockups and will be at this number until after options expiry on Sep 17th.\n2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float\n3. Almost 200% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration. The movement we saw Friday is what we refer to as a \"pre-squeeze\" movement, there is likely far more to come.\n4. On Friday the $20 strike became ITM and instantly doubled the amount of the float that is claimed by the open interest.\n5. As of this morning ORTEX shows 4.3M shares shorted which amounts to 336% SI with a cost to borrow of 628% on average. I have doubts about the accuracy of this specific data because that would put the amount of the float claimed by institutional obligations nearing 600%, so I'll stick with saying that the last reliable data seemingly had SI at around 13% with the same elevated cost to borrow.\n\nIf $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of $ORGO &amp; $GME.\n\n$IRNT will very likely start running some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.\n\nBe warned, this play is incredible risky, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.",

        "selftext": "Gather around folks, hope y\u2019all made some gains the last time around. This DD is split into 8 parts, so feel free to jump to whichever section you\u2019re most interested in.\n\n**Part 1 \u2013 Introduction**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n**Part 3 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\n**Part 5 \u2013 Financials and Valuation**\n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\n**Part 1 \u2013 Introduction**\n\nIt was a warm Monday morning on August 23rd almost a month back, when seemingly for no reason \u2013 **GOEV shot up from ~$5.9 to ~$8, a 30% gain on the day.** The next day \u2013 GME popped, for a 30% gain as well, with AMC and BB also making up big gains, leading to the \u2018meme mania\u2019 we\u2019ve been experiencing for the last couple of weeks. \n\nWhy\u2019d this happen? Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there\u2019s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD\u2019s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for \u2018meme stocks\u2019 which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don\u2019t know, haven\u2019t investigated that particular theory but there\u2019s plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you\u2019re so inclined. \n\nThe quick point I\u2019m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question \u2013 and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule \u2013 seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems \u2013 for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n* From an investment into equities point of view \u2013 S&amp;P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month \u2014 other than a slight dip in February \u2014 over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) \n\n* Let\u2019s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it\u2019s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   \n\n* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) \n\n* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). \n\n* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. [link]( https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\n* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. \n\n* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) \n\n* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) \n\n* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  \n\n* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois\u2019 clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). \n\n* By 2030, there\u2019s expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market. [link](https://gyazo.com/66173e4431b4c6b30ac7ed0662f13f1c) \n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Before we look into what\u2019s happened since my last post, let\u2019s go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. \n\nIt is this modular platform that led to Apple\u2019s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car\u2019s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).\n\nApple wasn\u2019t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia\u2019s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as \u2018pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal\u2026 Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company\u2019 [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). \n\nUltimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo\u2019s chairman didn\u2019t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn\u2019t factor in the value of Canoo\u2019s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo\u2019s own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) \n\nRegarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo\u2019s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo\u2019s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). \n\nThe use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants\n\n* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nThese enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo\u2019s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 \u2013 layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) \n\nThe three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:\n\nLifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It\u2019s pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I\u2019d recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself.

The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):\n\n* Launching as early as 2023.\n\n* Price \u2013 Not currently listed, but during the Q&amp;A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category \u2013 you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  \n\n* Targeted HP \u2013 500+\n\n* Payload Capacity \u2013 1800 lbs\n\n* Range \u2013 200+ mi\n\n* Powertrain \u2013 AWD or RWD\n\nThere\u2019s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn\u2019t been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). \n\nWe can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It\u2019s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well.

The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).\n\nPartnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US &amp; EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar \u2018is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone.\u201d The Nedcar facility is slated to build up to 1000 units for both the US and European markets in 2022 with a target of 15,000 units in 2023 [link]( https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)\n\nDe-risking the path to market, Canoo designed, built and tested beta for its lifestyle vehicle [link](https://gyazo.com/e9e9bee044f83da1536c1ab57809dece), with highlights including:\n\n* &gt;$250M invested in Beta\n\n* ~1.5M hours of engineering\n\n* ~500k miles of testing\n\n* 13 beta runners / 32 beta properties tested\n\n* US NCAP 5-star overall rating targeted, with simulated, sled and vehicle level crash testing.\n\nUndertaking the Gamma Phase with SOP on track for Q4 2022 [link]( https://gyazo.com/772813dd1ab4b30255dfdfa9674006ce), with key highlights including:\n\n* &gt;12 months of testing\n\n* ~120-150 vehicles will be built and validated\n\n* ~70 crash tests\n\n* 30 sled tests\n\n* Full slate of vehicle tests; no shortcuts\n\n* 80% of all components are sourced\n\n* 63% of all engineering is released\n\n* 54% of tooling is committed\n\nPartnering with the frontdoor collective for 10,000 MPDVs, the frontdoor collective are a network of delivery service partners that provide dependable last-mile delivery experience, with founders and executives with experience from FedEx, Walmart, XPO, Amazon, Instacart and the U.S. military.

Lafferty - $19 [link](https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124) \n\n* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/) \n\n* Bank of America - $5 (can\u2019t find the article at the moment but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen it somewhere)\n\nAverage = $13, current SP = $6.7\n\nAs of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). \n\nThe company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.\n\nAt a pre-revenue stage there\u2019s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:\n\n* Over 9,500 non-binding preorders \u2013 which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).\n\n* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).\n\nAs far as valuations go, let\u2019s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look \u2013 based on their market cap. I\u2019m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I\u2019ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.\n\n* Lucid Motors \u2013 $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021\n\n* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 \n\n* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, &gt;17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 \n\n* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 \n\n* Canoo \u2013 $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV \n\n* Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B\n\nJust looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven\u2019t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there\u2019s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo\u2019s cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).  \n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\nWith anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that\u2019s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I\u2019m on the bullish side for the company, I\u2019ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won\u2019t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market \u2013 these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I\u2019ll summarize them below:\n\n* As of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. \n\n* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.\n\n* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.\n\n* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production \u2013 H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to go the additional equity route.\n\n* In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) \u2013 nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\nI know y\u2019all have just been waiting for this so I\u2019ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that\u2019ll help understand GOEV\u2019s squeezability.\n\n* Short Interest \u2013 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float \n\n* Market Cap \u2013 $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it\u2019s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital\n\n* Extremely Memeable \u2013 I mean\u2026 GOEV, like Go\u2026 EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria\n\n* Low Liquidity \u2013 Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)\n\n* Low Risk (IV) \u2013 Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you\u2019re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by /u/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it\u2019s not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There\u2019s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn\u2019t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I\u2019d agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\nThe global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. \n\nPresident Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at &lt;$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. \n\nCanoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.\n\nTo facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)\n\n* &gt;70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nIf we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it\u2019s $4,000 rebate \u2013 that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you\u2019re getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.\n\nIf you made it this far, I\u2019d like to thank you for reading this \u2013 I\u2019d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won\u2019t). They\u2019re extremely dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company \u2013 from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups. Y\u2019all the real MVPs. Position \u2013 1k shares @ 11.69.",

This was expected (for a change, lol) and the shares are subject to lockup.*\n\nSince my last post, the percentage of float claimed by institutional obligations has risen from 273% to **479%** of float.\n\nToday we saw movement confirming an active gamma squeeze. Tomorrow, after a gap up, should be the first day of ***full squeeze*** movement to be compared with AMC on 06/02 and GME on 01/26 with a peak occurring on Friday. My PTs stay the same, the ones we haven't hit are now just more likely.\n\n~~Most Likely:~~ **~~$29~~** **Broken in intraday today 09/15**  \n~~Likely:~~ **~~$40~~** **Broken in post market 09/15**  \nIf everything goes right: **$135**  \nIf it matches other squeezes: **$210**  \nIf it goes to the moon: **$530**\n\nAs I said in the other posts, this situation is highly unusual and the low float on this stock enables it to run really fast and really hard when buy volume comes in. This also makes this play very risky so only partake with money that you can afford to lose.\n\n**Good luck and godspeed gentlemen.**\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.",

        "selftext": " **TL;DR - stock with gamma squeeze potential and 157% short interest of float gets my dick hard. If OPAD reaches $16 market makers will need to hedge nearly 100% of float--and stock already reached $16 last Thursday. Market makers &amp; short sellers fucked.**\n\nNo doubt you've seen the IRNT posts about the unique situation arising from a low float and high call options. Well I've got news for you: I've been watching $OPAD like a hawk and it looks to be ramping up into the exact same situation as IRNT, and yet somehow you apes haven't realized this yet. If you're sad you missed out on IRNT and you think underwater mining is bullshit, then have I got the play for you. And you can actually seemingly get in early on this one too. I've been accumulating my position in OPAD since last Tuesday while watching the gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential increase every day. Read on for what I know, and buckle up cause this is a big one\u2026\n\n[OPAD is where IRNT was two weeks ago](https://preview.redd.it/0z9j53b2bon71.png?width=1659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f0f1c45bdd00818c3f61abc3640cd686efde050)\n\n*This is not financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Please keep in mind this is a high risk play and I am a random stranger on the internet - so make sure you do your own research! Don't blame me if you're a dumbass who YOLOs their whole account into 150% OTM 3 DTE calls and this doesn't materialize.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Background\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, some background on the company. Offerpad ($OPAD) is an iBuyer company with a current market cap of 2.636B.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wxq4xw4bon71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3beaf0d4855963388afc86057c8f74523ca2c797\n\nAn iBuyer is basically a company that uses their technology to make quick offers to home sellers, then re-sell those homes themselves for profit. Think Redfin, Zillow, Opendoor - those are OPAD's competitors.\n\nOfferpad de-SPACed just a few weeks ago and started trading as OPAD on September 2. For some reason investors fucking hated this thing, so prior to the ticker change the SPAC had a huge percent of redemptions just like IRNT - a whopping 92% redemption rate. As a result, there are now only 3,387,913 shares in the free float until PIPE unlocks (TBD at this point). And, just like IRNT, OPAD has fallen into this retarded loophole created by the genius SEC where it somehow has options even though the current float is technically too small for listing options.\n\n[Redemption info from OPAD's super 8K filing - a legal filing our SEC overlords make each SPAC file when it completes its merger and de-SPACs](https://preview.redd.it/1vjw8d48bon71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75752ce6d62b95ac0731442ef2fdb5da9c49580b)\n\nAs a result of the low float the stock has been extremely volatile since it began trading as OPAD on 9/2. It's seen 10-20% intraday swings pretty much every day since the ticker change. If you had just been trading those dips you'd actually probably be pretty fucking rich by now. OPAD even reached a high of $16 last Thursday. Just as it was starting to gamma squeeze into orbit, though, it was shorted to shit Thursday into Friday and eventually closed Friday down almost 40% from that $16 high. More on that shorting below - point is, this is super volatile and therefore also a high risk play. If that's too scary for you, though, then why the fuck are you on [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) in the first place? Go back to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and your 3 fund portfolio.\n\nAlso, if you're a smooth brain who obsesses over technical analysis - OPAD looks to have had a nearly perfect gap fill yesterday and has since started to take off into orbit (up 29% from that low end of day Tuesday).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qheyfjjdbon71.png?width=1669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b58b811614984f2013a2cdfb05a2259e7195d04\n\nClosed 9/3 at $8.63 and gapped up to open 9/7 at $10.09. On 9/3 retraced back down to $8.60 for all of one minute before bouncing back up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Fucked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, now to the really good stuff. I know as soon as you read \"gamma squeeze\" in the title your itty bitty micropeen got hard as a thumbtack, so let me give you some porn to jack off to.\n\nJust like IRNT, OPAD's options can put market makers in the position where they would need to buy over 100% of OPAD's current float in order to hedge their risk from writing options to retards like you all on WSB - and frankly, it's not that hard for OPAD to reach the point where this would happen. As further OTM call options become in the money, market makers will have to buy more and more of these shares to sell to you if you decide to exercise the contract. This is because of the options Greeks Delta and Gamma. Now normally I know that for you retards \"options Greeks\" usually means the options your wife's Greek boyfriend tells you to buy, but for this play Delta and Gamma are super important.\n\nSince I know you dgaf about options Greeks, let me try to dumb it down for you apes with a picture:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2pluvjwjbon71.png?width=1747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892bf16fa9e8a9325c69b8808fbad066e460a6bb\n\nBased on the options open interest as of yesterday, if OPAD reached $16 then market makers would need to hedge 98.21% of the current float. At Wednesday's close price, only 29.72% of the float would need to be hedged - still a huge amount, but clearly this thing has room to run. And on top of that, OPAD already managed to reach $16 last Thursday before it was swatted down by short sellers.\n\nRight now, as the price increases past $16 market makers would need to buy less and less additional stock to hedge since the stock price becomes further and further from the open options interest. If more people buy more OTM options, though, then the price could run even higher because market makers would need to buy even more stock even after the price runs (aka the situation IRNT is in right now). This is delta and gamma at play, and what can create a gamma squeeze. This covering would be incredibly difficult for market makers to do because of the low number of stock available in the float. OPAD already briefly reached $16 last Thursday and OPAD's options volume and open interest has been steadily increasing, so who knows what the fuck could happen over the next few days as we head into September options expiration.\n\nAlso, since you're a degenerate and have likely already started to buy options on this shit before even finishing my DD you may have noticed that OPAD's options open interest and volume is much lower than IRNT's. For one, this is probably because you apes haven't caught wind of OPAD until right now and haven't yet started buying large amounts of retardedly OTM calls. However, even with the lower overall open interest there is still a ton of potential.\n\nHere is OPAD's total open interest and volume since I started tracking it last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ahxfhvmbon71.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592b7835a2304db6ab812fdccfd9fb680b477ab8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puvnpdmobon71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e5d576a1ba05856cbe93449daa6b8c72cae3791\n\nHere's OPAD's OI and most recent volume for September expiration compared to IRNT, as of the end of the day Wednesday:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||OPAD|IRNT|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Puts - OI|3,326|25,276|\n|Calls - OI|19,369|58,031|\n|Put-Call Ratio - OI|0.17|0.44|\n|Puts - Volume|1,605|9,719|\n|Calls - Volume|16,205|41,787|\n|Put-Call Ratio - Volume|0.10|0.23|\n\nWhile the total number of calls (for all strikes and for September) is lower than IRNT, there are pretty much no puts open for OPAD whereas IRNT has almost half as many open puts as calls. Puts that market makers sell counteract the hedging that market makers need to do when price increases in order to cover the calls they sell, so for OPAD a much lower relative number of puts means that the open calls could still require market makers to hedge a large volume of shares even if there are less total calls than IRNT. To dumb it down for you apes - less put mean slightly less call still go big boom.\n\nAnd all of this isn't even accounting for you dumbass apes who love short-dated OTM options. Just like GME, stock buying is what can really get this going. But, more options open interest means that the gamma squeeze potential will only increase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Short Interest - Short Sellers Fucked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y56rygbybon71.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb999d9ecbf55fe076aae8dbf20f5f8cc49a7977\n\n[I know short squeezes are like crack to you people, and I'm here to feed your addiction.](https://preview.redd.it/jck8gau0con71.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc05bf4a5ebb91d0c4ceba8067c56f69ad856da5)\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, ever since OPAD started to run last week it's been getting hammered by short sellers. To begin with, even taking out the gamma squeeze considerations with OPAD it's a retarded idea to short this stock right now. OPAD is a legitimate growth stock with many signs that it's significantly undervalued right now and could likely be a nice return even if you were to just buy and hold. For example, OPAD's 2021 projected revenue is $1.7-$1.85 billion. With their current market cap, they would only be trading at a 1.55 multiple; OPAD's peers are trading at multiple times higher than that. Even if all outstanding warrants are executed and after PIPE unlock, this stock will still be undervalued relative to its peers.\n\nThe crazy thing about the shorting is that according to Ortex, short sellers have now managed to accumulate a total short interest of 5.33 million - which is **157% of the current float**. Short interest **increased 36% yesterday**, cost to borrow reached as high as **220.08%**, and **utilization is at 99.98%** (aka there are pretty much no shares left to short).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/btsivxm2con71.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684fd041c0a8b15af0761fed6ed835d88b9a1634\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fvtcdr3con71.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1948a30365647cadf2459096e789bbe99c1c211\n\nShort sellers would already need to purchase 1.5x the current float to fully cover their positions. However - remember what I said earlier about the market makers needing to buy stocks to cover the calls they're writing to you retards? Because the market makers are doing that, there would be even less shares for short sellers to cover with. This is how you get to infinity squeeze potential - there just wouldn't be nearly enough shares available for everyone to buy what they need to cover. This gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential is also exactly what happened with GME back in January. It's almost like these dumbass short sellers haven't learned a damn thing.\n\nIt also seems that these short sellers caught on to this risk and really don't want this thing to blast off. And I take offense to that - I want my tendies. These huge drops in price were rally killers. If you check the open interest from Ortex above you'll see the huge increase in short interest after last Thursday.\n\n[Shorts fucking with OPAD when it started to take off last Thursday](https://preview.redd.it/mr2cfuu4con71.png?width=1666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=359769d5f4676a797ecff357c00ad0f47fe90927)\n\n[Shorts fucking with OPAD again when it started to take off Wednesday](https://preview.redd.it/dpsq83p5con71.png?width=1670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f80e9a93511d65bb9c10f457249823e70a8b07)\n\nWhat's great is that even though this has been significantly beaten down by short sellers, OPAD has come right back after each dip you see above. This thing just cannot be beaten.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eht6wkq7con71.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=570e9c1bd82e51863c34106b5666d0e8fa91e483\n\nMore importantly, though, is that since these short sellers seem to just keep doubling down each time this thing starts to blast off they will be extra mega-fucked once it actually does achieve liftoff. Each time they double down on their shorting they are just adding more fuel to the fire. More than that, if the folks shorting OPAD are the same ones shorting other low float stocks like IRNT, and OPAD pops alongside those other stocks - we very well could see short sellers getting margin called from multiple positions turning extremely against them all at once just like we saw back in January/February with GME, AMC, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4s8y6k8con71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=572dfc1c1e7a6baf03e1fe610864b755ce7b8547\n\nSo, there you have it--yet another gamma squeeze/short squeeze stock for you to go apeshit over. Good luck, this one should be lit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/up8fm599con71.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92991b84268635c27e5f743f9584bb74c1c6d7d7\n\nOh, also - positions below. I didn't sell last Thursday during the run, instead I've been steadily buying more. This baby still has lots of room to run and has yet to truly pop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpjcqs3acon71.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8f2449319bc5ee538da2015162549ea25434b2c",

        "selftext": "Alright reta...oh fuck, it's been a few months.., I mean apes. I'm back with a play you all can relate to...but first, here's the summary and re-introduction.\n\n**TL;DR:** Dole just went public, trades cheaply vs. peers, and sells bananas, other fruits, and veggies. Apes eat all of the above. Options just opened up two weeks ago and will accelerate the multiple re-rating as institutions and apes buy DOLE and the multiple normalizes, share price rises, and we all enjoy tendie flavored bananas over the coming months/years.\n\n**About me:** Some OGs (as in, pre-January mania) may remember me as the **GMEdd** dot com **$169.42 PT** guy that was invested in GME for longer than our friend u/DeepFuckingValue and made several podcasts + appearances on Bloomberg, Benzinga, etc. I shared some DD with WSB [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k34e7x/gme_yolo_roth_ira/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kknuk6/gme_icr_conference_words_matter/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/krdqp5/gme_4q20_financial_model_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) etc...you get the fucking point. We all know how that story played out in January, many early entrants were rewarded with [life-changing tendies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l93d18/gme_og_team_uberkikz11_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)..., alas many late entrants were also fukt by Vlad et al, such is life. \n\nBack to the play that really ripened my banana. We're talking about a literal ape play: the world's largest producer of fresh produce, newly IPOed Dole Plc. (DOLE):\n\n[North American &amp; European exposure to Bananas &amp; Various Fruits &amp; Vegetables](https://preview.redd.it/gwqt341udcq71.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e8bfd8b5037afe214b1f627290b6fbe59c20bf7)\n\n[Share Leader in Key Categories; Growth Opportunity in Higher Margin Value-Added Produce](https://preview.redd.it/5abh528ydcq71.png?width=626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00eb4fbc38da6b89aebb19d472d7dd8adf18e9ac)\n\nFor those of you care about the details, dig into this [excellent analysis by ValueSits](https://valuesits.substack.com/p/total-produce-plc-dole-food-company) laying out the entire landscape. I'll translate a few key points into ret...ape:\n\n* Dole Plc, global #1 player in fresh produce by a wide margin, is the product of a merger between Total Produce Plc and Dole Food Company that then went public to refinance &amp; de-lever combined entity's debt\n* Upside opportunity ranges from 2x-3x current levels in 12-24 months, while downside risk appears limited, around the \\~$14/share level  \n* Synergies expected to improve combined Dole Plc's EBITDA by \\~10%, with mid single digit growth going forward. **At its core this is a mispriced security, not a growth play.**\n\nSo there we have it; Dole returned to public markets two months ago on the back of a merger with UK based Total Produce that has yielded an absolute King Kong-sized player, currently priced like Diddy. The IPO went poorly, trading down \\~9%, and the price closed yesterday at $15.02. Why might the IPO have gone poorly?\n\n* IPO fatigue (IPO volumes this year on track to surpass the dotcom peak of $97B, per Renaissance Capital, in particular volumes were elevated around Dole's IPO (\\~$10B that week alone)\n* Weak investor roadshow and IPO occurred during a quiet Summer period\n* Apes were not given a lifetime supply of bananas for being part of the IPO (okay, not really)\n\nNow Uberkikz11, you may ask, why will the price go higher? Institutional ownership is low and will rise over time as Dole will be eligible for inclusion in the Russell 2000 and S&amp;P Small Cap 600 indices with its current \\~$1.4B market cap. This plays out over the next year. Also, options trading opened less than two weeks ago, and has extremely low open interest and implied volatility... if apes go bananas, well, the re-rating will go ever faster. Notably, I pointed this out to some GME OGs yesterday and it appears that option volume has already begun to rise, with more calls traded yesterday than since options trading began. I'm sure it's nothing.\n\n[S&amp;P Capital IQ shows \\~13&amp;#37; Institutional Ownership, to Rise Upon Index Inclusion](https://preview.redd.it/jtfl4mxbgcq71.png?width=2830&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6e4db79e03675ce05d05d14ea106361a683c1af)\n\n[Options trading has just opened up, with a cheap IV by WSB standards](https://preview.redd.it/lcs3zj8zccq71.png?width=2680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed08d2acb9f6bcb2e1b7cd1e449288dbf6195b0b)\n\n[Significant Discount to Peer Group Expected to Close Over Time](https://preview.redd.it/1utxczmdjcq71.png?width=861&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e6ee02967d441a46b05f97583f2e374896ee7cb)\n\nA few other points:\n\n* Analyst coverage is just getting underway, and so far 12mo price targets range from $15-$26/share\n* Inflation risk is minimal as the vertically integrated DOLE will pass through costs to end buyers (retailers, wholesalers)... indeed, with its scale advantage I expect DOLE to outperform smaller peers in this regard\n* Prior IPOs of US listed produce businesses saw material re-ratings within the first 12 months: Mission Produce rose from 11.1x to \\~15x in 4 months from Oct20 to Feb21 and Lamb Weston listed at 7.5x rising to \\~15x in five months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that said, I took a large initial position yesterday: **5000 shares and 50 May22 $15C**.

        "selftext": "Greetings to the most intelligent people on the planet!\n\nI've been playing with GME and the other charts recently, and it all accumulated into a massive piece of delicious TA,  which I didn't really plan to post to WSB originally - because I felt like some of the honorable WSB residents might be a little tired from that particular stonk. However, after seening [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pppfro/tmc_spotted_the_cock_and_balls_upside_down_head/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pph9f0/as_you_can_see_tmc_is_forming_a_classic_nut_sack/) beautiful examples of intellectual superiority, I just couldn't resist sharing my hard work with you, dear WSB!(If you, dear reader, are the one who is fed up with GME, then I would recommend you stop reading now and follow the two links above to appreciate HQ TA on other stonks).\n\nFor those, who stayed - enjoy the read!\n\nIt all started from my \u201cL'Oreal shampoo commercial\u201d-like hair bet post, where, in its third chapter, I was theorizing about GME's negative beta (particularly in light of the late January events, when the buy button was disabled) and the current general market setup - how it might influence subsequent GME moves. So, I decided to dive deeper into those correlations and deviations between the price movements of GME and other major assets, using January sneeze as the starting point. This led me to a fascinating, tits-jacking discovery that points at the upcoming inevitable volatile price action!\n\nBuckle up for the TA journey of your life, let\u2019s ~~dive~~ fly in!\n\nOh, almost forgot to quote Jack Black:\n\n&gt;\u201cThis is not the financial advice, no.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is just a tribute.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Couldn't remember becoming a financial advisor, no.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is a tribute, oh, to the greatest stonk in the world, alright!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst things first, it\u2019s a good idea therefore to revisit **late Jan events**, which in my opinion was the moment of revelation and a preview of inevitable storm, when:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I. The North Remembers:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME v VIX v SP, 30 min chart](https://preview.redd.it/yu1zzckpa2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e10bd82e172e82ea16a68da5c9c4a9c3e07f70ff)\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a single day,\n* and injuring SP badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, the thesis should sound something like GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99=SP\ud83c\udd98, and vice versa. It will be developed further in the next chapters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, quoting my bet post here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, I should recommend  you reading u/peruvian_bull Endgame series, and/or u/Criand the Bigger Short in order to develop the understanding of the fundamental processes taking place under the hood of the financial markets. To sum up the core idea: the financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standards, it is heading to the next, coming soon, financial crisis. And, in my opinion, what you can see on the charts above, was a sneak peak of the house of cards collapsing. Disabling the buy button was the only option for the big moni guys to stop (or rather to postpone) the system failing miserably. By bringing this dirty trick into play they were able to ~~buy~~ steal some time, which was necessary for deploying emergency measures and urgent market mechanisms (such as new DTCC/NSCC rules) - which, in turn, are aimed at mitigating the inevitable financial hail**shit**storm, ready to hit the fans.\n\nThere is a plenty of outstanding fundamentals DD on that topic (start from clicking profiles in the paragraph above). As for me, I am the TA type of a wrincle-brained ape, so...\n\nLet me speak from my ~~heart~~ charts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# II. Negative beta more beautiful than Catherine Zeta\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start from something that you must have heard about many times, but did you really dive into GME exceptional beta? So, what's that thing and why is it so negative? For the sake of saving my and your time, let me quote the almighty Inve**stop**edia:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In investing, beta does not refer to fraternities, product testing, or old videocassettes. Beta is a measurement of market risk or volatility. That is, it indicates how much the price of a stock tends to fluctuate up and down compared to other stocks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The value of any stock index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, moves up and down constantly. At the end of the trading day, we conclude that \"the markets\" were up or down. An investor considering buying a particular stock may want to know whether that stock moves up and down just as sharply as stocks in general. It may be inclined to hold its value on a bad day or get stuck in a rut when most stocks are rising; whereas the beta is the number that measures a stock's volatility, the degree to which its price fluctuates in relation to the overall stock market. In other words, it gives a sense of the stock's risk compared to that of the greater market's.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Beta is used also to compare a stock's market risk to that of other stocks. Analysts use the Greek letter '\u00df' to represent beta.Beta is calculated using regression analysis. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's price tends to be more volatile than the market. A beta of less than 1 means it tends to be less volatile than the market.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Negative beta**: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely.\n\nEssentially, negative beta asset is an asset that tends to move in the opposite direction from the general market. Famous precious metal is one of the good examples: gold and gold stocks have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines. That is exactly the reason why investors cherish this asset in the turbulent time of recessions, market crashes and corrections, or general uncertainty and volatility - historically gold tends to perform well during such periods, providing the 'safe heaven' to market participants and acting as a hedge. Noice, but this turbulent time we have something special on the horizon.\n\n\\*\\*Le wild negative beta unicorn appears\\*\\*\n\n[Captain GME to gold](https://preview.redd.it/rpv734w9c2o71.png?width=471&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56080fa590e5ecb6f65ad1a72329cd4d12569014)\n\nMany of you must have seen -\u00df posts, but math and numbers are for geniuses, retards only understand crayons and visuals, so...\n\nLadies and gentleapes, with the great pleasure I present you the new negative beta king:\n\n[GME v SP, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/iwtaoohhc2o71.jpg?width=2039&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67b2824b31bf155c6f7d5f992c5141f67a82cdfb)\n\nWhat you see on the chart above is a vivid illustration of GME's negative beta behavior, which commenced during/after the January sneeze. As for SP, the stable uptrend with the minor corrections is evident, while the asset is achieving ATHs on a regular basis. Looking at the GME now and connecting its highs with the median line, we may observe the opposite trend, as the line is descending. All in all, there is a big-ass convergence manifesting between the two assets, which most probably will result in the increased volatility and the explosive GME breakout / trend reversal for SP. Who will blink first?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME v SP daily chart + Tower of Pisa](https://preview.redd.it/3fiwmwwqc2o71.jpg?width=2033&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63ecddcaa4651b946a4df8541409c8d8e547d435)\n\nNext, take a look at this chart. Don't worry about GME's Pisa offset here, as it is insignificant for the point I'm making (and I had some struggles overlaying the charts in this case). If the previous chart indicates a longer term negative correlation, the one above is like a zoom in: there is an obvious series of divergences and convergences highlighted yellow and blue respectively, which illustrate negative beta again, but on a smaller scale and with local trends. As you can see, as soon a GME bullrun commences and accelerates, SP dips, and vice versa. I hope, that the examples provided are persuasive, and that they helped you to reach the same conclusion as I did, namely: sstonk goes up when stonks go down, while when stonks go up, GME is suppressed = GME\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98. Should that correlation continue manifesting itself (which I'm pretty damn confident it will), the exciting times are on the way.\n\nOk, so \ud83c\udd99\ud83c\udd98 is a simple concept, but why is it important, you may ask.\n\nWell, that's why:\n\n[SP, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/6b41eaewc2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9ae4bdc7758ecdbc84425e6ea567e1d4243f9e1)\n\nSP has been forming a powerful bearish technical formation called the rising wedge, through the past year and a half. Currently it is narrowing down, and the point of breakout is not far away - typically it is to the downside for such a technical setup. Add GME with its negative beta to this equation - if you know, you know.\n\n[SP 4H chart, I called it \u2018Head of Penis\u2019 formation ](https://preview.redd.it/sbs9va8od2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce9b57e1a6fa2020ac1c91218ad5d462ceda5d07)\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more!\n\n[SP, monthly chart ](https://preview.redd.it/1goqfoa2e2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3eefcd4720f38907877a2791ea642c3955122b5)\n\nIn one of my TA longwrites, the Big Short 2.0, I identified a beautiful, long term, juicy Elliott 1-2-3-4-5 impulse wave structure on SP, take a look! The investors are currently riding the top of the fifth wave, which is usually the most fun, euphoric and crazily risky. Everything in the nature works in cycles, and all the things that go up, must go down eventually! Considering the current bullrun being one of the (if not THE) most powerful and longest bullruns in history, you can imagine how nasty the retrace may look this time. Especially, when you take into account the fact that current financial markets are filled with shitty synthetic derivatives, excessive leverage of a bad quality, unthinkable level of risk, and... plain fucking crime. The financial world is craving for the correction (like Sahara for rainfall) and a proper bear market, as the deleveraging will make it healthier, and maybe, just maybe, it will bring price discovery back to life from the grave where it has been rolling for I don\u2019t know how long.\n\nMan, I wish there was a safe heaven asset that would protect me from the upcoming financial typhoon, the price of which would move the opposite way from the overdue nasty correction on all financial markets, which have been enjoying the most powerful bullrun in history for more than ten fucking years... Oh, wait!\n\n[Vasco da Gama can\u2019t be wrong ](https://preview.redd.it/gt1rnbz7e2o71.png?width=571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f6db503236cce3d87f8c4511221e8b5e30f91bb)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# III. Chew it Over with VIX\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about Volatility Index - what I noticed recently, is that VIX is often being neglected in the TA discussions, and in general also, so it\u2019s a good idea to show it some love. Especially since GME and VIX correlate to a considerable fucking extent, but later on that.\n\nTo begin with,\n\n[VIX, monthly chart ](https://preview.redd.it/1fcd3vlge2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c23f899b3d623552b4b402c0abe74266108223)\n\nThe chart above is provided for the visual explanation of how this instrument behaves. In short, markeds kaboom TWIX wroom wroom. In essence, the Cboe Volatility Index is a market sentiment tracking index that represents the market participants expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Volatility, or the severity of price fluctuations, is usually helpful to gauge market sentiment, particularly the degree of fear and uncertainty spreading on the financial markets. Investors use VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. It is an important index in the world of finance because it provides a quantifiable measure of market risk and investors' sentiments.\n\nAnd who would have guessed, throughout the year VIX spikes have been accompanying almost every single GME major run, but for one:\n\n[GME v VIX, daily log chart](https://preview.redd.it/ksd03p5pe2o71.jpg?width=1969&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=835dee5dd6c8b5367088857995e01a720f41f13a)\n\nJust one major outlier to that tandem is late November 2020 run. Speaking of outliers, also VIX middle of June 2021 spike seems to stand out from the crowd, as there is no relevant proportionate positive price action on the GME side. Outside of those two occasions, the correlational behaviour of these two instruments is evident. Moreover, VIX and GME runs correlate to the extent that their peaks match time-wise in several run ups. Furthermore, take a look at how starting 2021 four out of five major VIX spikes correspond with the occasions when GME\u2019s price action was trialling $230-ish level (margin call level, it seems) - the price territory, around which my concept of the \u2018Purple Haze\u2019 resistance (\u201cbreak to initiate the squeeze\u201d) is established, refer to the short squeezes comparisons post to explore the concept. The correlational behaviour described above, to my understanding, points at two big conclusions: the first and the most obvious one, is GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99; secondly, it seems that GME is currently the biggest risk for the market! - too much synchronicity is present between the two, for this to be a mere coincidence. Remember, VIX represents volatility, fear and stress - wut feelin Kenny?\n\nOh, and did I mention?\n\n[VIX, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/q0hb68xue2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcfaadcd5304e1c57307f4b954759dd402f33f8)\n\nDuring the year and a half, the instrument\u2019s price action has been consolidating into a beautiful bullish formation, called the descending wedge - which is exactly the opposite of what SP is consolidating into. VIX descending wedge + SP rising wedge + GME\ud83c\udd99VIX\ud83c\udd99SP\ud83c\udd98, quick math, and\n\n[We get an ape\u2019s best friend, Gator the Bubbles Deflator \\(the Greater\\).](https://preview.redd.it/2fzj2pdye2o71.jpg?width=2032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecbdb4676a65c16dee75b9d3613fde91cecf7335)\n\nIf you know, you know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# IV. This is the tits-jacking part. Achtung! You have been warned!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, that was quiet a TA journey. I hope that the discussion above helped you to build the solid understanding of what's happening on broader financial markets and how those correlations and tendencies are affecting GME price action, and will probably add the fuel to the rocket in the upcoming major GME moves. Now, the focus of the discussion is back on the GME current TA status quo! (yeah, finally!) And, what can I say, it is so fucking juicy!\n\nFirstly, let me remind you about this TA of mine, which aged like a fine wine:\n\n[GME, daily log chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ibiauo96f2o71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4645e967977f6c91ad71f07546993dc6140fda1)\n\nThe log chart support above proved itself to be an ape's ultimate best friend! As you can see, during the year, each time the price action approached the lower support, a sharp re-bounce followed - August and September confirmed the price line as THE most important support, manifesting the steadfast buying pressure. That pressure is currently confronting the most important resistance for GME in 2021 (magenta line). The battle will be legendary! (Hint: remember the current market setups discussed in II, and III, and the correlations? Based solely on that, what do you think the GME breakout will look like?)\n\nBut wait, there's more!

Retardos love triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarnate the flattening of the price accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is theatre stonk\u2019s price action after the breakout. \\*\\* GME: \"Hold my beer\" \\*\\* I'm pretty much convinced, that the triangle on GME chart above is how the Mother Of All Triangles must look like.\n\nButth waaitt, therrz moooore!

If you've managed to beat the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you're an investing god. That ego can make you broke, and now is the time for a humility check. \n\nYou're in this subreddit. If you're reading this, do you think you're better than the top investors out there- Burry, Dalio, Wood, Buffet? Well, maybe you are, but statistically, you're probably not. \n\nSo, what do the top investors say lately? Here's my interpretation:\n\nBurry: We're in the biggest speculative bubble of all time in all things.   \nAssets under management (AUM): $635 million\n\nDalio: US Bonds are crap, US equities are frothy, tech is bubble-ish. Get into emerging markets. China isn't so bad.   \nAUM: $140 billion\n\nBuffet: I'll reduce my positions and wait for a better entry.  \nAUM: $632 billion\n\nWood: Innovation will lead to enormous GDP and productivity growth over the next 5-10 years.   \nAUM: $53 billion\n\n=============================================\n\nIf you've been following financial news this year you probably know that Burry started shorting TSLA back in Dec 2020 and has been crying wolf that we're in a bubble since this spring. Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. \n\n Speculation is at an all-time high. Look at this chart of subscriber count for WSB:\n\n[I'm guessing most of these new subscribers aren't YOLOing on OTM SPY puts every week.](https://preview.redd.it/50kiiie6zbn71.png?width=3010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c4c7817c548515eae1823cc2f0e986565522ea9)\n\nTake a look at this chart of TSLA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhh5i2tfzbn71.png?width=2492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c354ae8100a048cf81176d619ddaaa5f51b4dda\n\nAnd compare it to the standard asset bubble chart here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hngourvbycn71.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9175668887dbb1f5639fd54ce395c38865b0a879\n\nNow with fundamentals way off, TA lining up, and lots of possible macroeconomic issues in the near future, this looks to me like a great setup for a short. Now of course, nothing is certain in the markets. BUT, if the bubble is about to pop, this could be the trading opportunity of a lifetime.

That is, even if they knew they positions were overvalued, they aren't always able to get out of before causing panic in the underlying. For this reason, you always have to take what they say with a grain of salt. Wood, who is a brilliant investor, would obviously not say that TSLA is overvalued, same that Dalio will not say that BABA is a risky stock to hold. It's a perfect case of \"do as I say, not as I do.\" So instead of listening to what they say, which is always going to be biased, try looking at what they do. \n\nAnd lately, Wood has been selling TSLA. When the **bulls start selling**, it might be a good time to get out. \n\nTSLA JAN 2022 670 PUT\n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own DD.",

        "selftext": "I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t seen any explanations on WSB (at least in recent months) about how the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust works, and how it helps to fuel the epic short squeeze going on in Uranium right now.\n\nThe physical trusts offered by Sprott are closed-end funds, meaning that when investors sell the fund, Sprott does not have to go out and also sell Uranium to fund outflows.\n\nIn other words, once uranium hits the Sprott vaults, it might as well be declared retired forever. \n\nThey are structurally diamond handed, which is important for a short squeeze to continue.\n\nSo how does more metal enter the fund?\n\nSprott has filed an \u2018at the money\u2019 share offering where they can issue new shares of the fund any time it trades at a premium to the fund\u2019s net asset value.\n\nEssentially whenever investors get excited and bid up the price of the ETF such that that shares are being bought for more than their underlying value, Sprott will issue new shares, sell them into the market (which helps bring down the premium), and then use this cash to buy more uranium for the fund.\n\nIn the span of a month investors already added enough uranium to the fund to exhaust Sprott\u2019s $300 million offering.\n\nLast week they filed a new offering to increase it from a $300 million program, to a $1,300 million ($1.3 billion) program.\n\nWhile this filing process has been ongoing the past few days, Sprott has not been issuing new shares. So inflows into the fund are driving up the premium to NAV.\n\nThe premium now sits at a record high 28.5%.\n\nFor perspective, during the Uranium surge that took price from the $20s to the $40s over the past month, the typical premium for the fund was in the mid single digit %s.\n\nSo 28.5% is absolutely remarkable. This is a dam about to break and drown everyone who lives on the other side. Once Sprott is able to issue shares once again, it will now be able to buy more uranium out of the market than anyone thought possible. $180-$200 is entirely possible here as a blow off top (currently at $45 a pound).\n\nAnd this is a minuscule market, so sprott\u2019s buying directly drives the price up. And because market participants know the price of uranium is effectively guaranteed to rise because of this guaranteed source of pent up demand, they are are willing to pay for the premium in the uranium fund to get a piece of the action. \n\nThis of course only drives the premium of the fund up further, allowing Sprott to issue even more shares, buy even more uranium, sending the uranium price up further, exciting more investors who will buy the fund, and the cycle repeats \n\nThis is effectively a short squeeze where the buying is being telegraphed ahead of time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the short squeeze has begun, but buying here is the equivalent of buying GME a when it was in the $50-$100 range on the initial surge.\n\nSo what tickers can be offered up here? \n\nNot many, because the uranium space is tiny and WSB has a $1.5 billion market cap minimum.\n\nOptions? You can, but premiums are absurd now that the squeeze has already begun.\n\n$CCJ is one ticker you\u2019ve likely heard of, and it\u2019s the only one with mkt cap large enough to mention directly.  \n\nSprott Uranium Trust is the vehicle I\u2019ve written about here where you can buy uranium directly (rather than miners), and directly contribute to the squeeze, but I also can\u2019t post the ticker yet due to mkt cap concerns. It\u2019s also only available in Canadian and otc markets, but Sprott is trying to get it listed on the NYSE as well for the future. You can buy it via Fidelity and a few other brokers right now though. \n\nNorthshore uranium etf has lots of miners in it but a mkt cap of $350m so no ticker\n\nWant to sell shovels rather than set out on a mining adventure yourself? Sprott the company owns the uranium trust driving this whole thing and collects fees from it. Benefiting from the inflows into the fund as well as the underlying price appreciation of uranium.  They also have direct exposure to several uranium miners they\u2019ve invested in. They also aren\u2019t big enough yet at $1 billion to post the ticker.\n\nThis uranium short squeeze, powered by the Sprott physical trust is everything the silver squeeze should and could have been back in the first quarter.  If silver squeezers had bought the Sprott physical fund, PSLV, rather than ishares SLV, silver would be far higher now. Let this be an example of what\u2019s possible in commodities when physical demand overwhelms a relatively limited supply of available metal!",

Trading is in my opinion figuring out what the catalyst us and using that catalyst ti your advantage.\n\nHere let me put it like this spce had a catalyst which was that launch thing(space mission) . Tradrers bought a position before the launch and after the launch they sold off. Really it was right b4 the launch actually happened. But you see what i mean. \n\nShit nvidia had a stock split announcement , thats a catalyst for traders to buy lots of shares of it and sell off on the split date.  Again trading on a catalyst .\n\nShit the catalyst could be a TA for instance netflix was trading in a 500-600 channel. When netflix dropped close to its support traders bought into it as it bounced off the 500 support and ran back to the 600 resistance ... yall see?\n\n**Trading is finding a catalyst for a stock and then figuring out how it will effect the stock price in the short term and using it to your advantage.**\n\nTHis isnt financial advice.

        "selftext": "### TLDR:\n\nSimplex Trading LLC is the last remaining financial entity listed in the Bloomberg Terminal\u2019s list of PUTs for GME maintaining a file date for their positions of **3/31/2021**.  They also hold the largest number of PUTs (80,702 contracts), twice as many as second in line Susquehanna, and are the highest percentage out (10.550%) among those listed.  All other PUTs have since been re-filed on **6/30/2021**.\n\nI believe these dates indicate historical Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) activity associated with GameStop and provide an indication of what to expect as we move towards **9/30/2021** and onward.\n\n### Background\n\nIn January, February 2021 $126.6 billion of loans were said to have been repriced ([S&amp;P Global - March 12th, 2021](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/quick-take-us-clo-refinancing-and-reset-activity-surges-63108875)).\n\nArchegos was liquidated between March 12th and March 26th, 2021 ([Credit Suisse - July 29th, 2021](https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/investor-relations/financial-disclosures/results/csg-special-committee-bod-report-archegos.pdf)).  It\u2019s been said that the firm turned **$10 billion into an estimated $100 billion** worth of assets ([Bloomberg - April 3rd, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-03/the-number-of-the-week-is-100-billion)). \n\n&amp;amp;amp;gt; \u201cTypically, for new-issue transactions, the CLO debt tranches are collectively 10 times the size of the notional amount of the equity interest.\u201d - https://www.stout.com/en/insights/article/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting\n\nOn March 26th, 2021 the Fed reported a daily Reverse Repurchase amount of $11.4 billion.  By March 31st, the daily Reverse Repurchase amount skyrocketed up to $134 billion.  An increase of $124.297 billion. ([St. Louis Federal Reserve - RRP Chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/)).  This was notable because the Fed\u2019s RRP activity had been effectively dormant until this uptick.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nAs evidenced by the volume of CLO repricing in Jan/Feb, the end date of the Archegos liquidation, proportion of equity compared to total Archegos assets and uptick in RRPs on March 31st, 2021 my reading leads me to believe that Archegos was more of a CLO Manager than Family Office and that some of their positions (illiquid investments in junk-grade CLOs) were auctioned off and then repriced to SOFR at the end of March 2021.\n\nHistorically CLOs were priced off 3-month LIBOR but, out of concern the benchmark was being manipulated by financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is in the process of transitioning CLOs to their own rate called SOFR that is based on the daily RRP amounts ([Bloomberg - July 8th, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/growing-clo-market-has-a-libor-transition-problem-on-horizon)).\n\n9/30/2021 is 3 days away and represents the 2nd-ever quarterly refinancing of CLOs after the formal recommendation of SOFR was made by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ([AARC](https://www.newyorkfed.org/arrc)) on July 29th, 2021.\n\nThere is a process called \u201cWarehousing\u201d in the CLO world where \u201cCLO Managers purchase initial collateral before the closing date\u201d which typically lasts 3-6 months ([Pinebridge - September 19th, 2019](https://www.pinebridge.com/en/insights/clo-beyond-the-complexity)).\n\n**9/30/2021 represents the 6-month mark since Simplex filed their 80,702 PUT contracts**.\n\nGME close on 3/31/2021: $189.82\n\nGME close on 6/30/2021: $214.14\n\nGME close on 9/30/2021: ???\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile many of my posts have historically shied away from dates I believe the evidence here is too clear and strong to avoid mention.  Worth noting 9/30/2021 is just *a* date and, given the fact the average tenor of Archegos\u2019 contracts was 24 months, there could be many other interesting ones as well.\n\nJust a Retail Investor, not a financial advisor.",

        "selftext": "This post is going to be about why IRNT presents one of the greatest squeeze opportunities that WSB and retail investors have ever seen. Because the company has only been trading for 2 weeks, it's hard to analyze technicals other than volume. Thankfully, the short interest and float are the main reasons why this stock presents such a great opportunity, so those will be analyzed below.\n\n**\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier. You should talk to a financial professional before making any investment decisions and should do your own research\\***\n\n**Short Interest Stats and Analysis**\n\nTo put it simply, the short interest on IRNT is absolutely insane. Combine that with the fact that it's a newly trading company (and susceptible to more volatility) and has a VERY low float, and you have a recipe for an absolute slam dunk.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at Fintel and iBorrow desk. iBorrowdesk has consistently shown the borrow fee to be over 500% and the available shares to be far below 10,000. Similarly, fintel has consistently showed less than 1,000 shares available to borrow. Though some people don't trust these sites, the similarities in the data help to add credibility\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qubmtqnjxjn71.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e966aee1e3deb1b3f19bb4edfebeb4090e3bb1a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yuuj6skkxjn71.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97cbe756d2845006ddb0c35e624032935587c4a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0vhzl9lxjn71.png?width=986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=082680490a232aa61f456c8a4492050d51e5baef\n\nI'd also like to turn your attention to [this post by another WSB user](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/). This post analyzes how the extremely low float of this stock due to it being a new stock and the insane option OI presents the opportunity for a legitimate gamma squeeze - not some fake hype run up - a legitimate gamma squeeze similar to GME's first run up.\n\nIf you look at websites like Baron's they'll tell you that the SI as a % of the float is only 1.79% (about 700,000 shares). This is correct but doesn't tell the whole story. Because of redemptions and lockups, the actual float is 1.3m shares, which makes the real short interest on tradable shares about 56%. Interestingly, [Ihor's tweet](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19) shows that the borrow fee is asininely high, which again shows the difficulty of borrowing of this stock and thus the easy possibility of a short squeeze. 56% short interest is an amazing number in and of itself, but that's not the whole story. The thing about this stock that really gets me going is the options activity. The OI on options of this stock is absolutely bananas right now. Remember when I said that there are about 1.3M tradable shares due to it being a new stock post-merger? Well, at a $20 price, almost double that amount is held in ITM calls alone. THAT is why the stock has serious gamma squeeze potential. Remember, both the GME and VW squeezes happened because ITM options OI outnumbered the float of companies that were already heavily shorted - this is the power of a gamma squeeze. Most meme stocks that have been \"squeezing\" recently have been small short squeezes due to retail traders and HFs taking advantage of social sentiment. The reason that we haven't seen a violent squeeze recently is because there hasn't been a stock with options activity like this - until IRNT.\n\nAdditionally, you probably saw that the stock went up to almost $40 last week out of nowhere. Again, this is the power of a low float stock with high ITM call OI. If this stock starts picking up, the low float and call OI could propel it to meme stock legend status.\n\nFurthermore, data from ortex has also consistently shown a SI of over 300% and a cost to borrow over 500%, which is consistent with the sources listed above. Yes, the SI is definitely a plus, but again, the real power here is the gamma squeeze potential.\n\n(The above four paragraph's were heavily borrowed from the originally linked user, so please check out his post).\n\nMany people will probably not believe some of these shorting numbers and will consider them unreliable because of how new the stock is. That's understandable. However, if you're in that camp, let me present to you this: the NYSE's regulationSHO FTD list. Per SEC regulations, stocks that reach over a certain amount of FTDs are placed on regulation SHO's threshold list. This is a very small list and identifies stocks that are grossly over-shorted (FTDs being the evidence of that). GME was on this list for a very long time before it squeezed. So if you don't believe the websites's SI numbers, then you at least have to believe the NYSE's numbers about FTDs. When a stock has too many FTDs, it means that it is extremely hard to locate shares and repay borrowers, which is a sign of over-shorting. Here is the NYSE list:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5q0vbtmxjn71.png?width=2710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e76c960abd9f88936b898b3dbebbf5d82519a9cb\n\nNotice the second to last one? DING DING DING. Though being on the threshold list signifies overshorting, there is yet another thing that we can take from this - forced covering. IRNT has been on that list since 9/2. Per regulationSHO, after 6 TRADING days on the list (9/10), stricter location requirements for shorting are put in place. Take a look at the giant green uptick that we saw on 9/10. 13 TRADING days on the list and forced coverings start taking place where a market-maker is subject to fines and loses his or her market making abilities if this regulation is violated. 13 TRADING days after 9/2 is 9/21. Remember all of those call options I talked about above, well they will be exercised on Friday 9/17. So, let's review what we have: an extremely high reported short interest (you can believe it's 600%, 300%, 56%, whatever), an extremely low an restricted float, ITM options expiring on Friday that outnumber the total float, the stock being on the threshold list indicating over-shorting, forced coverings taking place right around when those options would have to be delivered. Again, this is exactly what we saw with GME. It's important to note however, that this is also an issue of timing - the stock is likely to have a gamma squeeze sometime late this week and through next week. After that, there's a good chance that covering could lead to the stock being taken off of the threshold list.\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nThink that IRNT is just a squeezable meme stock with no long term potential as an investment? Wrong. The stock is not like most meme stocks - it actually is a good underlying business. According to an article by a website not allowed on here (just copy and past the quote in google to find it), \"With the company\u2019s international expansion, M&amp;A initiatives, and cloud acceleration, under my most optimistic case scenario, the company is worth $55 per share. If IronNet continues to sign agreements with nation states and companies like CrowdStrike did, I believe that the upside potential is significant.\" The article discusses how the company's AI initiatives, cyber security focus, and cloud acceleration, all of which are some of the most important and up and coming technology sectors, poise it to go up in value significantly. Additionally, the company also just reported earnings. Though the earnings were lower than expected, take a look at the after hours activity - the shorts have no juice left.\n\n**Conclusion/TL;DR**\n\nSo there you have it. in my opinion, IRNT is an EXTREMELY good stock fundamentally so I will be holding it long term. HOWEVER, the stock also presents a rare gamma squeeze - short squeeze opportunity that retail hasn't seen since GME. The stock has an extremely high reported short interest, an extremely small float, open interest on ITM call options that outnumbers the current float, is on the regulationSHO threshold list indicating that it has extremely high short interest and possible naked shorting, has been on that list for a significant amount of time, and the ITM options that outnumber the float are expiring right around when shorts would be forced to cover their FTDs. In other words, an absolute grand slam.\n\n**\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier.

Investing in plays like this is extremely risky and you should do your own research or consult with a financial advisor prior to making financial decisions\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello everyone, yesterday I made a post about why I think IRNT is one of the best opportunities retail has ever seen. Generally, this post got very good reactions but there were definitely some people who said I was retarded and that the play was dead. Though I definitely am retarded, the play is clearly not dead. Now that I have your attention about the potential of IRNT and you've seen SOME of it's potential, I'd like to discuss the stock more.  \n\nFirst, I wanted to link the recent DDs of IRNT that have been on this sub: \n\n[My recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/poe2gb/irnt_is_the_one_of_the_greatest_opportunities/)\n\n[The post I referenced in my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/)\n\n[An update to the above post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pobzn6/update_irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_273_of_float/)\n\nThere are probably others as well but these are the ones that I based my DD off of\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary of the IRNT play**\n\nIRNT recently started trading. Websites are reporting a short interests of 56% 233% and all the way up to 550%. Websites like iBorrowdesk and Fintel are consistently reporting less than 1000 borrowable shares. Because of redemptions and lockups, the float is extremely limited to about 1.3m shares. Unlike most stocks in this position, the stock has options that would only be available to a stock with 10x larger float. Additionally, the amount of options that are ITM and are expiring ITM on Friday outnumbers the total float. In most stocks on this sub that have squeezed, short interest has been the only factor. This stock, however, is similar to AMC and GME in that it has a disgustingly high short interest AND the ITM options expiring on Friday out number the float. That is why this stock has the highest squeeze potential since GME and AMC. Additionally, the stock is on NYSE threshold list, which indicates that it has too many FTDs, which is further evidence for this play. Very few stocks make it on this list and it is a sign of over-shorting. The stock has been on that list since 9/2 and, per regulationSHO, forced deliveries of FTDs will begin next week. The aligning of forced delivery of FTDs, option delivery, and an insanely low float presents a unique opportunity. There has been some confusion as to whether this play ends on Friday or if it goes into next week. The answer is unequivocally that the play goes into next week - that will be explained below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Next week is the real play**\n\nThere has been great confusion about this play regarding the lockup period. I have had several people message me and comment saying that the lockup period ends on Friday, which would allow more shares to come into the market and would end the play. This confusion comes from how people have interpreted point 1. of u/stonkgodcapital first post:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6v7id3mcrpn71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278bdafec942c361184281add312aa739542f170\n\nI have talked to the user to clarify this and have done my own research to ensure this is accurate. When I talked to him, he confirmed that he was saying the redemptions and lockups will keep the float at 1.3 million AFTER options expire Friday. He was not saying the lockup ends on Sept 17. He was saying that the float will remain small WELL AFTER options expire this week, so when options must be delivered next week and the float is still small, a squeeze could happen because the shares that must be delivered outnumber the float. I also did further digging. I could not find a single source that said ANYTHING about more shares being added to the float anytime soon, lockups ending soon, etc. I looked at [IRNT's form 8-k](https://docoh.com/filing/1777946/0001193125-21-263381/IRNT-8K) and found that the lockup ends 180 days after August 26, 2021. This makes sense because that is a typical length for SPAC lockup periods. So, in case you did not understand: THE LOCKUP DOES NOT END FRIDAY AND THE FLOAT WILL REMAIN MINISCULE NEXT WEEK WHICH WILL ALLOW A SQUEEZE TO HAPPEN.\n\nTherefore, the real play here is next week because: the float will still be small, shares will have to be delivered next week and the amount will outnumber the float because of the current OI on options expiring Friday, and forced delivery of FTDs will also occur next week due to the stock being on the threshold list since 9/2. HOWEVER, because of the low float and high Reddit interest, I do expect this stock to continue trending up for the rest of the week - so we very well could see extremely high prices come friday but I still believe that next week is when we see the peak.\n\nWhat happened last week was after IRNT initially popped, then people lost interest, so it fell back down. Today, the stock got more interest and absolutely took off - that's the power of a low float stock. However, this stock presents a special opportunity because it has a low float AND the number of ITM options that could be exercised next week outnumbers the current float of the stock - that's why this is one of the best opportunities WSB has ever seen. If this stock continues to gain traction, there is nothing that can stop it because of its low float. \n\n**Earnings**\n\nIRNT also reported earnings yesterday (it's called a surprise earnings and is because it's newly trading). The earnings report showed a wider than expected loss. An earnings report of that kind should make the stock go down or, at the very least, be flat for the day. Being up 20%+ makes no sense, so the only explanation is that the squeeze theory for this stock is correct. Please note that this is a side bar and has basically no bearing on the play - I just included it because earnings happened yesterday. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIRNT is the first play since GME and AMC to have a disturbingly high short interest, extremely low float, and ITM options expiring in the near term that outnumber the float. This stock has both short squeeze and gamma squeeze potential. It is important to note that the lockup DOES NOT end on Friday, it ends 180 days from August 26. Because the lockup does not end soon (keeping the float small), ITM options will have to be delivered next week, and regulationSHO will require delivery next week, this play GETS BIG next week - we will probably see more gains this week, but next week is when it gets real. \n\nI am still in on the play and have no touched my position since yesterday. See my previous post for a screenshot of my position. I plan to hold all of my shares until well into next week. Depending on price action, I may sell my options for deep OTM calls at an earlier horizon to take advantage of next week's price jump. \n\n**\\*\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

        "selftext": "Are we done?\n\nNo, of course not.\n\nDidn't have time earlier, but wanted to explain how shorts are actively attacking your options positions and in doing so leave themselves open to future regulations. \n\n**Post summary (tldr)**\n\n\\- Shorts attempting to knock price below strikes are hurting themselves when the MM(s) hedge.\n\n\\- Short interest at 49mil should be understood next to the 97mil float of which 86mil shares are owned by institutions. This means that short interest in **500% larger** than daily trading float.\n\n\\- CTB is increasing significantly, by multiples now and the result of which is likely FTD regulation.\n\n**Short strategies**\n\nWe're seeing the same pattern after hours currently that we saw the last couple days.\n\nShort playbook\n\n1. Destroy momentum by shorting any perceived breakout (there were net 1.2mil shares shorted today). \n2. Market sell huge orders to encourage strike breaking and selling to also achieve this.\n\nBut... Didn't work so well, because when price moves beyond the strike threshold, the MM(s) generally choose to hedge their risk. This is well known, but I took some crayons to draw the picture to make it easily understandable.\n\n[Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/v2fao3x355o71.png?width=3219&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98447970ab5457d1f0ede10d79d3e2433eaf40bf)\n\nThis is happening after hours right now. I'm curious what will end up happening here. Short's goals are to knock it down below $6.5 by market extended close at 8:00pm set to render calls useless. From the looks right now, seems like it's not working.\n\n**Constrained float**\n\nThis is why I'm extremely bullish. Stupidly bullish.\n\nTurns out institutions own so much of the float that the actual daily trading float is only 1/5th the size of the amounts of shorts. That's right. **There are 500% more shorts than typically available shares to trade**.\n\n[Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/ck4kijx555o71.png?width=1509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f40592f07ad91ef0d443411775a8ba135b09f33)\n\n**Total float: 96,000,000** (Bloomberg)\n\n**Institution shares: 86,000,000** (Bloomberg)\n\n**Actively traded float: 10,000,000**\n\nRead that again. There are 10,000,000 (10mil) shares generally traded unless an institutions offloads which happens rarely.\n\n**Shorts: 49,000,000** (Ortex)\n\nYou read that right.\n\nThere are 49mil shares compared to an actively traded float of 10mil. Literally 5 to 1. 500%. This is insane. So what will happen to price? Nobody knows - but here are the price levels. Price moves quite quickly between stops since high frequency alto's run this all.\n\n[More crayons](https://preview.redd.it/hftm51m755o71.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f877a0800068d845c31bed37258c33e7fc5ce2b0)\n\n**Future FTDs?**\n\nAlmost assuredly. CTB is spiking - this means there is extreme demand for shorts and limited supply. FTDs are when shorts are lent to sell short but aren't actually available in the Dealer's inventory to deal out. When this happens enough, securities are placed on the [FTD regulation list](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=RegSHO) which means significantly more restrictions and forced closeouts - highly bullish to price.\n\nHere's the chart of CTB. \n\n[CTB spike](https://preview.redd.it/mkxzrfq855o71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d71c3b9894accd2aa6819d4bfcabef1f286432c)\n\nThis is beginning to move from linear to exponential and implies severe pressure on dealers to keep up with demand. In my opinion, it's a short amount of time before this happens.\n\nIn tandem with the reg SHO list comes our favorite short squeezes (GME, AMC, IRNT, SPIR, etc etc etc). Except this company has 80% institutional holdings and no lockups expiring... Think you can see where I'm heading here.\n\n**Positions**\n\nAlready submitted my positions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppf22c/sdc_80k_yolo_45million_short_shares_aint_no_joke/) and have additionally bought 8,000 more shares at $6.72.\n\nCheers folks",

But I'm having trouble finding logical answers to basic questions regarding the theoretical squeeze. It's a cult over in superstonk and GME subs, can't get straight answers. \n\nThe squeeze theory at it's core hinges on hedge funds needing to cover a massive short that includes millions of synthetic Gamestock shares.

        "selftext": "Hello retards,\n\nI've been watching $GME like a hawk all week and the correlation between volume and price for the past week is incredible and to me seems very, very bullish. Check it out:\n\nAugust 26th at open: Spikes on high volume (889k shares in first hour, goes up $10). It waffles for a bit  as volume declines and hits its daily peak at $217 on 851k shares. Volume drops like a rock for the rest of the day and it sinks back down to $203.80 at close.\n\nAugust 27th: Jumps from $207 to $213 at open, volume goes down then back up over the course of the day and the price kinda waffles. This one doesn't follow the trend so well. The next day does, however\n\nAugust 30th: Jumps from $206 to $215 in the first hour on high volume (547k shares). Volume declines for the rest of the day and it drops again\n\nAugust 31st: Jumps about $6 in the first 2 hours on high volume (315k first hour, 729k second).\n\nSept 1st (Today): Jumps to hit its weekly peak of $231 at open on its **highest one-hour volume all week**, with 1.09M shares traded in the first hour. It then spends the rest of the day tanking on decreasing volume.\n\nIs it just me or does this seem incredibly bullish? It seems if we had a sustained high volume event we could see this stock rocket. Fortunately we probably do, as Sept 6-8th are the 3 days before earnings. Once this thing hits WSB and news outlets consistently we could easily be riding the rocket. Also because you're all brain damaged, this isn't financial advice.\n\n[crayon lines &amp; arrows for our special readers](https://preview.redd.it/9y9o5d5sgzk71.png?width=1913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7912e178518b335e0a07490fce23d79aaf7a63cf)\n\nAs a side note: comparing this to $AMC is pretty funny. It literally tanks on some of its recent volume spikes. Biggest P&amp;D of this week and stands no chance to keep going up.\n\nPositions: 3x $GME 10/15 690c @ 2.90(?) cost basis, probably buying one last one tomorrow.",

        "selftext": "Everything here is not financial advice. I just want to know if someone can do it better.\n\n**Prediction:**\n\nPersonally, I'm banking on a quick crash of 30%-40% of the overall market followed by a lengthy recovery time.\n\nWith the public consciousness being aware of the rapid inflation, the Great Resignation, the ending of the eviction moratorium, rising tensions within and out of the country, scrambled supply lines accompanied with mass shortages, and blah-blah-blah, I think a lot of investors have their fingers hovering over the sell button. This, along with the addition of short sellers ready to dogpile on the beginning of a downward trend, should result in a sharp decline in several securities' prices. However, unlike the Covid-19 crash, I do not believe we'll experience a quick bull rally after the market bottoms out.\n\nThe flash crash of 2020 was driven by the fear of an unknown virus and the suspicion of an overdue recession, but once heavy government intervention was in place, investors had their confidence restored. This time around, the U.S. is facing a likely default on it's debt and dealing with almost irreparable internal economic problems, and the general confidence in our institutions has greatly withered since then. I think America's government is very limited with how it can intervene and I have trouble seeing the market whales and many retail traders easily jumping right back in after any announcement has been made; leading to a prolonged stagnation.\n\nNow, I am certainly not a professional in market predictions or knowing what the hell the powers that be can do alter markets. I'm just someone who likes trading and has been keeping up with the news. You should take this prediction with a FISTFUL of salt.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nSadly, my broker restricts much of what I can do (no naked options, no covered puts, no margin account for options, etc.), which restricts how much I can grow my account. Nevertheless, I worked a way around these rules and plan for a FAT gain.\n\nWith that said, I want to combine my money with borrowed cash from friends/family (people who are outside the market) and a personal loan, plus whatever my brokerage will give me in my margin account. Estimated leverage should be roughly x3.5. After gathering the capital, I will short the ever-loving shit out of SPXL (a 3x leverage ETF of the SP500) and use the new founded cash along with some of the account's original capital to buy ATM puts. Next, using a majority of the remaining capital, I'll buy shares of SPXS (a 3x leverage inverse ETF of the SP500) and sell deep OTM calls because of the increased volatility due to panic selling. What's left of the account will be spent on ATM calls of SPXS.\n\nI chose SPXL and SPXS for the fact they follow the very stable and predictable SP500, but with more bang for their buck. I know WSB isn't known for it's safer gambles, but with the increased risk of using so much borrowed money and a falling market, I needed something to sound somewhat safe and reasonable to place the bet.\n\nIf this portion of the plan fails, all I have to simply do is consolidate all my debt and then become Wendy's personal bitch boy for the better portion of my life, reflecting on where I went wrong as I shovel grease into the mouths of meatbags. If this portion of the plan succeeds, then after paying back the principle and one to two month's worth of interest (how long I think the decline will last), I should obtain a return of at least x10.\n\n***NOTE:*** *i failed math class. number may vary.*\n\nNext up is the stagnation period of the crash. I will be taking some of the gains out of the brokerage account lock in my win. The rest will be scaled into discounted stocks (likely blue chips with decent dividend yields and leveraged ETFs). On top of scaling in, selling iron condors would also be considered. If it turns out that the economy will undergo another v-shaped recovery like last time, I'll kiss goodbye to most of my winnings, but still make it out with a profit.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nAnyone got a better alternative for taking advantage of the market crash without going full retard and yoloing your mortgage in deep OTM Tesla calls expiring in six minutes? Am I overlooking an opportunity or flaw in my plan? Did you even bother reading all of the post? Is everyone still holding onto GME?\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nI'm certainly not a doomer (or god forbid, a gay bear), but I do recognize crashes do happen and I just want to utilize extreme leverage to make a hefty gain after it's all said and done. But I do struggle to make five bucks on a ten thousand dollar account, so what the fuck do I know.",

However what these posts do not mention, is that there are **203 million DeepGreen shares of which 55% are immediately unlocked.** I'm not denying that at the moment the acquisition closed and the 8-K was released on **September 9th,** the float was 2.7 million. However there are \\~100 million shares that have been eligible to be sold since then, so the **float has increased WAY BEYOND 2.7M SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE SPAC**. \n\n# DID YOU CHECK THE OP's CLAIMS BEFORE YOLOING?\n\nThe 2.7 million float thesis has been posted so much across WSB/Stocktwits/Twitter. So many times that everyone took it as fact. However this fact could be refuted with about 30 minutes of research on SEC EDGAR (free resource). If you paid for BamSEC ($35/month), you could have probably found the evidence refuting this in about 5 minutes.\n\nHere's my thread on why the 2.7 million float was wrong, posted on **THURSDAY when the stock was at $12.34 (stock down \\~45% since then).**\n\n[Why are people lying about $TMC Float?

However people just called me retarded, so I loaded $5 puts.\n\n# DEEP GREEN SHAREHOLDERS - DESPERATE TO SELL\n\nI'm not going to go into the DD on the actual company. I think most here understand it's worth $0-$2 max and a squeeze based on 2.7 million float was the main thesis. DeepGreen shareholders understand this too and are clearly dumping the 55% of their shares that are unlocked. They are probably writing off their 6 month locked shares as worth $0. But they are still making bank because WSB and stocktwits are driving liquidity for them to dump.\n\n# WSB DRIVES LIQUIDITY SO INSIDERS CAN DUMP\n\nThis company is such a fraud and valuation so ridiculous that several PIPE investors reneged on their commitments and would rather take their chances in court then fund this thing. DeepGreen shareholders know this and are desperate to get out. To get out at reasonably inflated prices they need liquidity or this thing will go to zero as they all dump. Que the hundreds of posts on WSB pumping this thing. Even the buyers today scooping up 'cheapies' at $7 will get smoked. DeepGreen shareholders are happy to sell something that is intrinsically worthless for $7. Heck they would be happy to dump their shares at $2 (and will be doing this in a few weeks I reckon).\n\n# BUT BUT CEO CONFIRMED 2.7 MILLION FLOAT REEEE\n\nNo he fucking didn't. Watch the interview for yourself and don't just take someone's word for it. He was very very careful to say float is low (subjective) and not confirm the 2.7 million figure that reddit is pushing. Also this is a fraudulent Canadian underwated mining company with a fraudster CEO who wore a fucking **T-Shirt** to ring the bell of the NYSE last Friday. So the fact that you all didn't take what he said with a grain of salt is hilarious. \n\n# QUESTION EVERYTING (AND GET REAL)\n\nIt seems like every post on WSB now is \"Reeee if we all buy alot of shares price go up.\" Zero sum games are not going to make WSB money in the aggregate. Hive mind behavior opens up WSB to be scammed like they were with $TMC. All it took for DeepGreen and other insiders to dump shares in this company worth $0 was a fake float number posted several times on WSB . The kicker is that the pump was most likely coordinated by the company itself. \n\n**To WSB's credit, it seems like most commenters understood the company was fraudulent and were only getting in on this for a squeeze play. However, if you know the company is fraudulent, maybe next time spend 15-30 minutes confirming if the 'float' supporting the squeeze play is actually accurate (SPOILER: IT WASN'T).**\n\nPositions:\n\n50 Oct 15 $5 PUT @ 22 cents\n\n20 Nov 19 $5 PUT @ 60 cents",

        "selftext": "The world is producing roughly 125 million pounds from primary mining, 25 million pounds from secondary sources and consuming roughly 180 million pounds, for an overall deficit of 30 million pounds a year. This deficit will only increase in future years, as additional reactors come online. If you want to quibble with my numbers, quibble away. I know I\u2019m off by a few million pounds, but so is everyone else. No one really knows the true numbers\u2014which is what makes commodity markets so fascinating in the first place. All that matters is that there is a deficit, it\u2019s a big percentage of total production, new mines are not coming online at current prices and existing mines have had years of under-investment\u2014hence production should continue to trail off without new investment.\n\nHow large are the above-ground stockpiles? No one knows. All we know is that they\u2019re drawing down rapidly and outside of government entities, most of the stockpiles are spoken for by utilities, which are using their uranium to fabricate finished products for their reactors. However, a new class of investors has entered the market and they\u2019ve completely upended the equilibrium.\n\nRemember, GBTC?? I remember it quite fondly. What if I told you there\u2019s another entity doing the same thing in uranium, but it is cornering the free float at a rate that makes the boys at GBTC look like amateurs? What if the free float is organically shrinking due to the supply deficit? What will happen as institutional investors jam themselves into a far smaller market? Fukit, who cares? Someone intends to conduct this science experiment; consequences be damned. Importantly, this entity is using an At The Market offering (ATM). Hence, it immediately produces free trading shares; increasing trading volume far more rapidly than GBTC with its 6-month hold\u2014making acquisition by institutional investors possible and driving adoption. Basically, it\u2019s GBTC 2.0\u2014issue shares to buy product. Every day. Relentlessly. Except, against a smaller and shrinking asset class.\n\nUranium is different\u2014almost everyone who owns uranium today, owns it because they intend to consume it in their reactors\u2014these owners are all incremental buyers going forward. In a market with a deficit, they\u2019re all implicitly short uranium. With an entity buying up the free float, they\u2019re going to get squeezed. We all know how squeezes work, but I don\u2019t know of any similar scenario where the squeeze was as aggressive or blatant. The utilities are blissfully unaware, they\u2019re eventually going to panic and pay any price for uranium as a reactor that runs out of uranium is just an expensive paperweight.\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust commonly known as SPUT (SRUUF\u2013 Canada), is the entity that has upended the uranium market. **Since launching its ATM 13 days ago, it has acquired 2.7 million pounds of uranium**. This is an average daily rate in excess of 200,000 pounds or roughly a third of global production on an annual basis**. If GBTC is the roadmap to follow, as the price of uranium begins to appreciate, the inflows into the trust should accelerate. Interestingly, there are plenty of other entities also purchasing physical uranium, uranium that utilities were counting on for their future needs. The squeeze is on.**\n\nAs expected, the utilities are blissfully unaware. Surprised?? I\u2019m not. Utilities are quasi-governmental agencies, managed by the types of fukwits who\u2019d work at your local DMV, except they enjoy stock options. The fact that they\u2019ve ignored the coming squeeze shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Inevitably, they\u2019ll demand rate increases to buy back this uranium\u2013it\u2019s not their money anyway. This is your bid at some point in the future.\n\nCommodities are determined by supply and demand. Uranium is a small market at roughly $6.3 billion in annual consumption (180 million pounds at $35/lb). SPUT has raised approximately $85 million in the 13 days since the ATM went live. It\u2019s hoovering up supply and is already struggling to procure pounds, as shown by their increasing cash balance\u2014cash that they\u2019re legally forced to spend. \n\n**Something is going to give here, and I suspect it\u2019s the price of uranium.**\n\nIn any case, when I saw the rate at which SPUT was issuing shares, I legged into a rather large pile of SPUT. I\u2019m also long a few producers along with some juniors for extra kick. (Please don\u2019t ask me which\u2014if I wanted to name them, I would have). Uranium just broke out to 5-year highs. New highs bring in publicity, which often brings in new buyers and the cycle repeats. I like buying new highs from a big base\u2014especially with SPUT out there playing Pac-Man. I pulled back my exposure all summer as I was awaiting something interesting. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see anything better than uranium for a while. Let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m suddenly back to being VERY fully invested.\n\nBy Tyler Durden - On zero hedge\n\nI'm IN. This could be massive.",

After messing around for a couple months I ended up around 40% up because of two tickers. Then I got into options. And went down. And down. And down. After two months was down 37% from up 40%. And I mulled over a strategy for awhile and liquidated everything and started over. Now I trade exclusively options. Mostly on the SPY. After 3 weeks I\u2019m back up 40%.

        "selftext": "**TLDR: MM's don't have to buy millions of shares at close. Options are hedged over their lifetime retards and not just with shares.**\n\nOff the bat, I'm not trading IRNT. However there are posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppzol3/irnt_the_final_stand/), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppurkl/irnt_what_happens_when_more_calls_are_exercised/), and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppnz36/breaking_the_market_with_irnt_the_2nd_saga/) gaining traction clogging up my feed and they're so fucking wrong it'd be criminal if it wasn't ignorance. Modeling delta hedging and gamma squeezes happens to be my speciality, I invented the model for it which notably predicted something you may have heard of. ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvjbuk/gamestop_melvin_capital_put_positions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3))\n\nI'm not here to make friends but to save a few people some dollars because the info they're working with is ~~flawed~~ outright wrong. Generally there's this idea MM's have to buy millions and millions of shares today after close. \n\n&gt;If the stock closes above $45, MM\u2019s will be forced to buy 5 MILLION additional shares. They will fight us and spread FUD because they know that they are fucked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If every one of them is exercised, market makers will need to buy roughly 9 million shares to fulfil their obligations\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;if we buy and hold shares to go above 45$ by Friday, we can trigger an **infinite squeeze**.\n\nThis is just fundamentally wrong and misunderstands how market making of options is performed.\n\n**Market makers don't just buy a million shares on the expiration date**. That would be insane and frankly, people smarter than either of us are on the other side. Some moron with a piece of chalk came up with the equation called Black Scholes. It describes American options pricing well enough so we'll use that one. MM's usually use a mix of binomial tree and Monte Carlo models but you can read up on those later.\n\nDelta \u0394 is the rate of change with respect to price. In the BS model that is \u0394 = \u2202C = \u03a6(d1). Now that doesn't mean anything but think about \u0394 as the %  chance an option expires itm (implied moneyness). This is also the directional risk for a MM who wrote the contract. **MM's have to hedge all their directional risk** for a few reasons not limited to 1. going bankrupt 2. taking positions against clients. They make their money from scalping the B/A and IV crush. (Options are priced that if \u0394 neutral, the MM makes money if IV decreases and loses if it increases)\n\nHere's the first important thing. The directional risk \u0394 of a contract is hedged over its lifespan. Not just all at once. So all those contracts people are talking about, most of them are already hedged.\n\nSecond, MM's hold both sides of the trade on the books, i.e puts and calls. These positions balance out in a directional sense so you need to look at the net \u0394, not just outright call buying. MM's can buy back the call contract on expiration with the put premium and take a much smaller loss than you'd think. \n\nThird, options can be hedged with other options because of this exact scenario. Then the net remaining directional risk can be hedged while trading fewer shares. Options aren't all written with underlying shares. Think about spreads. \"You created\" two contracts, sold one bought the other, and created two contracts on one lot of shares someone else owns. Same idea applies here.\n\n**So with that said we can take a look at the options chain.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snbj0jmwn2o71.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5198d95029bf0dd792fc5ae17e75eca96d2b1092\n\nThis is a good view on how the chain is moving shares around. The spot when I modeled this was \\~$41. The bars correspond to the amount of shares being bought for contracts of each strike when the spot moves through a $1 range of the spot on either side. The abnormal things here are the changes around $30, $45, and $60. That's not super helpful but those are the strikes the underlying is going to be pushed towards one way or the other. It's not going to stay around $40.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever I did do the math of call deliverables for today and importantly I did it correctly. If we assume that \"magical\" closing price of $45, then we hedge all the contracts $45 and under 100%. Everything else is zero. Then we look at the difference between how the contracts are hedged now to get the max shares needed to deliver on every contract.  This comes out to 2.34M shares MAX. Even worse, maybe 30% of those will be exercised. Probably closer to 15% which is 351000 shares settled. A bunch will be cash settled (bought back), atm contracts may not get exercised if it's a net loss, and if the owner is extra special they may totally forget to exercise. \n\nThere's the problem with the posts above. There's a critical misunderstanding of how market making works and its going to lose people money. Thats all folks. \n\nIf you so desire, I'd trade around the above significant strikes. 55c betting on 60 or a short play for $25p",

Here to officially introduce you to a play I\u2019ve been loading up on for weeks. The company is Genius Sports Limited, ticker $GENI, aka GENIE, or as Forrest Gump would say Jennaaaaay. You may be wondering why I\u2019m here? I\u2019m clearly (newly) rich, I should get a life. The answer is simple. I\u2019m a degenerate and it's short hunting season. Pow Pow. The FUD\u2019r of interest is forensic bitch and noted short seller Spruce Point Capital Management. These guys are incredibly ***unsuccessful*** in their calls so I take this as a major bull flag that they released a short report on GENI. Spruce\u2019s past successes include: MGNI (moon shot/money printer), DBX (DropBox), Nova (rose 88% after their post, talk about poor timing). These guys have the Midas Touch, ***anything their*** ***fungus filled fingernails*** ***stroke eventually end up moonshotting***; I\u2019m here to expedite the process. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kw02izf6xbm71.gif\n\nAnyway, Genius Sports Limited (GENI) is a tech company that collects data from sports events, processes it, and sells it to major gambling companies to run their sportsbooks (SKLZ, DKNG, Fanduel, Caesars etc). They are the [pick &amp; shovel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pick-and-shovel-play.asp) play of a rapidly growing sports gambling segment ([gambling record $44bn in revenue 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/08/10/us-gambling-revenue-to--break-44-billion-record-in-2021/)). They have 4 competitors (large moat) but only Sportradar offers any real competition. GENI has deals with NASCAR, MLB, NBA, NCAA and the English Premier League amongst others. They are also the [official data partner of the NFL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/nfl-agrees-to-data-rights-deal-with-genius-sports.html) holding exclusive rights; dump truck sized moat. Prominent investors include Cathie Wood, Mrs \u201cAverage Down at all Costs\u201d, Anpanaman \u201cGod Tier SPAC Wizard &amp; [wsb Yolo\u2019r](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/) (1.1m+ [\ud83d\ude33](https://emojipedia.org/flushed-face/))\u201d, amongst others (institutional ownership is 90%+). But, before we get into more specifics about the company + setup please watch this educational video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA)\n\nYup, I also love Christina Aguilera. So, gals put on your crop top and cargo pants, and fellas that backward fitted &amp; baggy jeans. Let\u2019s get groovy 90s style. Oh and Christina, please slide in my DM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bug2kfcaxbm71.gif\n\npls respond \n\n# Part 1: Fundamentals\n\nGENI is the backbone/infrastructure play on sports betting since they supply the  data that major gambling companies use.  GENI offers a suite of four products:\n\n* **GeniusLive**: this is a vertically integrated video service that allows teams or sports leagues to launch something like NBA League Pass. So the platform supports payments, live statistics, advertising, live streaming, and video on-demand, without having to buy a bunch of extra software/hardware. \n* **Sporttech:** Data capture, management and analysis tools that help leagues run their sport, unlock new revenue streams, and protect the integrity of their competitions. This is essentially the shit that has turned Facebook from some site used to scam on girls in  college into a company with revenues of over $10B a year. GENI collects all the data from degenerate bets, and provides the information gathered from them to their partners for future use. \n* **Sportsbook:** GENI provides the capability (but not requirement) to build out an entire sportsbook platform for their partners.  This provides all the benefits of having a sportsbook with none of the risk of spending capital on a field GENI partners are unfamiliar with.\n* **Media &amp; Engagement:**  GENI has the platform capabilities to allow their partners sports betting experience to enter into the world of social media.  You can chat in real time with other sports betters and complain that Nick Chubb stepped out at the 1 yard line and completely boned your 3 bet parlay. Through this platform GENI can leverage their fan engagement capabilities to drive advertising revenue and also promote future bets that may be to your liking based on your prior activity.\n\nAs  mentioned Genie\u2019s only real competition in this space is Sportradar, but Sportradar\u2019s [SPAC merger fell through](https://www.casino.org/news/sportradar-filed-for-a-highly-anticipated-ipo-on-tuesday/) after GENI swooped the exclusive rights to the NFL from under them -- ya know, the ole\u2019 Bulgarian ambush perfected by Vlad. \n\nThe NFL deal is pretty significant so let\u2019s dive into it: \n\n* **Expensive af**: Genius will [pay the NFL $120 million a year over six years](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/), with half paid in warrants making the [NFL own roughly 5% of GENI](https://www.yahoo.com/now/nfl-stake-genius-nearly-15-215504358.html). \n* **Locked in profit**:  Sportradar was pulling in 1.5% to 2% of in-play gross gaming revenue (GGR) on NFL wagers \\[[source](https://sportshandle.com/sportradar-genius-nfl-data/)\\].  Genius decided to go the opposite route by jacking up rates; asking for around 4% of operators\u2019 pre-match NFL betting revenues and 6% of in-play \\[[source](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)\\]. Operators are big mad about this:\n\n&gt;*\"They don\u2019t really have anything new,\u201d said another operator exec. \u201cThey are charging 4x for the same dataset.\u201d*\n\nThese guys are forced to use Genie\u2019s official NFL Data either because they are official partners of the NFL (FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesar), state regulations require use of official data, or the TV networks force them to subscribe to Genie data to advertise.  As of now, [DraftKings has already partnered with GENI in a multi year deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/draftkings-partners-with-genius-sports-for-sports-betting.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1628161383), PointsBet, WynnBet, BetMGM, Caesars, and Fox Bet have also signed deals w/ Genius ([NFL names Fox Bet, PointsBet, BetMGM and WynnBet as Approved Sportsbook Operators](https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/12973/nfl-names-fox-bet-pointsbet-betmgm-and-wynnbet-as-approved-sportsbook-operators)).  This leaves only Fanduel as yet to be disclosed, but likely already signed with Genie. Senior operator exec\u2019s legit crying that [its a monopoly.](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)lol. Sucks for them, great for us.\n\n* **Sticky**: The Sportradar deal was inked in 2019 and they got cucked in 2021. Sad. GENI is proactively making moves to make the deal last longer than 6yrs by hiring a good amount of NFL vets. Including [Steve Bornstein](https://www.sportico.com/personalities/executives/2021/genius-sports-steve-bornstein-1234637226/), he now leads GENI\u2019s US business. Mans spent a decade at the NFL managing the media strategy, and spent multiple decades at ESPN and ABC.  He also was the CEO of ESPN for a cool min.   \n* **NFL shills for GENI**:  This cannot be reinforced enough: the NFL\u2019s chief concern is the integrity of the data provided, and they are entrusting GENI, and ONLY GENI, with that.  They will also force anyone who wants to do business with the NFL to adhere to the NFL\u2019s core integrity policies by [agreeing to license all Official League Data from GENI](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-announces-agreements-with-four-approved-sportsbook-operators)\n\nTo put this in simpler terms: the NFL is telling the world -if you want us, you\u2019re gettin\u2019 some GENI.   GENI also issued warrants to the NFL (5% stake in GENI)  meaning when GENI is successful the NFL is successful so they are locked in and incentivized to push GENI to anyone who wants to work with them.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/l3e1xpncxbm71.gif\n\nThe reason I\u2019m bullish on Genie and jacked with shares/options other than the regular \u201c*it could squeeeeez*e\u201d play which I know, love, and bang the shit out of, and will explain this angle later, is because Genie secured the NFL deal at the perfect time. So, 3 yrs ago the supreme court overturned the ban on sports betting. The NFL has responded by moving its business model towards generating significant amts of revenue through betting. Sucks for Sporttrader, since for most of the time they held the  exclusive rights to NFL data, the [NFL actually considered gambling to be threat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)**\ud83d\ude31**, what a bad position to be in going into the gambling golden age.  \n\nThe NFL expects to make $270m in revenue from sports-betting this yr, and  NFL execs are super bullish about their future sports betting revenue, here\u2019s a quote from one: *\u201c*You can definitely see the market growing to $1 billion-plus of league opportunity over this decade.*\u201d\\[*[*source*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)*\\]* \n\nThe ideal sports-gambling legislation, the NFL concluded, would include substantive licensing requirements creating clear and transparent markets that protect consumers. Bets needed to be resolved using the league\u2019s official data (GENI!! - fuck you, pay me.). There had to be prohibitions on betting by insiders and the onus placed on operators to make certain that wasn\u2019t occurring. \\[[source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)\\] \n\nSo, when I invest I try to think of analogies that speak to me. This lets me invest in a more  logical and clear headed way. I compare this situation to the girl that sat next to you pre-OnlyFans. She used to eat ramen for lunch. A couple years later she has a poodle, a G Wagon, and goes by \u201cCyrstal like the champagne\u201d instead of Bernice. Yah, she twerking on cam because she found a money printer, the NFL will twerk to online-betting.  Analogy.\n\nThe whole industry will be twerking. \n\nCathie Wood\u2019s a month before she started yolo\u2019n on Jenaaay estimated x10 increase in domestic sports betting handle (the amount of money wagered by bettors is called \u201chandle\u201d), to $180 billion by 2025 , with revenue\u2019s for the sector projected to sky at a 31% CAGR. \n\nOne reason for this bullish prediction is the New Jersey example; since NJ legalized online sports betting mid-2018, they've seen online handle moon to $15 billion, 1/2 of this took place in 2020. (*Don\u2019t know why people would yolo on sports and* [*not options*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg9jpn/why_doesnt_everyone_only_trade_options_0_dte_spy/)*, but to each their own lulz*).\n\nSportsbetting is picking up so much steam, ESPN keeps their own tracker for up to date info on which states are going to let you yolo rent $ on Appalachian State vs Syracuse:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g68ri70exbm71.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95e3af4ca366eb8d64ba23ac0f970d51bdac69b8\n\nThere are only 3 states (Utah, Idaho, and Wisconsin - which btw if you live in any of these places - move the fuck out) that do not currently allow for sports betting and/or are in the process of allowing it.  Ground floor opportunity here.\n\n[Earlier this month, Wyoming Awarded Genius Sports Inaugural Sports Betting License - upping the number of states GENI can operate in to 15. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wyoming-awards-genius-sports-inaugural-213000130.html)\n\nSo clearly Jenaayy is a growth stock but let\u2019s look at the fundamentals &amp; also how Genie compares to the competition. (Genie, Jenaayy, GENI, Genius \u2026 lol sorry I\u2019m  dislexic). Ya so  Sportradar (Genie\u2019s rival)  is slated to go public this year and will likely trade in the $10-12B valuation range \\[[article/source](https://www.sportico.com/business/finance/2021/sportradar-ten-billion-valuation-1234623092/)\\].\n\nSportradar filed its S-1 a few weeks ago which provides historical financial performance.  Making some simple assumptions on continued revenue growth (based on historic CAGR) we can figure out Sportradar\u2019s valuation multiples which we\u2019ll compare to Jenaayyy\u2019s.  I\u2019m also throwing in Draftkings in the comparison as a high growth (but unprofitable), pure play sportsbook leader.  You can see below how the financials compare:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f6alqkfxbm71.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c25a5c75f0ca5b4498d9883053284138e273ec7\n\nI would argue Genie and Sportradar should trade at a premium to Draftkings as they have an effective duopoly on the sports betting data market.  Draftkings\u2019 sports book market is getting more competition from new players, which is causing customer acquisition costs to skyrocket.  HOWEVER, as more of these players enter the market, they\u2019ll have to buy all their official sports data from Jenaayy!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fk2cxfmgxbm71.gif\n\nLet\u2019s get serious for a sec,, below is a valuation comparison and as you can see Genie trades at a discount to DKNG and at a premium to Sportradar\u2019s expected IPO pricing valuation of $26-29 or $7.4B - $8.2B. It\u2019s expected that Sportradar will trade in the $10B - $12B range once it starts trading.  Genie should probs trade at a premium to Sportradar valuation given the enormous potential of its exclusive NFL deal over the coming years. Vauling Genie at a premium would imply a conservaitve estimate of $25 to $30 price per share based on the company\u2019s CURRENT projections..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f75x253ixbm71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a6d0efe77944fcd133102ba7e3424f6b93b026\n\nGenie reported Q2 earnings on 9/8 which beat estimates.  Revenue was $55.8M and EBITDA $5.2M vs. street estimates of revenue $53.8M and EBITDA $1.7M.  Genie tightened its FY2022E guidance to $250M-$260M of revenue (which was increased in Q1 from $190M) and EBITDA of $10M-$20M.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for i though, Wall Street analysts agree with their Price Targets:\n\n* Benchmark BUY $33 PT\n* Oppenheimer BUY $32 PT\n* Goldman Sachs BUY $31 PT\n* Craig Hallum BUY $30 PT\n* Needham BUY $28 PT\n* Singular Research BUY $28 PT\n\nThese 12-month price targets equate to an average $30.33 or 43 % upside from the current stock price.\n\nSome other data points:\n\n* Tute ownership 44.17%\n* GENI is in a $330M net cash position \n* Does it pay a dividend? Of course not\n* Free cash flow is absolutely atrocious - the company is in reinvest and GROWTH mode\n* Holy fuck is price to sales looks steep based on 2020A at 27.9x, but gets cut in half by 2022E at 12.3x due to massive growth\n* Positive seasonality outlook, very volatile but shows recently strong performance\n* Sales forecast looks great, with a forecasted growth of 126% from 2020 to 2022\n* First quarter group revenues of 52% year-over year\n* First quarter group adj.

Their primary claim is that Genius is a \u201cmiddleman\u201d with an \u201cinferior business model\u201d saying the stock could fall 60% to 80%, so a PT of $3.25 to $6.50. Well first off Spruce, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/uk0m1vhlxbm71.gif\n\nWith that being said, Spruce is clearly wrong. Given Spruce\u2019s history of abject failure I would go further and say this report is baseless FUD. So, why would Spruce put itself in the path of a runaway train like Jenaay? Seems crazy tbh. Welp they\u2019re known as a [\u201cSmash &amp; Grab\u201d short seller,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-jolts-activist-short-hedge-funds-into-adapt-or-die-mode) so these guys give friends an early view of their calls so they can front run the market before it's released to the public, profiting from the panic.  Spruce\u2019s hit piece was released Aug 5th, the stock rose the entire day and it\u2019s been in a legit uptrend since then, no panic lol. If this is Spruce\u2019y bois M.O. they just fukd their company and their friends with another horrible call.

More importantly however, is this rising floor Cathie is building into the stock price. She is known for having strong convictions and sticking to them. She\u2019ll buy a dip &amp; take the ride. \n\n[But don\u2019t take my word for it. Check out this big, green, dildo. Cathie, you bad.](https://cathiesark.com/arkw/trends)\n\nIf you need any more proof, let\u2019s take a look at the near-100%-of-float institution rate. It\u2019s almost as if GENI has an unconscionably small float that\u2019s being aggressively bought by diamond handz Cathie while the MM buys remaining float shares to hedge calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6qtw0aerxbm71.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b125abc619b0d2f3f96966ac63eff445603328cf\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ipnyrecsxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 3: Float and Lizard \n\nLizard theory has evolved since my [$NEGG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofojpw/whats_going_on_with_negg_a_ticker_with_35m_float/) and SPuRT posts. Other redditors have come up with extensions of the general idea. I\u2019m going to do a breakdown of similar data from past analysis, including FTD rates and float comparisons, institutional ownership and recalculation of all this data (differs from online). \n\nAs of now, the outstanding shares listed on Yahoo and sites such as [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/geni/statistics/) is 191.51M shares. \\[However, the float varies, with Yahoo listing it as 63.36M and other sites listing it as 58.66M.\\] \n\n**The current float can be calculated as follows:**  \nSPAC IPO:    27.6M shares\n\nUnlocked PIPE:   33M shares\n\nFollow-On Offering:   22M shares\n\n**Total tradable float:**   **82.6M shares**\n\n**Lock up:**\n\nManagement (34.9M shares / 18% ownership) lockup expires on 11/17 and the SPAC Sponsor lockup (6.825M shares / 3.5% ownership) lockup expires on 10/17.  Apax, the private equity owner of Genius (60.2M shares / 30.9% ownership) lockup will expire on 10/17.  The gory details are all laid out here\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img i8iutvjtxbm71...*\n\nThey also list the institutional ownership as around 44-45% but doing some calculations shows this is higher. \n\n**So is this an overcount or undercount? Lets see.** \n\n**Begin Math:** \n\nGiven **191.51M shares outstanding** as the general consensus across various financial sources, we can look into the overall preferred shares and institutional buyouts across several 13F filings and aggregated data on Fintel and StockAnalysis:\n\n**Top 3 Institutional Holdings:**\n\n1. Caledonia Investments - 16,305,582 shares\n2. Fred Alger Management - 15,046,102 shares\n3. Dmy Sponsor LLC - 6,825,000 shares\n\nThese top 3 holders combined have 38176684 shares or about 19.93% of the shares outstanding. \n\nThere are 137 other funds that also own shares directly, for a total of 63694543 shares or about another 33.26% of the shares outstanding. \n\nTherefore, institutional ownership alone is around (19.93% + 33.26%) or 53.19% of shares outstanding. \n\nNext we can take a look at the insider transactions. This has a general consensus of 19.25%, indicating that a total of 72.44% of the outstanding shares are owned currently. \n\nNow lets take a look at merger deals, ETFs and ownership through mutual funds. \n\nWe can see that the top holders for Q2 of 2021 in aggregate own 17,422,176 shares or about 9.10% of shares outstanding.  \\[source fintel\\]\n\n**Our total ownership of outstanding shares becomes 81.54%.** \n\nHowever, now we need to account for any institutions holding shares through these funds and for this reason some ETFs are excluded. Fred Alger Management has 15,046,102 shares of GENI yet through the ATFV Alger\u2019s ETF, they end up owning approximately\u2026 oh wait.. Lol\u2026 approximately an equivalent of 75 shares of GENI. Okay so looking at these ETFs looks like they have negligible impact on the float. \n\n**TLDR; The float for $GENI is about 35,352,746 shares or about 18.46% of outstanding shares.**  **With 4.14M** shares shorted this means that approximately **11.7% of the float is shorted.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvse6w5vxbm71.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab367a73760c2e67324adb2459b7797512f474f7\n\nFrom the FTD angle we see that nice giant spike with the price staying stable/bleeding up. This type of pattern I\u2019ve found to give more pop, and it\u2019s something I looked for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cudusyyvxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 4: Flow\n\n***Options Flow***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img q9vahxuwxbm71...*\n\nOrder Sentiment: ***Bullish*** AF. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3brekt. 77% of options activity over the last 30 days has been ***bullish.*** 66% of money invested has been placed on ***bullish*** bets of the stock rising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bya2smuxxbm71.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e21f20b87f47c05a5df9c39ede3b8005e30a33b2\n\nCall OI has been trending up over the last month, you can see an increase in OI for higher strikes as GENI\u2019s share price has increased 34.43% over the last month. The smart money has been betting on the price increase continuing. \n\nThe option chain: there are only monthly options, and the options chain itself is somewhat condensed to near the money strikes. This is all actually a good thing. It is forcing investors to streamline their investments into a more concentrated area, which has a greater overall impact on both hedging requirements and overall stock price. This is exactly how a MM or a shorty in duress would ***not*** want the options chain to look.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6d2c7huzxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 5: Positions &amp; Prayer\n\n20k shares\n\nx100 25c 1/21/2022\n\nx220 22.5c 10/15\n\nx200 30c 1/21/2022\n\nx220 22.5c 10/15\n\n# END:\n\nTLDR; High short interest.

        "selftext": "We can all agree. WTF was up with the CLOV pumping over the weekend.\n\nBut, can you blame their excitement? Wall Street, and WSB get more excited about a disrupting, green, or new tech company than a lesbian visiting phra nang cave. This one is exciting. We've all seen the DD, 140% beat on revenue.\n\nThe kicker? They've double their counties served this quarter from the last. That's only about 70 counties. Incase you were wondering, there's over 3000 in the country. AI taking care of healthcare insurance, come on, if Chamath wasn't involved, your tits would be jacked. \n\nWhat do I have new to add?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Borrow Fee from Fintel, WTF??](https://preview.redd.it/7ofafg1ybcm71.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb47ad5f5a9ae00f0656fbcd6006837d03aae8c1)\n\nDoing my daily rounds, just waiting for the next short report to come out on the 10th, I noticed this.

Why the spike in borrow fee? Maybe they hoped we were still as dumb as our early GME days, and they could drop it like a father holding a baby on Maury, just finding out he is NOT the father. Shorts are cornering themselves again. And I have a feeling Chamath has been moving the pieces around, to make the float appear more than it actually is. The floor has been met, and I expect a nice bounce tomorrow. Can't wait for the short report!\n\nOR. I could be an idiot. It's much more likely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHolding 80 12/17 $9c",

        "selftext": "Wen Moon?\n\nBefore I discuss what we as investors should be focusing on as we hold our shares for eternity, we need to discuss some ethical concerns that have been popping up and have some merit. We know that everyone and their mother is saying that the stock is going to {Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. I appreciate the recognition of $SDC from everyone across the internet and comparing it to the likes of $GME, $AMC, and a company that recently merged with $GREE. I can't mention the company directly because the visual mod marks the post as spam. However, there are issues that should be recognized that hurt attempts for a short squeeze. I would rather us as investors and degenerates focus on what really drives share price appreciation. I look forward to your criticism.\n\n**\"{Insert unsubstantiated Price Target} by end of {Insert unsubstantiated Timeline}. \"**\n\nBy making this statement, it actually hurts any attempt to grow confidence in a shareholder base to buy and hold. Please do not be the person that does this and if you see it happening, then kindly correct the individual. If the share price reaches the claimed price within the timeframe, then great! No harm done, but the opposite is what is causing the below two scenarios and is happening 90% of the time causing fizzle and not sizzle.\n\na.) Investors that see these price targets within the specified time frames being tossed up willy nilly will see it as a pump and dump and disregard any information regarding short interest, free float, Cost to borrow, and Failure to deliver. At this point, an investor decides to not join in a legitimate attempt to squeeze shorts. At the current moment, there are plenty of these investors not joining. Most importantly, the whales. Whales want verifiable information and are the reason why I'm making this post. Although your 400 shares are valuable, we need whales to take interest.\n\nb.) \"Please fly again.\" Do I need to say more? Investors/degenerates that expect a price to come and it never does. If the share price does return from a $HD sponsored short ladder attack it creates selling pressure from those that are scared that this is their chance to get out breaking even.\n\nc.) \"It only will go to x.\" This again causes selling pressure and may cause opportunity cost and chasing for FOMO and being in the same position as shown in point A or B.\n\nWith this being stated, let us get to the meat and potatoes.\n\n**\"Putting two and two together\"**\n\nAs we have seen from our friend on WSB that discussed de-hedging the tiny float as shown here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc\\_dehedging\\_the\\_tiny\\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqafty/sdc_dehedging_the_tiny_float/)\n\nThe user alluded that, \"*CTB spike predicts FTD regulation*\\*\\*\".\\*\\*\n\nI shared a post on [r/stocksdc](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocksdc/) discussing that share prices going up significantly lagged FTD when there was a bullish sentiment with a stock. Of course, the share price does not always go up immediately when it's being shorted into oblivion, but when there is sustained buying pressure and lack of turnover from the new buyers, then price changes get interesting. Especially when the cost to borrow goes from 1% to 40% and investors are diamond handing them shares. I remember a similar post on WSB months ago showing the lag, but I sadly can't remember the user to credit them. If you have the link, then message me and I will edit it.\n\n**\"The Recipe\"**\n\n1. High short interest.\n2. The Catalyst that the shorts are not expecting.  \n\n   1. Buying pressure will need to be more than, \"It has high short interest bro. Trust me.\"\n   2. Catalyst needs to be present to encourage other investors that it is truly a long-term hold if it is the worst-case scenario and the squeeze never happens.\n3. Increase in Cost To Borrow (CTB)\n4. Increase in Failure To Deliver (FTD) due to naked shorts with continual buying pressure\n5. Increase Share Price\n\nI know not all FTD are naked shorts, but these circumstances are different considering $SDC has \\~50% SI of free float per Ortex.\n\nThis is how you decipher if this is a pump and dump for you whales out there or concerned investors.\n\n1. Is there high short interest? If not, then P&amp;D.\n2. Is there a catalyst?  \n\n   1. Is the company expected to go bankrupt and it actually becomes profitable? Is there a major change to regulations or the way they operate that allows the company to make more profits? If yes, move to the next. If no, then P&amp;D.\n3. Is the cost to borrow increasing? No? P&amp;D.\n4. Is there bullish sentiment? It doesn't matter as to why or what type of catalyst it is. Is the buying pressure large and consistent? If not, then P&amp;D and probably doesn't have a true catalyst.\n5. Is FTD increasing from the most recent SEC report that lags behind semi-monthly? If no, P&amp;D.\n\nNow to some graphs! For those that are bullish regarding another potential short squeeze, then take a look below. Please know that $SDC could become profitable tomorrow if they didn't spend half of their revenue on marketing. They are a growing company that is creating almost $800 million in revenue with the only competitor being $ALGN and the monopoly that is ortho. Why do you think there is so much short interest.\n\nBelow are some nice pictures with arrows and circles to make it easier for some of those reading.\n\nGraphs being provided are from the i-borrow desk with the help of the Wayback machine to access some older Cost to Borrow data and the Securities Exchange Commission FTD page.\n\n**\"Changing Attitudes with Retail and Whales\"**\n\nWhat I mean by the title of this chapter is that by referencing $GME and $AMC they are completely out of the normal. It seems that there were huge amounts of FTD and ridiculous CTB % for both stocks right around April and May after covid-19. Right around September and October, some buying started taking place as a recovery play, and the DD on the consoles being delivered allowing GameStop to not go bankrupt started a lot of consistent buying pressure that no one expected(Catalyst). Everyone expected the earnings to be spectacular and they were! So, shorts did not consider this unexpected catalyst and the above formula took place. It did not happen in one day. It took multiple consistent weeks of buying pressure until the shorts were ~~bailed out by corrupt Wallstreet and $Hood~~ covered. But those investing in this were doing something no one has ever done. There was no confidence behind this play except for those that had high conviction. As you will see with the $GREE acquisition, the ape mentality is growing but should grow based on data as shown here and not baseless hype.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Circle references extreme CTB&amp;#37; with no buying pressure.

Yes, we know there were penny flippers, but you are telling me that was normal? I've seen $GME and $AMC when it was taking off. What I watched was anything, but \"normal\".\n\n**$SDC Catalysts**\n\nSo hopefully I have brought some general light on what to look for in regards to approaching a short squeeze and determining if it is a P&amp;D.\n\nNow for $SDC. Does it have a catalyst? I'm thinking yes on three parts. I'm leaning on number 2 heavily because that is the only thing it needs.\n\n1. The recent medicare news including dental is something that no investor could have foreseen and more buying pressure ensued because of it on August 30th. At this point, I'm not sure when this will pass, but the Whitehouse is quoted from the Washington Post, \"Democrats intend to provide a benefit that offers seniors financial assistance next year for dental, vision and hearing care while the formal benefits are set up.\"\n2. Every short is expecting $SDC to go bankrupt. Once $SDC tapers its marketing in the slightest they become profitable. Look at its peer in the industry $ALGN. Look at the P/S ratio. When $SDC becomes profitable I'd only expect a fair price compared to its peer in the industry.\n3. NBC Settling out of court for $2.85 billion.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/29/upshot/medicare-dental-care.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/29/upshot/medicare-dental-care.html)\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/01/white-house-medicare-dental/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/01/white-house-medicare-dental/)\n\nComments, questions, concerns? Leave them down below. See you guys Monday! And remember this does not happen in one day! Marathon, not a sprint. Also, none of this is financial advice. Do your own due diligence.\n\nEx nihilo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Positions.

        "selftext": "What's up Degernates?  The $DUDE here with my periodic \"Dude Diligence\" reports on $CLOV - Clover Health Investments Corp and thoughts on potential price action for the upcoming week.  Be prepared to read a little bit, but it will be worth your time if you're seriously considering trading CLOV\n\nI want to start off with a quick intro- I'm a long-time lurker here on WSB but rarely post.  I joined a little over a year and a half ago right before COVID hit as the subreddit was on the verge of breaking 1M Degenerates.  I spend a bit more of my time on Twitter and am active there if you care to follow me aka, The $DUDE  ([https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a)).\n\nAnyway, I don't want to make this too long but I've been trading for about 16 years which started with a single $2000 deposit as a college student in my early 20s which was a good chunk of my net worth at the time.  That $2K has grown significantly over the years through working, trading and has been diversified into real estate as well.  I work in tech for a publicly traded software company and now have few healthy trading accounts (primary trading, IRA and Roth IRAs) where I mainly swing/momentum trade some YOLOs and occasionally invest longer term if I feel there's a disruptive technology/company w/ high upside potential. \n\nOriginally I came to WSB for the memes and then quickly realized it was a really helpful community w/ useful crowd-sourced info, strategies and data in addition to the solid meme game.  That was before it exploded 10X over about a 6 month period time leading up to the GME and AMC squeeze craziness earlier this year.\n\nWhile I will say most of the info here is still good for the most part, you do have to dig a bit deeper now, verify a little more often and pushback on a lot more misinformation than in the \"early days\".  And that brings me to the point I'd like to speak about today.  Misinformation and how it has run rampant especially when it comes to Clover Health Investments Corp aka $CLOV.\n\nI've been trading this stock since late Feb and seen the many ups, then downs, then big ups again and then downs.  But more than anything, I've seen and still see the disruptive potential of A.I. in a dinosaur of an industry that is Healthcare.  Here's my fresh take since I know there are a lot of new traders/investors in CLOV and a definite uptick of late in interest to potentially invest moving forward... (Disclaimer:  I am not a financial analyst, this is not financial advice, it is solely made up of my own personal opinions.  I do currently hold a position in CLOV for obvious reasons once you read through this)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**STORY TIME**\n\nI'm going to start this all off with a little story...\n\nOnce upon a time, there was this new fangled company called Tesla and it was forward thinking and it was technology obsessed and was innovation first and they wanted to build cars.  \n\nWell, the collective good ol boys (GoB) club that makes up the automotive industry saw this quirky autist lead company and laughed at them and pointed fingers at their silly electric motors with \"auto pilot\" and weird frunks and batteries- WTF??.  \n\nThe GoB don't like disruption.  Instead, the GoB loooove the status quo- because they're on top and in control, so why wouldn't they?\n\nThis TSLA company didn't care that they were getting the cold shoulder and started to build their cars that were never going to succeed and they were actually pretty f\\*cking bad ass.  \n\n\"There's no way this TSLA is a viable long-term company- they don't have the recharging infrastructure, there will never be adoption by the masses and ultimately they'll run out of money, \" sneered all the GoB execs along with the know-it-all stock analysts, big banks, Jim Cramer and all his Wall St. buddies.  \n\nAnd then something weird happened ...people started buying these electric cars and buying them and buying them even faster.   We all know how this story ends.  The GoB are now scrambling to catch up and acquire similar technologies to compete w/ the O.G. disruptor.\n\nThis is what happens with disrupting companies- they see problems and their leaders are visionary problem solvers and refuse to follow inefficiency and the status quo.  And it's weird because when these disruptive companies pop up, you'd think they would be praised and their industries would welcome their new ways of thinking.  But that's not real life- instead they're mocked and told they'll never make it and to give up because deep down the GoB know the legacy way of thinking is in danger of drastically changing and all of the sudden the go from leader to playing catch up.   So the collusion begins and they do all they can to ensure there's a failure to launch w/ negative publicity, or just ignored altogether or shorted or all of the above.  Whatever it takes to kill off the \"perceived threat\". \n\nWell, there's another company similar to TSLA that's looking to disrupt another Dinosaur industry- Healthcare and healthcare may be the oldest most dinosaur of the dinosaurs...  This company is $CLOV and before many of you in here sneer and mock- hear me out over the next few paragraphs.  I will support my DD w/ data, Press Releases, Quarterly Financials, etc, not opinions...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER HEALTH IS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY FIRST**\n\nFirst and foremost $CLOV needs to actually be seen and recognized for what it is at it's core- NOT a meme stock.  Clover Health, at its foundation is a Technology/ Artificial Intelligence company that just so happens to focus on the Healthcare/Insurance space.   It is a meme stock because it's heavily talked about here on WSB, but this is actually a long-term growth stock with rapidly improving fundamentals, massive growth... and down the list, the potential of a squeeze, but that is secondary in my mind.  I'l Long on CLOV\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER HEALTH's MISSION STATEMENT**\n\n*Clover is a healthcare technology company helping members live their healthiest lives with its Medicare Advantage plans. On a mission to improve every life, Clover uses its proprietary technology platform to collect, structure, and analyze health and behavioral data to improve medical outcomes and lower costs for patients. As a company whose business goals fully align with its members' health needs, Clover works with members and their doctors to become a valued partner. Clover has offices in Nashville, San Francisco, Jersey City, and Hong Kong.*\n\nIt's a next-generation disruptor in that it has developed proprietary AI technology called the Clover Assistant (CA). \n\n**Clover Assistant Explanation Video:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k)\n\nWhat's great about this is that it integrates with all FHIR EHR's (Electronic Health Record systems) ...hospital systems, doctor's offices, pharmacies, etc. use to store and manage patient info can all integrate easily with CA.  This allows for real-time data visualization &amp; reporting at doctor's fingertips so they can not only make the best possible decisions for the health of their patients based on all available info across all EHR systems, but also concurrently make the most cost-effective decision from a business standpoint (improved margins compared to competitors w/o a similar type technology.)\n\n**Aug 10, 2021 PR Link:**  Now integrates with all FHIR-enabled EHR's\n\n[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs)\n\n**Sept 8, 2021 PR Link:**  Clover Health partners with largest EHR company AthenaHealth for seamless integration of Clover Assistant\n\n[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market)\n\nYou want to know what is also pretty f\\*cking awesome?  They could also potentially license this software to other healthcare orgs at some point, i.e. Software-as-a-Service or SaaS.  I work in this space and have been selling SaaS contracts for the better part of 2 decades.  \n\nMy previous company had a stock price of $15 when they were selling \"perpetual licenses\" aka, dinosaur software sales model.  ...when they switched over to a SaaS their stock price climbed over $500 over the next 10 years.  Did I play my ESPP during time?  Uh, you know I did!  In short... just this software component alone could have a massive potential if played correctly.  Of note, I don't think that is currently in the works at the moment, so none of that potential is priced in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET**\n\nCLOV plays heavily in the Medicare and Medicare Advantage space.  Currently citizens in the US are eligible for Medicare at 65 years old and about 60M people or 18% of the country are on it as of 2019: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xkm6dlk8o5n71.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48ef0dd7523641c089b72e8da7d0f9f468cb889d\n\nLook at the Baby-Boomer jump beginning around 2006 and that sharp increase.  It's expected to continue the rapid rise and if the eligible age is dropped from 65 to 60, that could add another 24+ Million (a potential 40% bump) to its total lives managed under the program.\n\nA unique component that CLOV has when it comes to lives managed is that it has a direct contracting entity (DCE) program \n\n**Info on DCE Program:** [https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/](https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/)\n\n**Quick Video on Program:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM)\n\n(...and someone correct me if I state this inaccurately) but my understanding of DCE (and it's by far the most exciting growth component that I've seen so far related Clover's massive upward revenue trajectory from Q1 to Q1 ) ...under direct contracting entity, Doctors are able to sign patients up individually, outside of the normal Oct 15 - Dec 7th Medicare Open Enrollment period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EXPLOSION IN REVENUE GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR**\n\nHere are Data from CLOV's most recent Q2 10Q filing on Aug 11, 2021:  \n\n**Total Q2 2021 Revenue was $412.5M, which was a 139.7 increase YoY** compared to $172.1M in Q2 of 2020.  $216.4M of that was just from Direct Contracting- are you seeing why I'm pretty stoked on this hyper-growth company?\n\nTotal **revenues for the full 2021 year are now expected to increase from $810-$130M which was reported following Q1 earnings to $1.4- $1.5B** following Q2 earnings.\n\nTotal Lives (customers) under Clover Health management at the end of Q2 was approx. 129,000, **an increase of 126.3% YoY GROWTH!!!**  This has mainly come from the DCE program since it has only been available to Clover since they were included in it along with 52 other companies earlier this year. \n\n**Lives under Clover Assistant management grew by 229% YoY.**\n\n**Clover expects a significant increase in total aligned beneficiaries on Jan 1, 2022**, when claims aligned beneficiaries for 2022 become active - Uh, you probably want to jump onboard sooner than later given this projection.\n\n If this alone isn't enough to get you to jump on board blindly w/ no questions asked, I don't know what to tell you.  If you can tell, when Q3 earnings are announced on or around Nov 11, 2021, CLOV could rocket if Q3 report is anything like Q2, especially with a couple of weeks of Medicare Open Enrollment being included in this upcoming ER.  \n\n**CLOVER HEALTH's EXEC TEAM:**\n\nTake a look, you have a mix of former Google, Uber, (remember how I said it's a technology company)  United Health Group, McKesson\n\nExec. Summary:  [https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/about-us/our-story](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/about-us/our-story)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER RAPID EXPANSION IN COUNTIES WHERE THEIR SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE**\n\nCLOV just expanded its market from 108 counties in 8 states to 209 in 9 states (101 county increase) as of June 24, 2021, meaning essentially all of the earnings data I listed above were from the smaller market, so growth will continue to accelerate rapidly\n\nPR Link: [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets)\n\nIf that wasn't exciting enough, shortly after announcing the new counties, they announced on Aug 3, 2021 they will be entering a new state, the 10th, with their new partnership w/ ValueH.  That state just happens to be Florida- the third most populous in the US and a huge Medicare state.\n\nPR Link: [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-valueh](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-valueh)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HEADWINDS, MISCONCEPTIONS &amp; OUTRIGHT LIES**\n\nMarket manipulation w/ the price is probably the biggest headwind.  CLOV, along with GME and AMC have got to be the most manipulated shares in the history of the stock market.  Market makers and HF have an uncanny ability to nearly always pin the price on Fridays just below the options Max Pain price collecting premium for them and allowing them to do it cycle after cycle so they're making up the cost plus some of whatever the borrowing fee is.  The more of the free float investors buy up and hold, the less ability they have to manipulate.\n\nI've heard people talk negatively about losses.  Well, when you're in healthcare, and we're in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, your Medical Cost Ratios will get out of wack temporarily and that is the case over the past couple of quarters.  MCR was at 111% during Q2, however, Q2 of 2020 (before much of the COVID expense hit) it was 70.1% according to their earnings report. \n\n[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db) \n\nFree Cash Flow (FCF) has also been talked about and has been affected as this company is in growth mode, however, it has improved tremendously: +31% from Q1 to Q2.  It will be interesting to see where it goes for Q3.  Definitely moving in the right direction toward getting into the black.\n\nAlso much of the expense costs for Q2 were one-time line items related to stock compensation and the cost of warrants to the company (warrants along added -$134.5M in debt)\n\nAs of the end of Q2, CLOV had $630M cash and equivalents in the bank, so they can sustain losses for awhile without issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HOW TO TRADE CLOV**\n\nOK, this is getting kind of long, so I may type up a more comprehensive list with more info, but I want to get into some of the anomalies if you choose to trade this stock.\n\nShort Attacks:  Watch out for what looks like a mass selloff right at market open almost every day, shorts always short millions of shares each morning to kill off momentum and scare paper hands and inexperienced traders.  It generally comes back after about 10:30-11am ET when the shorts return their shares because they're just looking to scalp 10-40 cents or so each day and then return them for some profit.  If we're buying up all the float, and not allowing them be be shorted, HF and short's wont be able to do this and we start to gain ground.\n\nWhich brings me to this- IF there's anything I hope you learn from reading my DD today, it's this:  **DO NOT BUY CALL OPTIONS ON THIS STOCK.  If you do, they will most likely end worthless on Friday's and you will lose your money.**  \n\nI know options are normally an attractive opportunity to get into a stock inexpensively because if it moon's at some point, you make a grip on a small investment, but I've been trading this for months, and seen it happen many times over- you will lose your money.  \n\nInstead, BUY ACTUAL SHARES!   Help buy up the float and HODL!!  This is going to be a volatile potentially few months as we start making progress vs. the shorts to jack them with an impending squeeze, options have not been working, nor will they, it appears, in the short term.  There may be some opportunity to buy and profit from options once momentum is in bulls favor, but that time is not now.\n\nI hope this was helpful, I know it's long, but if you made it to the end here, really consider getting into this stock, it has a lot of things going for it and it's only $8 right now.  Even without the squeeze potential that exists, this could easily be $20-30 with it's extremely rapid growth of their Direct Contracting.  If you're holding it long, then when the squeeze does happen, it's just gravy.  \n\nI may have missed a few things, but if so, I'll just follow this up with another post here in the next day or two.  Would love to hear all of your feedback and/or differing opinions on this.  Happy investing fellow autists!!!",

        "selftext": "Lately, we've had a lot of P&amp;D type stock activity, with a fast run up, and then a total bleed out. Su\\*\\*\\*rt dot com was one of these, as were any number of garbage SPACs. Kodak was one of the original best examples of this. These are usually pumped by suspicious accounts, with lots of award giving to get them to the top, and then unceremoniously dump later if they do pump. What they all have in common is very small float, and this is a very tradeable weakness for a bear. \n\nMy view is that spotting that something will pump is pretty tricky. Even if gamma is set up right, and the float is tin usually on some sort of absurd mega short squeeze thesis, it may just not happen. However, it's VERY easy to spot something once it has pumped on a thin float. From there, you'll see the usual pumpers out there declaring it will go another 300% or whatever. But the best trade on these is to figure out when the float will increase, and confirm that the new float constitutes motivated sellers. If you can confirm when, and have a good theory for why people will sell from insane prices, you have a rock solid position to buy puts on (and can choose ITM or OTM depending on the particulars, but always with some buffer on timing). You usually have hours or days to position after this knowledge has become public, as was the case with IRNT earlier this week (That is still in progress, by the way...). Kodak gave you a full 3 weeks to play it. The scammy \"clean\" \"alternative currency\" company also gave you two days. It's a consistent source of bear wealth.\n\nSo how do you spot this? Well, here's a hint from the SEC:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sage wisdom for the ages RH](https://preview.redd.it/srdg17c8wpp71.png?width=915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba94afb89234618ad24ab5360dc7fcb036dfacb2)\n\nHow? God forbid, but you of course subscribe to SEC filings alerts and know what you are looking for! Nothign better than waking up and seeing your inbox with the catalyst that justfies yoloing half your account on one of these shorts. \n\n1) For that scammy company that ends in 'port dot com' and which no longer can be traded as such, they announced their merger timing. You could argue that the merger itself was sell the news (And it was), but once they declared what date the merger would happen, bears had a full two days to sell the shit out of the stock. Sure it dropped, but no where like it did after the merger completed and the float shot up 10x or something!\n\n2) For Kodak, note holders declared they converted their interest-earning bonds into stock. Gee, why would they do that when they can do it whenever? to sell of course. And sell they did - over a 3 week period, relentlessly. People said the IV on those puts was too high. It wasn't. It was a bargain.\n\n3) For IRNT, they just filed their s-1. Everyone knows once the S-1 gets an EFFECT statement from the SEC, the PIPE shares, and I think the warrants too, become unlocked. That's an average of 8 days. So positioning a few weeks out on this one is also a win in plain sight, since a 10x or more increase in the float will cause a ton of selling. \n\nI'm sure there will be more gifts like this. There's a committed group of people that think every stock is like GME, and want to BELIEVE that just once they will catch it. They predictably get scammed into running it up, and will hold the bag too long, and ll the while keep posting updates on short interest, and talking about how much they'll screw the hedge funds, and all that other garbage. Betting against their faith is a losing proposition. They can go a while. However, betting that a huge increase in float will wipe them out is just smart. And that's the play you can make over and over as a bear right now.\n\nYes, I am short IRNT. We are disclosing here now right? No current positions in the others.",

        "selftext": " \n\nListen up!  Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your money**.** Too much, or too good to be true?  Im being conservative. Hear me out.   \n\n**First, I shall Flex:**  \n\n1) I am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I can't figure it out, I know who to ask. \n\n2) I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.  \n\nWhy flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing matters just a little.  With that said, once more, listen up! \n\n**The Pickle:** \n\nYou youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is, there is NO effective treatment. \n\nThe FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has significant adverse events.  The risk of brain swelling requires serial Brain MRIs.  It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k.  Most incredible is that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the FDA still approved it because the need is that severe.  President Biden recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix:  $SAVA**\n\nCassava Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive function in its CMS trial.  The degree and duration of improvement have NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic. It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.  \n\nYes, we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc.  A genuine criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.  \n\nWithout getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere criticisms is Phase 3 trials.  There is no valid argument against this statement.  This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use absolute phrases.  If you take away only one point from this article, then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more about him later).  Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy.  Be angry, fellow apes, be angry.   Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal? They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\" A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit) out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.   \n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second, sold their shares.  SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog (https://ad-science.org/), Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.  \n\n1) Jordan Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that patients are literally dying as they wait.  WTF!? Why, why why??  If you aren't angry, somethings wrong with you.  JT states he is concerned for patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected, JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly. In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is horrendous (3% success rate)?  Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD in its purest form.  \n\n2) Then why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my position by 30%.  With that said, Im not surprised the masses started selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent, it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance. \n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue. \n\nFifty million patients are suffering from AD globally.  6 million of those patients reside in the US.  Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs $20k annually, just a bit over a third  the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment options).  The current stock price is $50.  The overly conservative valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia. \n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment. Thats devastating for patients, but families?  It's not uncommon for families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed!  Severely, painfully, and gravely unaddressed.  \n\nI have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process.  JT is only the face of this farce.  Behind him are many short positions making a 100 million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their short-term gain.  There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or short-term price action.  There is something much more sinister.  Biogen has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved.  Now it is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently, a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's AD drug.  This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no other therapy on the market.  Well, what happens if a new, more effective medication shows up?  \n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack to our Villian JT.  JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works.  Why?  I speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer.  There is little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less.  When that happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug.  Biogen already has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to rejuvenate the companies earnings.  Then expediently and as expected, Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI believe that is the root issue.  Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam!  A group of us have gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1) Im expecting the SP to bounce.  After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a perfect overreaction play.  If you dont know what Im talking about, you can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n\n2) Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"  \n\n3) Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks.  (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n\n4) Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted with utilization of &gt;90%.  It'll take very little to make SAVA move, big.  Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.  \n\nI have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on SAVA.  My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!).  I'll finish with one last piece of advice.  Over 19 years of investing, my most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual published results, but apparently, her opinion counts?  Comments of her blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on to something.\"  In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical details are fooling many.   DFV saw something well before masses, and he was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen, then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs. a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma. \n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor.  Do your own DD before making any decisions.",

        "selftext": "UPDATE: Expanding on my time horizon on this movement. Still in play and getting more likely by the hour.\n\nWe've been following $IRNT since the post market jump when it went from $16 to $40 in AH. It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.\n\nThe setup is simple:\n\n1. The float is currently 1.3M shares\n2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float\n3. Almost 100% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration.\n4. If the $20 strike becomes ITM, 2X of the float becomes claimed instantly. That is more shares than currently exist and rapidly speeds up the squeeze.\n5. It is currently unknown how many shorts exist, but the hard-to-borrow fee is nearing 700% and indication that there is some sort of short interest at play.\n\nIf $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of PHUN, OPGO &amp; GME.\n\n$IRNT will very likely run some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.\n\nDISCLOSURE: I have 600 17.5 Strike calls for Sep 17th &amp; 1000 37 Strike calls for Sep 17th.  \nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.  \n\n\nThanks to /u/Undercover_in_SF for the original DD on this play.

The investment (\"YOLO\") below is a large but recoverable percent of my portfolio, in-line with my personal risk tolerance. Not intended as investment advice. I may modify (add, reduce, or even close out) my position at any time.*\n\n**TL/DR:** AAWW is critically undervalued. COVID has all but annihilated international air travel volumes, driving up the price of air freight. Short term shipping disruptions have caused prices to soar, spilling over in to the air freight market. Analysts are expecting this disruption to resolve quickly, but are missing the shifts that airlines are making to narrow body jets and the impact on air freight. AAWW will have high earnings for years, and its current P/E of 4 is a joke. 13.6% of the float is shorted, and Atlas Air is free to reinitiate buybacks at the end of this month. AAWW's market cap could double and it still would trade at the rock bottom P/E of 8. Bullish AF.\n\n\\------\n\n**Thesis**\n\nAtlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.\n\n**Background**\n\nAtlas Air is an outsourced air services company that provides charter and other air services (\"Airline Operations\") as well as leasing out their owned aircraft. Critically, the Airline Operations account for the vast majority of revenues (&gt;95%), and AAWW has a very, very heavy focus and exposure to air freight.\n\nYou may know that commercial flights also typically carry cargo. When COVID decimated international air travel, it left a few limited carriers to ship air freight internationally. Atlas Air filled that void and is making big money doing it.\n\n**Short Term Prospects**\n\nBeyond the COVID situation mentioned above, oceanliners have been backed up dramatically causing a squeeze in ocean freight prices. Normally, air freight costs very roughly 4-5x that of an oceanliner. But with surging rates from oceanliners, [air freight has now become competitive for many companies](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/a-perfect-storm-for-container-shipping/21804500) and it is spilling over in to a squeeze on air freight. [Here's another article joking about car tires flying first class.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/air-cargo-boom-has-car-tires-flying-first-class-11630242001) So we know that Atlas Air is going to have a pretty stellar third quarter. One for their corporate history books, to be sure. But how do they fare long-term?\n\n**Long Term Prospects**\n\nAs a side note, I believe this is where the shorts are getting it very, very wrong. *I think* they are confident that while AAWW will have a great quarter, the freight rates will come back down again and AAWW will operate with only 'modest' profits like it did pre-COVID. What they are missing is a huge transformation in the airline industry from wide-body to narrow-body jets. Narrow-body jets carry far less cargo. Greenlight Capital did a fantastic job laying this out in it's July 26, 2021 investor letter (page 4, \"Air Freight\"):\n\n&gt;While there has been some recovery in passenger aviation, airlines are emphasizing narrow-body planes, which carry less freight than wide-body planes. Compared to 2019, current air freight demand is about 10% higher and capacity is about 10% lower. The result is that cargo rates have exploded.  \nSupply will be slow to come on-line. Some passenger planes are being converted to freighters, but conversion capacity for wide-bodies is limited and the aggregate impact of this will be modest. Meanwhile, air freight companies trade at tiny multiples of what investors assume to be peak profits. The implied cost of equity is quite high, which makes it difficult to justify adding assets. As a result, air freight companies are in no rush to order new planes, and in any case, new orders would take several years to build. The result is rates and profits are likely to be higher than expected for quite some time.\n\n(Sorry, I tried to link the letter but the spam bot didn't like the URL.)\n\n**Short Interest**\n\nFor some reason I will never understand, at a P/E of 4 with incredible foreseeable cashflows, some people have decided to short 13.6% of the outstanding shares. To be clear, this is not GameStop. But it is a high short interest in a stock with earnings prospects surging by the day as freight rates increase. It certainly doesn't hurt. But the story gets even better...\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts**\n\nOkay, so perhaps you believe me that AAWW is critically undervalued, that they're going to make some amazing Q3/Q4 profits, and that their long term prospects are pretty fantastic too. What will drive this rapid revaluation in the coming months? The answer was subtly slipped in to the last earnings call (google \"AAWW Transcripts Q2\u00a02021 Earnings Call\"). Spencer Schwartz, the EVP and CFO answered a question and stated:\n\n&gt;As far as the CARES Act restrictions, so the restrictions with regard to not being able to pay dividends or repurchasing shares, those expire at the end of September.\n\nI simply cannot imagine that in this time of record earnings, AAWW will not return that value to shareholders. If they were to announce a share buyback once the CARES Act restrictions lap, we could see AAWW finally get to a reasonable share price. I truly believe this could double in the short-term.\n\n**YOLO**\n\n$108k YOLO on Calls expiring in October and January.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzuyru804pn71.png?width=1268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82071fc0ff9d130964a81c208de196c9edc0d71f",

Technically Anal**\n\nSo this past week saw a considerable breakout of the $9 resistance wall and a concomitant FOMOing into the ticker with FD's destined to Lambo or Burn. Well those FDs are either now ash or in a giant gasoline-soaked pyre, but let's have a look at the charts to see if any of the poor bastards holding 9/17 $17 calls can be saved.\n\nFirst, a general look at the important lines:\n\n[So many lines, so much value](https://preview.redd.it/cnrsj3ehy2n71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95d5beb400d7024a6196736106457fd6c843879)\n\nThe most important level on here is the one I've labeled \"Launch #1\", though at this point the \"#1\" is looking smidgen unnecessary. First established on the gap-down on Oct. 6 of last year, it provided resistance on three occasions afterward (yellow arrows for the simpletons), with the last ending in a massive breakout to all-time highs.\n\nThe $9.08 line is the second most important line on the chart, in my possibly chromosome-deficient opinion. First established on Mar. 15 of this year after the bounce from all-time lows, it provided some level of resistance immediately afterward, but in the post *squeeze-that-wasn't-a-squeeze* world of the past few months it has become the ultimate resistance, a titanic, 700-foot wall of ice and sorrow towering over the pitiable bag holders huddling beneath its monstrously cold heights. Before this week, there were three prior attempts so surmount the Wall, all ending failure.\n\nOf next and most immediate importance is the $8 mark. I have it as $7.94 as there is a small case for its origin story beginning on Mar. 25 of this year. However, like the $9 mark, its true importance has been found recently, and ***cannot be overstated***: This line, however pitiful, represents a **higher low** and thus holding that line is of critical importance for the prospects of any near-term upward action.\n\nThe orange downtrend line was the last of the downtrend lines, and crossing it resulted in the most recent attempt at the Wall of $9.\n\nThe green line is **the bottom**, a place of green pastures and buxom women, where the burdens of your bags will vanish away . . . because you've passed from this world and its worries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext is a chart looking at the $11.13 mark:\n\n[Fibonacci, because Italian people](https://preview.redd.it/86tdxc76z2n71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b1f1e37ef85a53788c7100bddb17f9d64889a2)\n\nAs shown, the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $11.13 is shaping up to be a very important line. Indeed, it is soon to over shadow the $11.80 breakout line in that regard. On the dump following the June push, the ticker found support at $11.16 on Jun. 21, and subsequently it opened and dumped down from that level on a Jul. 6 (yellow arrows for simpletons). And just this week we saw the ticker reach up to **exactly** $11.13, before getting summarily thrown back off the top of the Wall. At this point, I think a breakout of $11.13 probably results in a significant push up. But we're getting well ahead of ourselves with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a TA wunderkind, I've turned my head to just the right angle and found a sliver of hope for the hopeless Men of the Watch:\n\n[Two girls &amp; a cup: can't possibly fail](https://preview.redd.it/ary603egz2n71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4e5b5f27b60656be73760dee5251e0e1d79e6b8)\n\nThe good news is it looks like a cup &amp; handle formation. The bad news is that *usually* a cup &amp; handle is a pause in an uptrend. Here, however, you have a downtrend into the cup (the giant pink arrow for the simpletons). This is a great example of Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart &amp; indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear. So, let's just call this a positive, because we have little else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at 1hr chart, let's see if we can find some more copium:\n\n[I see Higher Lows from my house!](https://preview.redd.it/dyaiz8hnz2n71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f6ec421727eeedc62a68c18d33c86a25cd03e9d)\n\nAfter the post earnings dump, CLOV briefly had a breakdown below the $8 support before rallying back up to test the $9 Wall, repeatedly. In that time, it found itself in a new channel between $8.40 and $8.60, thus establishing $8.40 as a **new, higher low**. This, as much as the Great YOLO Brigade of Labor Day Weekend, was the cause of the breakout on Tuesday. Basically, the chart was screaming that a breakout was incoming, YOLO brigade be damned.\n\nThe copium for next week is whether or not another higher low can be put in at $8.60. Like any good Man of the Bag Watch I have to hope it can, because if I try to leave, my portfolio gets hunted down and beheaded.\n\nThe worse and therefore more likely scenario is a breakdown all the way back to $8, undoing several weeks worth of upward progress. The absolute worst case is a *true* failure of $8 and a return to all-time lows. This would be a dagger in the heart, and unless someone knows a Red Woman, we're fucked.\n\n[Winning, winning so fuckin' hard right now](https://preview.redd.it/8zf0arxvz2n71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55ff09023716e9894e0f4fd672ec56fa1d4808de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 2. Dynamically-expanding Dildos** **^((for maximum gapping)****)**\n\nIn true Clovtard fashion, my knowledge of this company prior to purchasing shares was \"it does some techy stuff with healthcare.\" Which, it turns out, is basically all you need to know. This company is one of those that seems complex and super high-tech, but in reality is more basic bitch than your average Instagram thot. That being said, it might still work out for them... after all, do you see some of these basic bitches that blow up on Instagram? Living proof that ***literally anything*** is possible.\n\nBut just in case someone cares (and to keep the Clovtards from reeing in the comments), here's a look at the company underlying the CLOV:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Business Model***\n\n* **TL;DR: they sell insurance to old people &amp; process payment claims from doctors**\n\nClover sell two products:\n\n1. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which are just insurance plans for people on Medicare that include extra services along with the Medicare stuff, and\n2. Direct Contracting (DC) plans, which are one of several alternative payment models recently put forth by CMS (the people that run Medicare)\n\nThe important difference between these is that Medicare Advantage is an insurance plan where the ***patient*** is Clover's customer and Direct Contracting is where the ***doctor*** is Clover's customer. With the latter, Clover is acting as, essentially, a *payment processor* for the doctor's Medicare patients. This allows Clover to get a sweet slice of that government largess. On the doctors' side of it, they deal with Clover instead of CMS. Supposedly the whole scheme (and this is one of five put forth by CMS in 2020) is supposed to save the government money (&gt;!it won't!&lt;). I don't give a fuck about that part; all I care about here is whether Clover can grow their slice of the pie. \n\nThis Direct Contracting scheme was a ***major selling point*** for Chamath when they went public (more on that below), and for good reason. Clover only needs to manage a single relationship (with the doctor) to grab up dozens, or potentially hundreds, of patients. This DC scheme should be (*on paper at least)* far more efficient than Clover's original business model, which was just managing MA plans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Growth***\n\n* **TL;DR: they can** ***potentially*** \\~**25x their customer base** **^((but probably much, much less))**\n\nSo other than **\"the squeeze\"**, why would anyone ***genuinely*** believe this company is going to have some astronomical valuation that would give them a stock price on par with the likes of United Healthcare? Simple: growth. \n\nRight now Clover only services MA and DC contracts in a small number of counties: 108 in 8 states. They are expected to nearly double with an additional 101 counties by the end of the year, bringing the total to 209 in 9 states. Since there are 3,000 some odd counties in the United States, there is (*on paper*) a lot of room to expand here. **This is good**.\n\nAs of their latest earnings report, they had 128,591 \"lives under management.\" (I think that is a creepy as fuck way of putting it, but I *guess* it's industry standard....) Of those, 66,566 were MA customers and the remaining 62,025 were *indirect* patients, i.e., the Medicare patients of doctors in a DC agreement with Clover. The total of \\~129,000 was a year-over-year increase of 126.3%. **This is also good**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Math time!**\n\nIn their best counties, Clover has upward of 25% market share (at least this is their *claim*); that is, they have a quarter of the MA patients signed up with them. But to assume they can do that everywhere would be absurd. To keep this ultra simple, let's just assume that their current percentage as of the last earning report is representative of what they can do. So that is 128,591 \"lives\" across 108 counties which comes to an **average of 1,190 \"lives\" per county**.  (Obviously, not all counties are the same size, but let's just use this average for simplicity's sake.) So we have:\n\n**1,190 x 3000 = 3.57 million \"lives\"**\n\n**3,570,000 / 128,591 = 27.8**\n\nSo, ***theoretically***, Clover could achieve **27.8x growth** in customers, and ***presumably*** a similar growth in revenue. (We'll get to profitability, or lack there of, below.) Looking deeper at this number, one thing going for it is that the number of old people is steadily increasing. But on the other hand, competition is a thing, and big thing in this space. To assume that Clover is going to have 3.5 million customers in 10 years, or even 20, is pretty wild..... \n\nChamath claimed Clover was the \"easiest ten bagger\" he'd ever seen (or some shit like that). So, even going with that number, they would end up with 1.3 million \"lives\" in ten years. Even this seems pretty high to me. They went from 0 to 62,025 DC patients this year, but it is ***always easier to grow when you're small***. Scaling is an issue for all businesses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Profitability***\n\n* **TL;DR: they'll make no profit for a long ass time** **^((if ever))**\n\nAs for actually making money, well Clover doesn't do that. Yes, they had a 140% increase in revenue, which is good, but their expenses are rising ***faster*** than revenue. Accordingly, they missed on earnings by -0.52, or **378% downside surprise**. In typical corporate fashion, their forward guidance is full of claims of improvement on cost management just around the corner.\n\nThere is, to be fair here, a legitimate reason for some of the cost increases in the form of covid expenses. Essentially, some old people needed extra care, while others *delayed* care until it looked safe which caused a massive spike in trips to the doctor. And when you're old and you let shit slide, it gets a lot worse and a lot more expensive.\n\nFurthermore, their basic strategy involves eating losses when they take on new \"lives under management,\" with the idea that they'll make it back, and more, further down the road with that same patient though the efficiencies of their \"A.I.\", Clover Assistant.  \n\nTaking them at their word that this works (and will continue to do so at larger scales) then it is obvious they will being eating losses for years to come. Allegedly, they'll turn a profit in 2023, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that. However, just growing their \"lives under management\" number might be enough to hold up the stock price.\n\nIt might **not** be enough, however, to keep the lights on. If they can't at least slow the bleeding, share issuances could be lurking down the road (queue the pump &amp; dump conspiracies).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Competition***\n\n* **TL;DR: they have to take market share from better companies**\n\nAs noted above, the biggest hurdle in front of Clover is **competition**. Despite the \"tech start-up\" narrative surrounding Clover, the reality is that they are marching into the teeth of well-entrenched healthcare companies. \n\nThe likes of United Healthcare and Humana aren't going to take lightly to little ol' Clov rolling up in their shit. With about 10 million patients between them, UH and Humana are monsters in the Medicare space and with that comes the ability to undercut the competition. Furthermore, all these big players also have their own ***magic AI machine-learning gizmos*** that do ***magic AI things***. And they already have access to more data than Clover on account of their massive patient base. \n\nThis doesn't mean they can just snuff Clover out of existence, but taking away market share from established players is a far different gambit than expanding into a new market. And it gets harder the bigger you get. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Shaddy Shit***\n\n* **TL;DR: Chamath is a shaddy af, and so is the CEO**\n\nThis whole shabang was rolled out in typical Chamath fashion. Back in October of 2020, in his pitch for Clover, he claimed they **\"already\"** had 200,000 lives under management in their **Direct Contracting program** (i.e., not including the MA patients). Except that was bullshit of the Chamath-degree. At the time he claimed this, Clover ***hadn't even started*** its DC program (it had only just been accepted into the program). \n\nAs their latest earning report notes, they don't expect to get anymore \"lives\" in their DC program until Jan. 2022. (This is due to Medicare enrollment period rules). So, rather than \"already\" having 200,000 for 2021, Clover will instead end the year with the \\~62,000 that they have right now. ***Chamath at his finest, ladies and gentlemen.***\n\nClover's top guy, Vivek, is also well-known for being shaddy. Though, in his case, I don't actually care as much. Back in the day, this guy ran three hospitals in NJ that were noteworthy for having the highest fees of any hospitals in America. Shaddy, but shaddy in the ***ruthless capitalism direction***. He gets a pass from Cbass *for this*. He is also alleged to have pilfered a company he ran back in the day. This doesn't get a pass, because it could negatively affect my bottom line. \n\nClover is the subject of two ***related*** investigations, one from DoJ and the other from the SEC. The DoJ one is about shaddy business practices; something about kickbacks. I also don't give much a fuck about this. The SEC investigation is about the fact that the DoJ investigation was not disclosed during the SPAC merger. All this will probably amount to some fines, if anything at all. \n\nOn scale of 0 to Enron, I'll give Clover a 1.5. Doesn't look that bad to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Technology***\n\n* **TL;DR: they have a magic AI app that designed to maximize** **~~health~~** ***profits*** **^((maybe))**\n\nThe last thing to mention is the Great Green Hope: the **Clover Assistant**. This is the \"tech\" in Clover and the reason dipshits are using #TelsaHealth. What is it? Well, basically a data input and analysis program. More basically: *Microsoft Excel with fancy buttons*.\n\nClover Assistant is used by the doctors (and many MA patients use it, too) to coordinate and recommend stuff. The Great Hope here is that doctors love using this thing so much that they'll sign onto a DC agreement with Clover, allowing Clover to process their Medicare payment claims in exchange for access to the \"**app**\".\n\nSo is it going to work? Well, it is ***starting*** to: Clover went from 0 to 62,000 patients via this scheme this year. It's a country fucking mile from what Chamath claimed, but ain't nothing. And given the potential for expansion into the rest of the US, and you have the receipt for a pretty damn good return on capital. But then again, it is just an \"app\".\n\nTo be clear, I don't hate the *idea* of Clover Assistant. Conceptually, I actually like it. The Clover Assistant basically helps doctors make sure their patients are getting the \"right care\" by compiling data and presenting it in an easy to use fashion. This is presented as an opportunity to \"improve outcomes\" and \"save costs\" and \"help the under-served.\" But I don't give a rat's ass about any of that.\n\nWhich brings me to the Hindenburg report, and the part about it that I ***like***. The report claims that Clover is using the Assistant to direct doctors toward medical recommendations that would result in profits for Clover (rather than the best medical outcome), and that they are incentivizing the doctors with increased payments for these outcomes. ***I love this.*** Now, Clover vehemently denies this is the case, but I (not so) secretly hope their lying here, because this is ***exactly*** what I imagine when I think of applying Big Data-A.I. and Machine Learning to healthcare.   \n\nPeople have ***blind faith*** in machines, particularly ones that they've been told are \"**A.I. powered**\" and involve \"**machine learning**\". Thus, you can use the concept of \"A.I.\" to persuade patients to just accept whatever the computer tells them. Machine learning is then used program the Clover Assistant to ***maximize profits***, which should involve providing the minimum care required to keep the patient alive as long as possible. (Medicare pays a set amount to Clover and they get to keep the extra if the patients don't use up all the funds). \n\nThe only way I could see to improve on this diabolical scheme would be if they ground up the corpses of their newly deceased patients, turned them into food and fed them to the rest of their **\"lives under management.\"** I'm lookin' for every penny here, kids, ***every single penny***.\n\n[It's made from options traders!](https://preview.redd.it/u4qd8tzo63n71.jpg?width=780&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e27a86ed516acbd906706d2e9440056b6bd90d3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 3. A Conspiracy of Idiocy**\n\nTypical of any stock ticker that gathers a cultish following, the Clovidiots are as well-known for their conspiracy theories as they are for their options expiring worthless. Now, most of these are the run-of-mill shit you get with any ticker: the Hedgies, reeee! You would think that this is the first time some of these people had ever bought a stock... oh, wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Hedgies!!!***\n\n* **TL;DR: it's the stock market, deal with it**\n\nSo, do the \"Hedge Funds\" manipulate the stock price? Well, sure, why not. They definitely shorted it, and then managed to cover those short sales with little appreciable rise in the stock. Back in June, CLOV was at something like a 48% shorted. Now the it's 15% and I believe it got as low as 7% before this week's run up. While going from 48% to 7% short with no appreciable rise in the stock price looks impossible, it's definitely not when you considered that a large percentage of the float has been in institutional hands this whole time. Stock goes up a little, they sell and back down she goes, welcome to a regular day on the stock market.\n\nIs this some grand conspiracy of fat cats in a room smoking cigars as they plan out how to stick it to those pesky Reddit kids? ***I doubt it***, but if it makes you feel better, whatever.\n\nI, personally, would worry less about the \"Hedge Funds\" and more about the Market Makers, as they're the ones selling you the options, and if they buy up the stock beforehand, they can sell out for a profit while simultaneous vaporizing those call options you bought from them. In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the game.\n\nCan anything be done about it? Well, no, not really. At least, not unless retail buys up a larger percentage of the float. However, with each false run up, I wonder if that exact process is taking place, i.e., more bagholders are being newly minted, and each, not wanting to take an L and just move on with his life, decides to become a \"diamond handed ape.\" Only time will reveal the truth of this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Us vs. the World***\n\n* **TL;DR: everyone thinks this way, deal with it**\n\nThe second great conspiracy of CLOV is that the whole of the internet is out to get it. This is proffered with the full knowledge that GME-Anon and Popcorn ***both believe the same thing about their own stock.*** Both also believe that CLOV is, ***in and of itself***, a conspiracy to distract from their pet stock. But GME-Anon ***also believes*** that Popcorn is an engineered distraction. And all three are ***also*** convinced that the Mods are out to get them, ***specifically***.\n\nThis is, of course, perfectly normal behavior. That might seem shocking to some of you, but the next time you're watching football with a die hard fan (or whatever lame-ass europoor sport you watch), look for their reactions whenever the slightest thing doesn't go their way:\n\n* *\"These fucking refs are terrible! They're totally biased against my team! They've got it out for us! I'm going to write an angry letter to the league!\"*\n\nSound familiar? It should, because if you look around with open eyes, you'll find this exact behavioral pattern repeated at infinitum across every conceivable human endeavor.\n\nDo people hate CLOV and the masses of idiots holding it? Sure, and I don't blame them. You guys can be pretty fucking annoying. That does not, however, equate to a grand conspiracy of suppression. The fact that your copy-pasta DD got nixed just like everyone else's lazy dogshit copy-pasta is not you being singled out. It's you not understanding the rules and adapting your behavior to play within them. But hey, maybe it's easier to just blame the Mods.\n\n[\\(please don't ban me\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7mfo4sa0q3n71.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00e9a245357f31fe49b1cf093303f400f411d546)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 4. Rise now, a Man of the Bag Watch**\n\nHaving taken a brief tour of Castle Black and had a bit of a feel for what it's like to be a venerable Man of the Clov Bag Watch, most of you are probably thinking: *Okay, how the fuck do I get out this chickenshit operation?* \n\nWell, you are probably still hoping for **moon**. In that regard, I've some bad news for you: ***there will be no squeeze.*** \n\nThere will absolutely not be a **short squeeze****.** At 15% short, there is zero chance of this happening. *\"But, bruh, the* ***real*** *short number is like 420% bruh.\"* Bullshit. Just straight bullshit.\n\nThere is also not going to be a **gamma squeeze.** Not anytime soon, and likely never. In order to get a gamma squeeze you need options that are going to be delta-hedged. But why delta-hedge options that are going to be Thanos-snapped out of existence by expiry?\n\nA while back, it looked like there could be a **mixed squeeze** (short covering + gamma hedging), but that's all in the past now. Down the road from now, could it still happen? Yeah, sure, and I could end up raw-dogging a Victoria's Secret model on the hood of my new lambo. All kinds of crazy things are ***possible***, but that doesn't make them ***likely***.\n\nAnd honestly, what the fuck is wrong with a good ol' grind up? Squeezes are fun, I get it. You get to see your money double, triple, 5x, 10x, all in the space of a day or two. You get to see those option YOLO's gain a thousand of percent in minutes. But you still make money on a grind up. A fuckload of it.\n\nI'm not sure I buy into this whole notion of a \"squeeze\" being the **Holy Grail of the Stock Market**. It's starting to sound like the Bears and their perpetual claims that they're going to make ***all the money*** on the coming collapse, all while lighting round after round of SPY puts on fire. The Squeeze Fanatics are doing the same thing, but with call options on meme stocks. \n\nBut, hey, what do I know? I'm just peon in this operation, a pitifully small cog in the great meat grinder we call the stock market. For now the chart tells me there's still **hope of up**, and so my bag watch continues. When the chart dies and there is no more good to be said of the company, then I will initiate my Bagholder Optimization Formula and there my watch will end. Until then, I man my post.\n\n[Tormund Bearfucker](https://preview.redd.it/dpx4byfpy3n71.jpg?width=961&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55407f36e295ce5450fa607f21dfa766fc2f54c1)\n\n**Positions or Ban:**\n\n[Maybe I can try crtl-z?](https://preview.redd.it/w59n919dx3n71.jpg?width=1667&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a10ed3b8aee187ad77f3d03404586278d97e8c4)",

        "selftext": "Hey retards, \n\nso ending normal funnies and jokes- here\u2019s something that you all will need to understand and hopefully help you on your tax understanding. \n\nNow it won\u2019t be much fun to read it but knowing it may be helpful to you at some point.\n\n1) what is wash sale rule? \n\n&gt;A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar.\n\nNow the actual way to understanding this is kind of complex and even out of the scope of this post. You can be held at a tax higher than your gain (some retard got a 800k tax bill in a 40k gain because of wash sale rule since he was trading same stocks 10+ times a day). \n\nBut do know that this rule, is made to stop shady things. It usually won\u2019t effect you because brokerages are smart enough to realize it and do mathematical calculation to your second buy to fix the wash sale rule instantly. But there can be mistakes. \n\nNOTE: you should only be paying taxes on your actual gain and deducting from your all losses (total after net year). If anything is wrong, see tax accountant instantly. \n\n2)  tax-loss harvesting\n\nThis is like algebra math where you try to add and subtract to get the best number. Say you have 2 positions, one in AMD and one in GME. You realized a gain (so you closed your position) on AMD but still have your GME options chugging along. Your GME options don\u2019t expire until next year but they are in loss. It\u2019s December- so you say \u201cwait, rather than pay full tax on my gains from AMD, why don\u2019t I close my GME positions for a loss and now I can subtract that loss from my AMD gain and pay less tax\u201d. \n\n3) deduction of capital loss\n\nYou say you have -20k realized loss in 2020. You can deduct 3000$ from your earned income every year until that 20k is used up. This means you lost 20k in stocks but made 60k in your job- you can automatically deduct 3000 from your income so now you effectively have a 57,000$ income for tax. \n\nNow some people are confused but this is only for EARNED INCOME. The 3000 deduction limit is so it\u2019s not abused. But say you have 2021 capital gain from GME of 15k. \n\nHere if you still had -20k loss of 2020, you can deduct the full 15k gain from 2021 so that -20k loss now is at 5k loss and use the remaining 3000 from 5k to deduct the earned income (from job) of 2021. For a total net loss of -2k still left for next year. \n\n4) positions that you hold for less than 1 year will be taxed at higher % than positions held more than year. \n\nThere are more Things like Tax-optimized Portfolio and many other tax implication that are too far out of reach for a single post but be aware of all these things. \n\nSPY 460c 9/10- free money",

Instead they kept buying hitting 1.2 billion volume in a day before trading was halted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Global leader in 5G networks**\n\nTo keep it short Nokia is currently a network company. Main competitors being Huawei, Ericsson and Samsung. You can still buy Nokia branded mobile phones and other products under their licensing agreements, but the core is in the networks (fixed and wireless). Heart of the R&amp;D is an iconic Bell Labs. Key words to current Nokia are 5G, edge cloud, AI, IoT etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Share count vs Market cap**\n\nNokia share count is 5.6 billion and market cap $31 billion (9/17/2021). During the meme action people figured out that the market cap 26.4 billion in January is what really counts, and this proofed to be right. It really doesn't matter if there are 5.6 billion shares at the price of $4.73 or 1.12 B shares with the price of $23.65 - exactly the same market cap.\n\nAs a comparison this year $GME and $AMC market caps peaked $37.3 B and $36.9 B respectively. However, $NOK didn't have a huge short position for leverage but instead it was and still is a value play with EUR 3.7 billion net cash and solid profitable cashflow. It is an undervalued quality stock in the blink of a turnaround. To give some perspective Nokia market cap was in January 2021 one tenth of Cisco's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Renewed product portfolio is second to none in the industry**\n\nLet's face it, Nokia had problems with 5G product portfolio development after it acquired Alcatel Lucent in 2016. Company simply didn't have enough resources to focus on 5G product line while they were busy to merge ALU and Nokia 4G product portfolios. So, they ended up taking a shortcut by using programmable FPGA chips in their products instead of more efficient and cost friendly SoC chips.\n\nEventually Nokia focused to SoCs in 2019 and it took two years to catch the competition with new Reefshark based products using SoCs. In July 2021 the huge workload was pretty much done and at the end of this year over 70% of shipped products will be based on SoC's and the new deals will be more or less all part of the renewed product portfolio.\n\nNow that Nokia has catched up the gap to the competitors in product competitiveness it is adding even more firepower to the R&amp;D efforts which can be seen as a good sign. Main target is to be the best network company in the industry and according to the management we will see some new exciting product launches still in this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Main competitor still banned by US government**\n\nUS has been accusing Huawei about close connections to Chinese communist party and sees it as a possible security threat. Therefore, it has been warning other countries to avoid using its products and about a year ago even banned Huawei to buy much needed 5G chips. Naturally the company bought as many chips to stock as it could but it\u2019s now running out of parts (much worse situation compared to January 2021).\n\nTheir mobile handset business is currently sinking (no new 5G phones at all), and it seems that for base stations it must start using less sophisticated and more energy consuming components manufactured by Chinese suppliers. So, they will be able to deliver products but at what cost?\n\nThere have been articles stating that Chinese government should compensate energy costs to operators in order to make the new products more appealing. Pretty much the same strategical approach which Huawei has been successfully using in the past decade stealing market share from Nokia and Ericsson by selling products even under the price of components. All this has been possible because Chinese government has been subsidizing the company generously. Sad side effect has been that even there are a handful network providers left in the industry it has been hard to make any profit. Now it seems that US ban is changing the game and market share is flooding to western rivals which can start raising their prices and margins to reasonable levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall the global situation is much different than it was a couple of years ago. It\u2019s too risky for operators to focus purely on buying less secure underpriced Chinese products as their own government or consumers might turn against them. For operators it\u2019s more important to do business with reliable and ethical partners. Nokia is a good choice as it has been named by Ethisphere as one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Competent management with can do attitude**\n\nPekka Lundmark is the current CEO following Stephen Elop and Rajeev Suri. He did a much-needed strategy review in the company about a year ago and since then the progress has been convincing. Nokia buried its end to end strategy, business unit heads are now fully responsible of profit &amp; loss and the decision making is not anymore scattered around the organization. All businesses are seeing growth and the change is already visible in the financial numbers even the three-year strategy execution is only in its first phase.\n\nPekka has also totally changed the company's comms policy. Nowadays Nokia is very transparent with its comms. It prefer to set lower targets and give surprise profit raises instead of promising the moon from the sky in the first place. The new policy might seem pessimistic to some but to be honest the overpromising strategy didn\u2019t work well either and shareholders along with analysts lost the faith to the company. We might argue that the current undervaluation is indirect consequence of bad comms and it simply takes a few solid quarters to convince otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COVID and future technologies supporting 5G \u00edmplementation**\n\nCOVID boosted the network usage globally and we are seeing growing demand for better networks with higher capacity and lower latencies. However, behind the scenes there is much more happening. Companies and research labs are inventing killer apps and products to best use 5G networks. For example, VR and AR could potentially be something to wait for.\n\nBig problems with VR/AR have been the storage, power consumption, and processing power. 5G will solve the problems by pushing these  away from the PC and into the edge cloud. Imagine the next Facebook where people will get a totally new sense of immersion with VR/AR. When this happen the consumers and companies will be begging for growing 5G availability with more bandwidth and lower latency capabilities.\n\nPrivate wireless use cases and smart city solutions are key parts to lead the next technological revolution with significant productivity gains and will grow the demand for high quality networks. Lufthansa, many ports and mining companies are already taking advantage of early wins to beat the competition.\n\nOh boy, oh boy when the first significant use cases for masses pop up. The demand for high speed networks will skyrocket and I bet that the few relevant network companies will not sell their products and services cheap now that Chinese are not anymore disrupting the markets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What analysts are saying?**\n\nAnalysts focusing on the company are much more optimistic than the market currently. Last week Goldman Sachs raised their target to 6.10 EUR.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClosing price (September 17): **$5.50** (4.70 EUR)\n\nTarget price: High $8.27, Median **$7.12**, Low $5.75\n\nBuy: **17**, Overweight: **3**, Hold: **9**, Sell: **0**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Peculiar trading activity this week**\n\nNokia stock has been arrogantly used to rinse option players every now and then by market players. It seems that max pain levels for option players have been reached time and again. Actually, this happened past weeks as well when the share price was pushed from $6.29 (peak after Nokia raised their guidance for 2021) to $5.50 without any negative news. Someone adjusted the robots well as the closing price on Friday was precisely $5.50 (maximum gains for bankers). Only medicine to stop this kind of activity would be to grow the faithful owner base so it would be more difficult for market player to move the share price. Eventhough in the longrun these kind of short-term movements are meaningless.\n\nWith these levels, next week will be a great buying opportunity for long-term investors who see the underlying potential in this hidden gem. Not even meme phenomenon is needed to reach the double digits in $NOK share price in the coming years.\n\n  \n\n\nDisclaimer. I\u2019m Nokia owner with solid position of shares. I see the stock as a great value play in a long run but I\u2019m not a financial advisor so buy with your own risk.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: not financial advice, I\u2019m literally retarded, bla bla bla. Also, mods, I mention cr\\*pto in this post, but not in the context of shilling some POS cr\\*ptocurrency, but rather in the context of an equity ($GREE) that mines cr\\*pto. \n\nOkay retards, time for your daily lesson in buying the dip.\n\nGreenidge Generation ($GREE) currently trades at around $30. Based on the way its recent merger was structured, this equates to roughly $3.45 pre-merger pricing. Pre-merger pricing was recently as high as $60. So, this is approximately a 94% decline. Just since the merger, $GREE has dropped 70%. Which brings me to my first point\u2026\n\n1. This dip is unjustified.\n\nIMO, a 94% decline is absurd and represents a great buying opportunity. We\u2019ve seen massive post-pump dips in the likes of $GME, $AMC, etc., and buying these dips would make you a wealthy autist indeed. (Not comparing $GREE to $GME, $AMC, etc., but providing a couple memorable examples of secondary pumps.)\n\nWhy the big dip, you ask? IMO, this is mostly due to a combination of scared bulls selling at a loss and institutional shorts terrorizing the stock (and today had macro factors at play obviously). Which brings me to my second point\u2026\n\n2. $GREE has overwhelming short interest (#1 most-shorted stock now).\n\nIf you've been following the stock, this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. It appears that there are some shorts with very deep pockets trying to hold this stock down. [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) ranks $GREE as the #1 most-shorted U.S. stock, with short interest at 68.36%. Frankly, if I were a betting man (I\u2019m not, I hate money), I would bet the percentage is even higher now - $GREE seems to have attracted a lot of new shorts in the past few days.\n\n3. $GREE is a cr\\*pto play. Cr\\*pto = \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\n\nLots of investors (retail and institutional) want exposure to cr\\*pto, but don\u2019t necessarily want to partake in the Wild West*\u2122* of cr\\*pto trading.\n\nIf investors want exposure to cr\\*pto, but instead want to partake in the Temperate and Hospitable East\u2122 of U.S. equity options trading*,* B\\*tcoin mining stocks like $GREE are a great alternative. In general, this space has performed quite well. In the past year, $MARA has gone up 1,693.12%. $RIOT has surged 839.59%. (In the same timeframe, $B\\*C increased only 300%). \n\n$GREE appears to be an especially interesting play for cr\\*pto mining. $GREE is significantly expanding its mining capabilities: [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/greenidge-generation-orders-10000-b\\*tcoin-miners-right-after-nasdaq-listing-2021-09-15](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/greenidge-generation-orders-10000-bitcoin-miners-right-after-nasdaq-listing-2021-09-15) Furthermore, from the article: \"The addition of 10,000 new miners is an important step in our commitment to expand our fully carbon-neutral capacity.\u201d Emphasis on \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d: as we\u2019ve seen, the environmental implications of B\\*tcoin mining have been catalysts for big moves in the cr\\*pto markets, so this makes $GREE an attractive play.\n\nFor additional evidence, see here: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/15/why-sphere-3d-stock-soared-26-today/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/15/why-sphere-3d-stock-soared-26-today/). When Sphere 3D announced news about its merger partner receiving equipment for carbon-neutral cr\\*pto mining, it popped 26%; yet $GREE saw the same news, on the same day (September 15), and dropped like a rock.\n\nAs always, do your own DD. I see lots of bulls on message boards that are pretty pessimistic, likely due to large paper losses that seem to grow each day (may also just be bashers pretending to be bulls). Personally, wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see $GREE rebound, likely above its merger price of $102, which would still represent an 81% discount from the peak. The shorts seem quite overextended. Good luck and fuck you",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR Too much cash, not enough collateral.** \n\n**Disclaimer:** I am by no means an expert on this topic, I like to snort green crayons but recently have been getting into some reds, and therefore barely know wtf I'm talking about. I'm not arrogant enough to claim I know everything to do with this and won't pretend to. Do your own DD, come up with your own conclusions, and remember the economy always goes up until it doesn't. \n\nOutside of a few select stock subreddits that I shall not name here, not many people seem to be talking about Reverse Repos and their subsequent effect on the market. Let's fix that, shall we? \n\n**What are Overnight Reverse Repos (ONRRP)?** \n\nI'm not gonna bore the shit out of y'all with a bunch of technical jargon so I shall simplify it (and note: this is a *simplification* and therefore some nuance and detail is not included, so go fuck yourself if you feel the need to be an ass about something I didn't include.) \n\nReverse Repo's are basically an agreement between the Federal Reserve (which is *not* the same thing as the Federal government) and large financial institutions (banks, hedge funds, Market Makers, your wife's boyfriend, etc.) that basically boils down to the Fed giving these institutions a \"specified security\" (usually U.S. Treasury Bonds) in exchange for cash. Now, since the government is stingy with their T-Bonds and Financial institutions might need their money back at a moment's notice, these transactions are essentially reversed at the end of the day. \n\nThe Reverse Repo Program (Or RRP for short) is \"officially\" used to tighten the money supply. (Note how I said officially, I'll come back to that later.)\n\nNow, there is another program that is sometimes mentioned, called the Repo Program, which is basically the opposite of the Reverse Repo. It is used to \"inflate\" the money supply in the economy. I will not go into much more detail on this program since I have used my remaining few brain cells to understand Reverse Repos and not much else.\n\n**Cool, but, like, why?** \n\nSo to understand why this program is essential to \"control the money supply\" (aka Decrease Inflation), you have to understand one thing about these big financial institutions. \n\n**Cash = Bad**\n\nSeems counterintuitive, right?  Well, sort of. Basically, cash in itself is bad for these businesses because of one simple reason; Inflation. Cash is considered a liability (a risk) on their balance sheets when it's just sitting there not doing anything. Does the phrase \"Use money to make money\" ring a bell? Regardless, Institutions need to have most of their money in investments in order to not lose money and any opportunities to make money. \n\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about what exactly these bad boys have been doing for the last year and a half.\n\n**What the Fed doin'?**\n\nHere I'm going to lay out the facts of the matter and leave the speculation as to the why's further down in the next section. So, I hope y'all like pictures. \n\nStarting in March of this year, The RRP had begun to be used after nearly a year of nothing. This began after margin requirements for banks were reinstated in March after the Fed had significantly lowered them to help the economy after the COVID crash. \n\n*Processing img qandbr09xqk71...*\n\nIt has only increased since. \n\nNot only that, the *way* it has increased is rather unusual compared to the past. Up until around late 2018, the RRP market was used rather frequently but usually only during Quater ends. \n\n*Processing img lusi5amazil71...*\n\nSo this sharp increase with seemingly no correlation with Quarter ends has led to a lot of people smelling the bullshit so to speak. \n\n**1 Trilly Baby**\n\nSince August 11th, the RRP has been above 1 Trillion and has, as of August 31st, hit a high of 1.189 Trillion. The previous high before this year was around $474 billion in 2015, right at the end of Quater 4. \n\n**Why is this happening?** \n\nThe simple answer is that we don't know. Don't pull out the pitchforks quite yet, there are a few theories as to why just no concrete reason (as of yet) since none of the big boys want to reveal their hands. \n\n**Stock Market Crash**\n\nThe Stock Market has been reaching ATH's for the last few weeks and with the eviction moratorium ending, and possibly up to 11 million families at risk of losing their homes, there's a chance a crash is coming which may make 2008 look like peanuts in comparison. (MBS's anyone?)  *\"The last time this many families were behind on their mortgages was during the Great Recession.\" - CFPB* \n\nIn regards to this coming crash, it's possible that big investors are unwilling to risk putting more money into the market when they can rely on the government with their T-bonds. (Which also helps their margin requirements, so win-win for them.) I admit, this is pretty speculative and needs further research than what I'm willing to do right now.\n\n**Collateral Crisis** \n\nThere is some evidence that there is an actual shortage of Treasury bills within the market (dropping yields from their highs earlier this year) which could explain the Big Boys reliance on the FED and RRP. Oh, and the money printer himself, JPOW, said this, *\u201cYou could say there is a shortage of safe short assets\u2026 there\u2019s a shortage of T-bills\u201d*. So, yeah that's mildly concerning. \n\n**Short Positions**\n\nAnother reason as to the apparent need for bonds could be risky bets made by financial institutions (\"meme\" stocks anyone?) and the inevitability of short positions bankrupting them. I seriously doubt any of the big boys have closed most of their short positions yet so this is my personal theory. \n\nThere is also a chance that it's a combination of all three, none, or something else entirely that has yet to rear its ugly head. \n\n**TL;DR PT 2**\n\nThe point is; Reverse Repo's are a signal that the market is in risky shape due to unavoidable monetary policy decisions by the Fed (brought on by COVID) and Financial Institutions taking incredibly risky bets with other peoples' money. Time will tell what exactly caused this spike in Reverse Repo's but I'd hedge your bets whichever way you can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** GME \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**References:**  Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements: Treasury Securities Sold by the Federal Reserve in the Temporary Open Market Operations \\[RRPONTSYD\\], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD, September 3, 2021.  \n\n Lewis Huxley.

That is a roughly 10,000% gain. I think you get the point.\n\n\"Value\" stocks like Ford and GM have gone up about 50% in the same time, a fraction of the growth stocks.

Now while one may have been focused on value and long term growth, their returns will have been essentially rooted to their peers who invested in growth. (ironic to call an unproductive asset like crypto \"growth\" but you get the point).

        "selftext": "Repost to fit subreddit criteria - sorry to keep in SPROTT, but their move affects everyone and it's hard to explain anything without including them.\n\nI'm sure it's not the first time you've come along Uranium, it appeared months ago and went with its success back to where it came from.\n\nEveryone involved in GME, AMC and anything else on here knows there are 3 things you need:\n\n1. A goal to act upon\n2. A support from media\n3. Big players outside of the general playingfield\n\nGME and AMC have received all 3 heavily. Due to the shorting beyond any reasonable means they were prime targets. This alone was enough for a decent price movement, but media enabled a global coverage of the topic which made so many more people aware of whats going on and flocking in. And lastly, many big names joined in, let it be for testing the waters or to join the fight. I'm sure you have a full list in your mind right now.\n\n**So what's with Uranium?**\n\nUranium is in a similar position and currently has the most aggressive movements in a company called **CCJ**, as well as ~~subreddit criteria~~. CCJ made it on the top 20 list of most bought options (in recent times) multiple times together with names of Tesla, Amazon etc.\n\nI'll explain the reason refered to as point 1, but I'll keep it short as it's the least impact of all. Without 2) and 3) not a lot would happen.\n\nSo in short, Uranium mines pretty much tuned down mining over the years due to demand but also because they are in a bad position. Most uranium buyers will only purchase short to mid term what they need instead of making contracts. Since these buyers exist in smaller amounts but with huge impact they can control what happens with the price, pretty much. So production went along with this and decreased to a minimum that can barely cover the needs and even slight interruptions that go on for a while would cause major issues.\n\nNow fast forward to the current date.\n\nThis is already 3) named Sprott.\n\nIf you don't know Sprott: \"Sprott is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets investing.\"\n\nWhat did they do? Well, don't take my word for it, let Bloomberg tell you what's going on:\n\n&gt;Sprott has amassed **over 24 million pounds** of uranium, sometimes buying more than 500,000 pounds in a single day, according to its website and social media account. For comparison, total spot volume for 2020 was 92.2 million pounds, according to uranium investor Yellow Cake Plc.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:\\~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc).\n\nThe expectation here is not a short squeeze as of now. The main expectation is an insane surge in price due to the tight demand-supply that was floating around Uranium and is now majorly interrupted. With how tight it is Sprott can pretty much control the price to an extend and that's why it's going crazy.\n\n**So what's with media support?**\n\n[**https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html**](https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html)\n\nWell, you are free to look for yourself, but it started and is as expected. The move of them is hyped up like crazy and this has by far not over at all. The initial price surge came from the news of them buying and announcing it, for a reference:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSPROTT announces their purchase program of Uranium\n\nThe media coverage is there and it's just starting off. If you search for Uranium and go 1 month, 1 wekk and 1 day back on the Google search you'll see an exponential increase in articles despite the way less time a single day has compared to an entire week.\n\n**But what's the future of Uranium?**\n\nI can't tell you what happens, if that was the case I'd be rich, sitting on a bought island and slurping cocktails 24/7. But this move caused by a company, not by a random action or idea - so it's their own interest to make the most out of it and considering what they just caused they are most certainly no idiots. The first impact is the announcement and what people understand will follow: A lack of supply. So why shouldn't mines just produce more? They sold a ton to SPROTT and could now satisfy the lack of product, right? Well, not really. If they do this, SPROTT will most likely decline or stop buying more, meaning their bumped up production is completely wasted for a one time pay off that might not even be good for them. But wait, it gets worse - for the Uranium buyers. A ton of nuclear power stations are opening. Nuclear Power is pretty much green energy with a bad side effect of radioactivity, but that's why it was pushed more and more. It's by far better for the environment than coal, which countries move away from - at least if they care about the environment.\n\nSo combined: Miners will most likely not increase production because they would shoot into their own foot (their ultimate goal is longterm well paying contracts), demand for Uranium will surge up in the next months and years and SPROTT doesn't stop buying current production. No matter what happens the price will keep surging since SPROTT can pretty much set the price they want, but in a likely case this might spiral to levels that we had back in 2011 with 70-80$ or heck even 140$ in 2007. Mind you a big move away from Nuclear Power Plants happened a while ago and with the new found hype for Uranium and the given issues this could become bigger than ever before.\n\n**So what do I do if I want to join?**\n\nAs mentioned you can either buy CCJ or the ~~subreddit criteria~~. All 3 are well performing among this surge. Don't get me wrong, all Uranium stocks have surged like crazy recently, but most options trading happens in CCJ while the ~~subreddit criteria~~ cover all the Uranium companies, making it a safer play though also covering the potential losers or low risers.\n\nNo financial advise of course, just sharing what my dummy brain was able to gather.",

        "selftext": "What\u2019s a SPAC-alackin, ya bunch of Mongols. Seriously, you guys have been barreling through the gates of high SPAC redemption this last month. IRNT? Did it. TMC? Got it. OPAD? Get it. So what else is on the menu\u2026? How about some easy peasy S. P. I. R. squeezy.\n\nThere\u2019s a million SPACs to squeeze, so\u2026 why this one? Let\u2019s start here, **LIQUIDITY**. The average daily volume over the last 5 days is only 2.3mm (115% float) for SPIR\u2026 whereas IRNT is 28.3mm (2,200% float), TMC 18.7mm (690% float), and OPAD 29.4mm (860% float). I mean\u2026 the volume was only 0.67mm on Friday before the pump. Um\u2026 say liquidity squeeze anyone? SPIR is so illiquid that DFV could squeeze this as a side hustle. Seriously, the capital required needs no hedgie (although we are accepting applications).\n\n**Company**\n\nSpire Global (SPIR) owns a ton of satellites that provide data and analytics for maritime, aviation, and weather purposes. That have several levels of subscriptions to provide. Their subscriptions are growing but\u2026 they lose money. For this play, we are all about the technicals so I won\u2019t spend time on fundamentals. Let\u2019s talk tech.\n\n**Liquidity Squeeze**\n\nAs noted above, this thing is so illiquid that you might wanna turn the bottle upside down. Plenty of other tickers have low float but only this one is a ghost town. \n\nThe total Class A shares outstanding is 134mm, most is locked up with insiders, institutions, and PIPE investors. The 23mm initial shares had 21mm redeemed (91%), leaving only 1.98mm shares for an effective initial float. For comparison, IRNT is 1.3mm, TMC 2.7mm, and OPAD 3.4mm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\(Note those 5.75mm converted from Class B are allocated to the sponsor and are subject to a specific lock up, leaving only 1.98mm for float\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xnxv8zeieko71.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a18ecc10fe9b0b09a7b39ff710f0eb68d3c17f)\n\nAccording to the 8-K, the company must file for PIPE registration (S-1) within 45 days of the closing of the merger. The PIPE will account for an additional 24.5MM so\u2026 let\u2019s not over stay our welcome. The merger closed 8/16/21 so the deadline to submit the S-1 is by (or before) 9/30/21. As of Friday (9/17), no S-1 has been filed.\n\nThe timeline for EFFECT filing is variable but is typically 1-2 weeks after the S-1 is filed. Therefore, the potential timeline for PIPE is anywhere from 9/27 to 10/15. Once the PIPE is fully registered, all bets are off. The other investors are subject to a lock up for at least 60 days from closing (8/16/21). So for at least the next week, we stay squeezy.\n\n**Short Squeeze**\n\nShorts have been priming this over the last several weeks. SI now amounts to an estimated 1.05mm shares or 53% SI of the current available float of 1.98mm. There are no shares to borrow from IBKR or Fidelity and I\u2019d be willing to bet that\u2019s the same for other brokerages.\n\nThe average estimated short cost basis is $10.48. As of close Friday (9/17), shorts are at an estimated 30% average loss and we\u2019re just getting started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ortex as of 9\\/17](https://preview.redd.it/dvm5d2qqeko71.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e899eef814f2f43ec0d915464228fff9aaae9c0)\n\nThe utilization has been at 100% and the cost of borrow is currently at 78% (ortex), 65% (IBKR), and 25% (Fidelity). the SI exceeds on loan by 78% which may indicate naked shorting. After all, if MMs have hedged the float but you degenerates keep buying, they gotta sell the fake shares.\n\n**Gamma Squeeze**\n\nThe option chain has been getting jacked over the last month. It\u2019s pretty insane due to the low float. Based on the OI reporting for 9/17 options on Friday, 0.8mm shares are tied to ITM contracts (net delta between ITM calls and puts). We\u2019re talking 40% of the float if exercised. \n\nIn total, the call OI for 9/17 expiration was 15,134 but\u2026 the remaining call OI for all other expirations is still 37,532 (48% which is tied to 10/15). The chain could get pumped further if call buying post-quad witching builds steam on Monday. After all, this is just getting started.\n\nOption surface plots across all expirations:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aygyw7vxeko71.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70279a245d30f7834ba762b0e779d5b8fd48b226\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/94dfd23zeko71.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4411df89ec529a94805ae26fb2424ebf31e6b7d\n\nCall OI is tearing upwards while we see with our microscope that the puts are pretty pathetic. MMs are delta hedged to the tits but what about that sexy gamma ramp? How is hedging going to change as price rockets (per OI; per BSM):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rqb54d61fko71.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ed00406b9b2d2e9bf824853cd1b95c267719d2\n\n(Note the x-axis for this graph is NOT strike, it is the actual stock price as it moves)\n\nThe price has been trading in the $7.5 - $12.5 range since deSPAC, requiring theoretical hedging anywhere from 0 - 150% of float. But\u2026 the hedging becomes insane above $12.5. On Friday, we saw the effect. The price broke up towards $15 before settling at close at $13.71. This price action required 150-200% float delta hedge\u2026 wow. If this break up above $20, the hedging blows above 250%. This is no joke and if the option chain continues to build, the gamma ramp will only get more psychotic.\n\n**Reading the tea leaves in the Charts**\n\nThere were bullish signals this last Thursday (9/16) and Friday (9/17). Thursday, we saw a bearish reversal candle. Based on other squeezes, this can be a signal of a bear trap before a breakout, just like we\u2019ve seen on GME, RKT, IRNT\u2026 so many others (CLOV, ATER, SPRT\u2026):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apkm9ul3fko71.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8744ac44df24f3f08e3faa80b9d49a1426627002\n\nRemember when everyone bailed on IRNT at like $25? Um\u2026 bear trap guys. Stage was set on Thursday for SPIR just like it was for IRNT. \n\nOn Friday, most SPACs were bleeding in sympathy with the fall of IRNT. However, midday, SPIR broke out from $10.70 up to $14.79. The price consolidated towards lower volume, curled up, then broke out again to finish the day at $13.71. Watching price action and the tape, there are signals a large player (or players) may by pushing. Since the ticker is so illiquid, it only takes a small volume of options activity to move. \n\n**Conclusion?**\n\nThis SPAC opportunity is unique due to liquidity issues. In addition, the short interest is maxed and the gamma ramp is stacked. With a little push (like Friday), this thing rockets.\n\nI am currently holding $10, $12.5, $20, and $25 10/15 calls\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* SPIR produces data/info with satellites.\n* Combination completed 8/16/21. \n* PIPE may go effective is 9/27 \u2013 10/15.\n* 1.98mm float w/ 1mm shorts (none left to borrow).\n* Option chain is loaded with approximately 37,500 call OI AFTER 9/17. Delta hedging is stupidly high (250%+ of float) above $20.\n* Chart includes a bullish signal of a bear trap via a fake bearish reversal candle (just like IRNT).\n* Potential liquidity, short, and/or gamma squeeze possible with little capital required.",

        "selftext": " IRNT is primed to blow, this is just the beginning. There are still lots of obligations to purchase shares out in the market. Let\u2019s run through the numbers. \n\n# The Story\n\nRight now, there is a ton of calls loaded up for IRNT. A call is a contract saying you will buy 100 shares at a certain price (strike price), the person who sold you the call, must sell you 100 shares at the strike price of the contract. There are approximately 90,000 call options that expire this friday. If every one of them is exercised, market makers will need to buy roughly 9 million shares to fulfil their obligations. Now of course not every call is going to be exercised. [According to the CBOE about 10% of all options are exercised](https://www.moneyshow.com/articles/optionsidea-43293/). Historically 60%-65% of options expire ITM. This results in about 15% of In The Money options getting exercised. If IRNT expires at 45$ on Friday then that\u2019ll be 8,427,600 shares that could be exercised. Since historically only 15% of calls are actually exercised, we take 15% of 8,427,600 and we get a dumbfounding 1,264,140 shares market makers will need to purchase to cover their calls! Currently there\u2019s 1,226,524 shares in the market (The available number of shares is known as the float). Market makers will have to procure more shares than what\u2019s available causing an Infinite Squeeze. Ideally, the more call options that are exercised and the more shares that are bought the more market makers will have to scramble to find shares. (So if you got options expiring this Friday, if you exercise them market makers will be forced to buy more shares). Today IRNT  blew past 45$ and peaked at 47$, if we buy and hold shares to go above 45$ by Friday, we can trigger an **infinite squeeze**. \n\n# The Short Interest\n\nYeah, I know. I know you are all sick and tired of hearing about sHoRtSqUeEzEs and all that garbage. I know everyone has seen way too fucking many of these posts, but hang on, because this is worth looking at. Right now, IRNT has a float of around 1.2 million shares. According to Ortex, the float was well over 5 million on the 13th. To get the % of the stocks shorted we get 5mil/1.2m for a casual 416% short interest. That\u2019s like what, triple the size of GameStop? when GME was being shorted to all hell before poppin 400$/share... Not to mention this short interest was reported on the 13th... before IRNT doubled in price... breaking 40$... Not to mention borrowing IRNT shares requires a 544% annual fee. Yeah\u2026 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o96i50cezxn71.png?width=1030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f243e675a59c33f6b2a3a1e6c10b1d8d5ac2b809\n\nIt appears that market makers, like Citadel, are borrowing shares to cover their calls in order to buy some time. Market makers can\u2019t buy off the open market since there\u2019s not enough shares to go around. Since they gave their borrowed shares to the people that exercised their calls, they are now hoping that IRNT will become cheaper. Unfortunately for them, every month they wait, they get charged 45.33%  (544% annual borrow fee / 12). If we can get IRNT above 45$ for tomorrow and then people hold up shares then this shit is going nuclear. There are just too many obligations to purchase shares out in the open market. This bomb is triple the size of GME and is primed to blow. Buy up shares, exercise options, i\u2019m loaded to the tits and ready to lactate and fully ejaculate. \n\n# Reversal\n\nHonestly the only way this can go tits up is if nobody gave a damn and everyone sold... which i guess very much could happen. I don't know why you would sell or stop caring for something this big. It's literally free money. Buy the stock, price goes up, hold it a bit, and then boom the stock will blow up and it'll blow you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Position\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[RH Yolo](https://preview.redd.it/4svqvl9e2yn71.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77c1396f342b393546f2e41e804c28b8c190979d)\n\n[TDA Yolo](https://preview.redd.it/dijup7jf2yn71.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1589aa9c644f9673d4cf3808342dd04f2c41dbf)",

        "selftext": " \n\nI've been following $IRNT since the post market jump when it went from $16 to $40 in AH. It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.\n\nThe setup is simple:\n\n1. The float is currently 1.3M shares due to SPAC redemptions &amp; lockups and will be at this number until after options expiry on Sep 17th.\n2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float\n3. Almost 200% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration. The movement we saw Friday is what we refer to as a \"pre-squeeze\" movement, there is likely far more to come.\n4. On Friday the $20 strike became ITM and instantly doubled the amount of the float that is claimed by the open interest.\n5. As of this morning ORTEX shows 4.3M shares shorted which amounts to 336% SI with a cost to borrow of 628% on average. I have doubts about the accuracy of this specific data because that would put the amount of the float claimed by institutional obligations nearing 600%, so I'll stick with saying that the last reliable data seemingly had SI at around 13% with the same elevated cost to borrow.\n\nIf $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of $ORGO &amp; $GME.\n\n$IRNT will very likely start running some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.\n\nBe warned, this play is incredible risky, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.",

This was expected (for a change, lol) and the shares are subject to lockup.*\n\nSince my last post, the percentage of float claimed by institutional obligations has risen from 273% to **479%** of float.\n\nToday we saw movement confirming an active gamma squeeze. Tomorrow, after a gap up, should be the first day of ***full squeeze*** movement to be compared with AMC on 06/02 and GME on 01/26 with a peak occurring on Friday. My PTs stay the same, the ones we haven't hit are now just more likely.\n\n~~Most Likely:~~ **~~$29~~** **Broken in intraday today 09/15**  \n~~Likely:~~ **~~$40~~** **Broken in post market 09/15**  \nIf everything goes right: **$135**  \nIf it matches other squeezes: **$210**  \nIf it goes to the moon: **$530**\n\nAs I said in the other posts, this situation is highly unusual and the low float on this stock enables it to run really fast and really hard when buy volume comes in.

        "selftext": " **TL;DR - stock with gamma squeeze potential and 157% short interest of float gets my dick hard. If OPAD reaches $16 market makers will need to hedge nearly 100% of float--and stock already reached $16 last Thursday. Market makers &amp; short sellers fucked.**\n\nNo doubt you've seen the IRNT posts about the unique situation arising from a low float and high call options. Well I've got news for you: I've been watching $OPAD like a hawk and it looks to be ramping up into the exact same situation as IRNT, and yet somehow you apes haven't realized this yet. If you're sad you missed out on IRNT and you think underwater mining is bullshit, then have I got the play for you. And you can actually seemingly get in early on this one too. I've been accumulating my position in OPAD since last Tuesday while watching the gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential increase every day. Read on for what I know, and buckle up cause this is a big one\u2026\n\n[OPAD is where IRNT was two weeks ago](https://preview.redd.it/0z9j53b2bon71.png?width=1659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f0f1c45bdd00818c3f61abc3640cd686efde050)\n\n*This is not financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Please keep in mind this is a high risk play and I am a random stranger on the internet - so make sure you do your own research! Don't blame me if you're a dumbass who YOLOs their whole account into 150% OTM 3 DTE calls and this doesn't materialize.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Background\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, some background on the company. Offerpad ($OPAD) is an iBuyer company with a current market cap of 2.636B.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wxq4xw4bon71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3beaf0d4855963388afc86057c8f74523ca2c797\n\nAn iBuyer is basically a company that uses their technology to make quick offers to home sellers, then re-sell those homes themselves for profit. Think Redfin, Zillow, Opendoor - those are OPAD's competitors.\n\nOfferpad de-SPACed just a few weeks ago and started trading as OPAD on September 2. For some reason investors fucking hated this thing, so prior to the ticker change the SPAC had a huge percent of redemptions just like IRNT - a whopping 92% redemption rate. As a result, there are now only 3,387,913 shares in the free float until PIPE unlocks (TBD at this point). And, just like IRNT, OPAD has fallen into this retarded loophole created by the genius SEC where it somehow has options even though the current float is technically too small for listing options.\n\n[Redemption info from OPAD's super 8K filing - a legal filing our SEC overlords make each SPAC file when it completes its merger and de-SPACs](https://preview.redd.it/1vjw8d48bon71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75752ce6d62b95ac0731442ef2fdb5da9c49580b)\n\nAs a result of the low float the stock has been extremely volatile since it began trading as OPAD on 9/2. It's seen 10-20% intraday swings pretty much every day since the ticker change. If you had just been trading those dips you'd actually probably be pretty fucking rich by now. OPAD even reached a high of $16 last Thursday. Just as it was starting to gamma squeeze into orbit, though, it was shorted to shit Thursday into Friday and eventually closed Friday down almost 40% from that $16 high. More on that shorting below - point is, this is super volatile and therefore also a high risk play. If that's too scary for you, though, then why the fuck are you on [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) in the first place? Go back to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and your 3 fund portfolio.\n\nAlso, if you're a smooth brain who obsesses over technical analysis - OPAD looks to have had a nearly perfect gap fill yesterday and has since started to take off into orbit (up 29% from that low end of day Tuesday).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qheyfjjdbon71.png?width=1669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b58b811614984f2013a2cdfb05a2259e7195d04\n\nClosed 9/3 at $8.63 and gapped up to open 9/7 at $10.09. On 9/3 retraced back down to $8.60 for all of one minute before bouncing back up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Fucked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, now to the really good stuff. I know as soon as you read \"gamma squeeze\" in the title your itty bitty micropeen got hard as a thumbtack, so let me give you some porn to jack off to.\n\nJust like IRNT, OPAD's options can put market makers in the position where they would need to buy over 100% of OPAD's current float in order to hedge their risk from writing options to retards like you all on WSB - and frankly, it's not that hard for OPAD to reach the point where this would happen. As further OTM call options become in the money, market makers will have to buy more and more of these shares to sell to you if you decide to exercise the contract. This is because of the options Greeks Delta and Gamma. Now normally I know that for you retards \"options Greeks\" usually means the options your wife's Greek boyfriend tells you to buy, but for this play Delta and Gamma are super important.\n\nSince I know you dgaf about options Greeks, let me try to dumb it down for you apes with a picture:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2pluvjwjbon71.png?width=1747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892bf16fa9e8a9325c69b8808fbad066e460a6bb\n\nBased on the options open interest as of yesterday, if OPAD reached $16 then market makers would need to hedge 98.21% of the current float. At Wednesday's close price, only 29.72% of the float would need to be hedged - still a huge amount, but clearly this thing has room to run. And on top of that, OPAD already managed to reach $16 last Thursday before it was swatted down by short sellers.\n\nRight now, as the price increases past $16 market makers would need to buy less and less additional stock to hedge since the stock price becomes further and further from the open options interest. If more people buy more OTM options, though, then the price could run even higher because market makers would need to buy even more stock even after the price runs (aka the situation IRNT is in right now). This is delta and gamma at play, and what can create a gamma squeeze. This covering would be incredibly difficult for market makers to do because of the low number of stock available in the float. OPAD already briefly reached $16 last Thursday and OPAD's options volume and open interest has been steadily increasing, so who knows what the fuck could happen over the next few days as we head into September options expiration.\n\nAlso, since you're a degenerate and have likely already started to buy options on this shit before even finishing my DD you may have noticed that OPAD's options open interest and volume is much lower than IRNT's. For one, this is probably because you apes haven't caught wind of OPAD until right now and haven't yet started buying large amounts of retardedly OTM calls. However, even with the lower overall open interest there is still a ton of potential.\n\nHere is OPAD's total open interest and volume since I started tracking it last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ahxfhvmbon71.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592b7835a2304db6ab812fdccfd9fb680b477ab8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puvnpdmobon71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e5d576a1ba05856cbe93449daa6b8c72cae3791\n\nHere's OPAD's OI and most recent volume for September expiration compared to IRNT, as of the end of the day Wednesday:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||OPAD|IRNT|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Puts - OI|3,326|25,276|\n|Calls - OI|19,369|58,031|\n|Put-Call Ratio - OI|0.17|0.44|\n|Puts - Volume|1,605|9,719|\n|Calls - Volume|16,205|41,787|\n|Put-Call Ratio - Volume|0.10|0.23|\n\nWhile the total number of calls (for all strikes and for September) is lower than IRNT, there are pretty much no puts open for OPAD whereas IRNT has almost half as many open puts as calls. Puts that market makers sell counteract the hedging that market makers need to do when price increases in order to cover the calls they sell, so for OPAD a much lower relative number of puts means that the open calls could still require market makers to hedge a large volume of shares even if there are less total calls than IRNT. To dumb it down for you apes - less put mean slightly less call still go big boom.\n\nAnd all of this isn't even accounting for you dumbass apes who love short-dated OTM options. Just like GME, stock buying is what can really get this going. But, more options open interest means that the gamma squeeze potential will only increase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Short Interest - Short Sellers Fucked\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y56rygbybon71.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb999d9ecbf55fe076aae8dbf20f5f8cc49a7977\n\n[I know short squeezes are like crack to you people, and I'm here to feed your addiction.](https://preview.redd.it/jck8gau0con71.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc05bf4a5ebb91d0c4ceba8067c56f69ad856da5)\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, ever since OPAD started to run last week it's been getting hammered by short sellers. To begin with, even taking out the gamma squeeze considerations with OPAD it's a retarded idea to short this stock right now. OPAD is a legitimate growth stock with many signs that it's significantly undervalued right now and could likely be a nice return even if you were to just buy and hold. For example, OPAD's 2021 projected revenue is $1.7-$1.85 billion. With their current market cap, they would only be trading at a 1.55 multiple; OPAD's peers are trading at multiple times higher than that. Even if all outstanding warrants are executed and after PIPE unlock, this stock will still be undervalued relative to its peers.\n\nThe crazy thing about the shorting is that according to Ortex, short sellers have now managed to accumulate a total short interest of 5.33 million - which is **157% of the current float**. Short interest **increased 36% yesterday**, cost to borrow reached as high as **220.08%**, and **utilization is at 99.98%** (aka there are pretty much no shares left to short).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/btsivxm2con71.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684fd041c0a8b15af0761fed6ed835d88b9a1634\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fvtcdr3con71.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1948a30365647cadf2459096e789bbe99c1c211\n\nShort sellers would already need to purchase 1.5x the current float to fully cover their positions. However - remember what I said earlier about the market makers needing to buy stocks to cover the calls they're writing to you retards? Because the market makers are doing that, there would be even less shares for short sellers to cover with. This is how you get to infinity squeeze potential - there just wouldn't be nearly enough shares available for everyone to buy what they need to cover. This gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential is also exactly what happened with GME back in January. It's almost like these dumbass short sellers haven't learned a damn thing.\n\nIt also seems that these short sellers caught on to this risk and really don't want this thing to blast off. And I take offense to that - I want my tendies. These huge drops in price were rally killers. If you check the open interest from Ortex above you'll see the huge increase in short interest after last Thursday.\n\n[Shorts fucking with OPAD when it started to take off last Thursday](https://preview.redd.it/mr2cfuu4con71.png?width=1666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=359769d5f4676a797ecff357c00ad0f47fe90927)\n\n[Shorts fucking with OPAD again when it started to take off Wednesday](https://preview.redd.it/dpsq83p5con71.png?width=1670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f80e9a93511d65bb9c10f457249823e70a8b07)\n\nWhat's great is that even though this has been significantly beaten down by short sellers, OPAD has come right back after each dip you see above. This thing just cannot be beaten.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eht6wkq7con71.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=570e9c1bd82e51863c34106b5666d0e8fa91e483\n\nMore importantly, though, is that since these short sellers seem to just keep doubling down each time this thing starts to blast off they will be extra mega-fucked once it actually does achieve liftoff. Each time they double down on their shorting they are just adding more fuel to the fire. More than that, if the folks shorting OPAD are the same ones shorting other low float stocks like IRNT, and OPAD pops alongside those other stocks - we very well could see short sellers getting margin called from multiple positions turning extremely against them all at once just like we saw back in January/February with GME, AMC, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4s8y6k8con71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=572dfc1c1e7a6baf03e1fe610864b755ce7b8547\n\nSo, there you have it--yet another gamma squeeze/short squeeze stock for you to go apeshit over. Good luck, this one should be lit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/up8fm599con71.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92991b84268635c27e5f743f9584bb74c1c6d7d7\n\nOh, also - positions below. I didn't sell last Thursday during the run, instead I've been steadily buying more. This baby still has lots of room to run and has yet to truly pop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpjcqs3acon71.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8f2449319bc5ee538da2015162549ea25434b2c",

Not just general intelligence but incompetence in individual fields. \n\nIf you haven't beaten the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you got a bit unlucky. If you've managed to beat the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you're an investing god. That ego can make you broke, and now is the time for a humility check. \n\nYou're in this subreddit. If you're reading this, do you think you're better than the top investors out there- Burry, Dalio, Wood, Buffet? Well, maybe you are, but statistically, you're probably not. \n\nSo, what do the top investors say lately? Here's my interpretation:\n\nBurry: We're in the biggest speculative bubble of all time in all things.   \nAssets under management (AUM): $635 million\n\nDalio: US Bonds are crap, US equities are frothy, tech is bubble-ish. Get into emerging markets. China isn't so bad.   \nAUM: $140 billion\n\nBuffet: I'll reduce my positions and wait for a better entry.  \nAUM: $632 billion\n\nWood: Innovation will lead to enormous GDP and productivity growth over the next 5-10 years.   \nAUM: $53 billion\n\n=============================================\n\nIf you've been following financial news this year you probably know that Burry started shorting TSLA back in Dec 2020 and has been crying wolf that we're in a bubble since this spring. Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. \n\n Speculation is at an all-time high. Look at this chart of subscriber count for WSB:\n\n[I'm guessing most of these new subscribers aren't YOLOing on OTM SPY puts every week.](https://preview.redd.it/50kiiie6zbn71.png?width=3010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c4c7817c548515eae1823cc2f0e986565522ea9)\n\nTake a look at this chart of TSLA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhh5i2tfzbn71.png?width=2492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c354ae8100a048cf81176d619ddaaa5f51b4dda\n\nAnd compare it to the standard asset bubble chart here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hngourvbycn71.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9175668887dbb1f5639fd54ce395c38865b0a879\n\nNow with fundamentals way off, TA lining up, and lots of possible macroeconomic issues in the near future, this looks to me like a great setup for a short. Now of course, nothing is certain in the markets. BUT, if the bubble is about to pop, this could be the trading opportunity of a lifetime. That's why I'm going short. \n\n\"Burry is a value-shill permabear\"\n\nBurry was long on a bunch of equities at the bottom of the pandemic last year, he bought GME at $5.

That is, even if they knew they positions were overvalued, they aren't always able to get out of before causing panic in the underlying. For this reason, you always have to take what they say with a grain of salt. Wood, who is a brilliant investor, would obviously not say that TSLA is overvalued, same that Dalio will not say that BABA is a risky stock to hold. It's a perfect case of \"do as I say, not as I do.\" So instead of listening to what they say, which is always going to be biased, try looking at what they do. \n\nAnd lately, Wood has been selling TSLA. When the **bulls start selling**, it might be a good time to get out. \n\nTSLA JAN 2022 670 PUT\n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own DD.",

        "selftext": "I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t seen any explanations on WSB (at least in recent months) about how the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust works, and how it helps to fuel the epic short squeeze going on in Uranium right now.\n\nThe physical trusts offered by Sprott are closed-end funds, meaning that when investors sell the fund, Sprott does not have to go out and also sell Uranium to fund outflows.\n\nIn other words, once uranium hits the Sprott vaults, it might as well be declared retired forever. \n\nThey are structurally diamond handed, which is important for a short squeeze to continue.\n\nSo how does more metal enter the fund?\n\nSprott has filed an \u2018at the money\u2019 share offering where they can issue new shares of the fund any time it trades at a premium to the fund\u2019s net asset value.\n\nEssentially whenever investors get excited and bid up the price of the ETF such that that shares are being bought for more than their underlying value, Sprott will issue new shares, sell them into the market (which helps bring down the premium), and then use this cash to buy more uranium for the fund.\n\nIn the span of a month investors already added enough uranium to the fund to exhaust Sprott\u2019s $300 million offering.\n\nLast week they filed a new offering to increase it from a $300 million program, to a $1,300 million ($1.3 billion) program.\n\nWhile this filing process has been ongoing the past few days, Sprott has not been issuing new shares. So inflows into the fund are driving up the premium to NAV.\n\nThe premium now sits at a record high 28.5%.\n\nFor perspective, during the Uranium surge that took price from the $20s to the $40s over the past month, the typical premium for the fund was in the mid single digit %s.\n\nSo 28.5% is absolutely remarkable. This is a dam about to break and drown everyone who lives on the other side. Once Sprott is able to issue shares once again, it will now be able to buy more uranium out of the market than anyone thought possible. $180-$200 is entirely possible here as a blow off top (currently at $45 a pound).\n\nAnd this is a minuscule market, so sprott\u2019s buying directly drives the price up. And because market participants know the price of uranium is effectively guaranteed to rise because of this guaranteed source of pent up demand, they are are willing to pay for the premium in the uranium fund to get a piece of the action. \n\nThis of course only drives the premium of the fund up further, allowing Sprott to issue even more shares, buy even more uranium, sending the uranium price up further, exciting more investors who will buy the fund, and the cycle repeats \n\nThis is effectively a short squeeze where the buying is being telegraphed ahead of time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the short squeeze has begun, but buying here is the equivalent of buying GME a when it was in the $50-$100 range on the initial surge.\n\nSo what tickers can be offered up here? \n\nNot many, because the uranium space is tiny and WSB has a $1.5 billion market cap minimum.\n\nOptions? You can, but premiums are absurd now that the squeeze has already begun.\n\n$CCJ is one ticker you\u2019ve likely heard of, and it\u2019s the only one with mkt cap large enough to mention directly.  \n\nSprott Uranium Trust is the vehicle I\u2019ve written about here where you can buy uranium directly (rather than miners), and directly contribute to the squeeze, but I also can\u2019t post the ticker yet due to mkt cap concerns. It\u2019s also only available in Canadian and otc markets, but Sprott is trying to get it listed on the NYSE as well for the future. You can buy it via Fidelity and a few other brokers right now though. \n\nNorthshore uranium etf has lots of miners in it but a mkt cap of $350m so no ticker\n\nWant to sell shovels rather than set out on a mining adventure yourself? Sprott the company owns the uranium trust driving this whole thing and collects fees from it. Benefiting from the inflows into the fund as well as the underlying price appreciation of uranium.  They also have direct exposure to several uranium miners they\u2019ve invested in. They also aren\u2019t big enough yet at $1 billion to post the ticker.\n\nThis uranium short squeeze, powered by the Sprott physical trust is everything the silver squeeze should and could have been back in the first quarter.  If silver squeezers had bought the Sprott physical fund, PSLV, rather than ishares SLV, silver would be far higher now. Let this be an example of what\u2019s possible in commodities when physical demand overwhelms a relatively limited supply of available metal!",

These small 20-5 cent fighhts each day dont mean shit to me.\n\nAnother example , tesla oh shit its been inthe 600-700 range for a while , idc cause im holding for a few years.\n\nInvesting is buying into a company that you believe due to dd is going to be worth more over the long run and you  **dont give 2 fucks about the daily /weekly price battles.** \n\ntrading on the other hand is = whats the catalyst? Trading is in my opinion figuring out what the catalyst us and using that catalyst ti your advantage.\n\nHere let me put it like this spce had a catalyst which was that launch thing(space mission) . Tradrers bought a position before the launch and after the launch they sold off. Really it was right b4 the launch actually happened. But you see what i mean. \n\nShit nvidia had a stock split announcement , thats a catalyst for traders to buy lots of shares of it and sell off on the split date.  Again trading on a catalyst .\n\nShit the catalyst could be a TA for instance netflix was trading in a 500-600 channel. When netflix dropped close to its support traders bought into it as it bounced off the 500 support and ran back to the 600 resistance ... yall see?\n\n**Trading is finding a catalyst for a stock and then figuring out how it will effect the stock price in the short term and using it to your advantage.**\n\nTHis isnt financial advice.

        "selftext": "This post is going to be about why IRNT presents one of the greatest squeeze opportunities that WSB and retail investors have ever seen. Because the company has only been trading for 2 weeks, it's hard to analyze technicals other than volume. Thankfully, the short interest and float are the main reasons why this stock presents such a great opportunity, so those will be analyzed below.\n\n**\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier. You should talk to a financial professional before making any investment decisions and should do your own research\\***\n\n**Short Interest Stats and Analysis**\n\nTo put it simply, the short interest on IRNT is absolutely insane. Combine that with the fact that it's a newly trading company (and susceptible to more volatility) and has a VERY low float, and you have a recipe for an absolute slam dunk.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at Fintel and iBorrow desk. iBorrowdesk has consistently shown the borrow fee to be over 500% and the available shares to be far below 10,000. Similarly, fintel has consistently showed less than 1,000 shares available to borrow. Though some people don't trust these sites, the similarities in the data help to add credibility\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qubmtqnjxjn71.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e966aee1e3deb1b3f19bb4edfebeb4090e3bb1a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yuuj6skkxjn71.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97cbe756d2845006ddb0c35e624032935587c4a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0vhzl9lxjn71.png?width=986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=082680490a232aa61f456c8a4492050d51e5baef\n\nI'd also like to turn your attention to [this post by another WSB user](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/). This post analyzes how the extremely low float of this stock due to it being a new stock and the insane option OI presents the opportunity for a legitimate gamma squeeze - not some fake hype run up - a legitimate gamma squeeze similar to GME's first run up.\n\nIf you look at websites like Baron's they'll tell you that the SI as a % of the float is only 1.79% (about 700,000 shares). This is correct but doesn't tell the whole story. Because of redemptions and lockups, the actual float is 1.3m shares, which makes the real short interest on tradable shares about 56%. Interestingly, [Ihor's tweet](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19) shows that the borrow fee is asininely high, which again shows the difficulty of borrowing of this stock and thus the easy possibility of a short squeeze. 56% short interest is an amazing number in and of itself, but that's not the whole story. The thing about this stock that really gets me going is the options activity. The OI on options of this stock is absolutely bananas right now. Remember when I said that there are about 1.3M tradable shares due to it being a new stock post-merger? Well, at a $20 price, almost double that amount is held in ITM calls alone. THAT is why the stock has serious gamma squeeze potential. Remember, both the GME and VW squeezes happened because ITM options OI outnumbered the float of companies that were already heavily shorted - this is the power of a gamma squeeze. Most meme stocks that have been \"squeezing\" recently have been small short squeezes due to retail traders and HFs taking advantage of social sentiment. The reason that we haven't seen a violent squeeze recently is because there hasn't been a stock with options activity like this - until IRNT.\n\nAdditionally, you probably saw that the stock went up to almost $40 last week out of nowhere. Again, this is the power of a low float stock with high ITM call OI. If this stock starts picking up, the low float and call OI could propel it to meme stock legend status.\n\nFurthermore, data from ortex has also consistently shown a SI of over 300% and a cost to borrow over 500%, which is consistent with the sources listed above. Yes, the SI is definitely a plus, but again, the real power here is the gamma squeeze potential.\n\n(The above four paragraph's were heavily borrowed from the originally linked user, so please check out his post).\n\nMany people will probably not believe some of these shorting numbers and will consider them unreliable because of how new the stock is. That's understandable. However, if you're in that camp, let me present to you this: the NYSE's regulationSHO FTD list. Per SEC regulations, stocks that reach over a certain amount of FTDs are placed on regulation SHO's threshold list. This is a very small list and identifies stocks that are grossly over-shorted (FTDs being the evidence of that). GME was on this list for a very long time before it squeezed. So if you don't believe the websites's SI numbers, then you at least have to believe the NYSE's numbers about FTDs. When a stock has too many FTDs, it means that it is extremely hard to locate shares and repay borrowers, which is a sign of over-shorting. Here is the NYSE list:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5q0vbtmxjn71.png?width=2710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e76c960abd9f88936b898b3dbebbf5d82519a9cb\n\nNotice the second to last one? DING DING DING. Though being on the threshold list signifies overshorting, there is yet another thing that we can take from this - forced covering. IRNT has been on that list since 9/2. Per regulationSHO, after 6 TRADING days on the list (9/10), stricter location requirements for shorting are put in place. Take a look at the giant green uptick that we saw on 9/10. 13 TRADING days on the list and forced coverings start taking place where a market-maker is subject to fines and loses his or her market making abilities if this regulation is violated. 13 TRADING days after 9/2 is 9/21. Remember all of those call options I talked about above, well they will be exercised on Friday 9/17. So, let's review what we have: an extremely high reported short interest (you can believe it's 600%, 300%, 56%, whatever), an extremely low an restricted float, ITM options expiring on Friday that outnumber the total float, the stock being on the threshold list indicating over-shorting, forced coverings taking place right around when those options would have to be delivered. Again, this is exactly what we saw with GME. It's important to note however, that this is also an issue of timing - the stock is likely to have a gamma squeeze sometime late this week and through next week. After that, there's a good chance that covering could lead to the stock being taken off of the threshold list.\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nThink that IRNT is just a squeezable meme stock with no long term potential as an investment? Wrong. The stock is not like most meme stocks - it actually is a good underlying business. According to an article by a website not allowed on here (just copy and past the quote in google to find it), \"With the company\u2019s international expansion, M&amp;A initiatives, and cloud acceleration, under my most optimistic case scenario, the company is worth $55 per share. If IronNet continues to sign agreements with nation states and companies like CrowdStrike did, I believe that the upside potential is significant.\" The article discusses how the company's AI initiatives, cyber security focus, and cloud acceleration, all of which are some of the most important and up and coming technology sectors, poise it to go up in value significantly. Additionally, the company also just reported earnings. Though the earnings were lower than expected, take a look at the after hours activity - the shorts have no juice left.\n\n**Conclusion/TL;DR**\n\nSo there you have it. in my opinion, IRNT is an EXTREMELY good stock fundamentally so I will be holding it long term. HOWEVER, the stock also presents a rare gamma squeeze - short squeeze opportunity that retail hasn't seen since GME. The stock has an extremely high reported short interest, an extremely small float, open interest on ITM call options that outnumbers the current float, is on the regulationSHO threshold list indicating that it has extremely high short interest and possible naked shorting, has been on that list for a significant amount of time, and the ITM options that outnumber the float are expiring right around when shorts would be forced to cover their FTDs. In other words, an absolute grand slam.\n\n**\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier.

Investing in plays like this is extremely risky and you should do your own research or consult with a financial advisor prior to making financial decisions\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello everyone, yesterday I made a post about why I think IRNT is one of the best opportunities retail has ever seen. Generally, this post got very good reactions but there were definitely some people who said I was retarded and that the play was dead. Though I definitely am retarded, the play is clearly not dead. Now that I have your attention about the potential of IRNT and you've seen SOME of it's potential, I'd like to discuss the stock more.  \n\nFirst, I wanted to link the recent DDs of IRNT that have been on this sub: \n\n[My recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/poe2gb/irnt_is_the_one_of_the_greatest_opportunities/)\n\n[The post I referenced in my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/)\n\n[An update to the above post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pobzn6/update_irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_273_of_float/)\n\nThere are probably others as well but these are the ones that I based my DD off of\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary of the IRNT play**\n\nIRNT recently started trading. Websites are reporting a short interests of 56% 233% and all the way up to 550%. Websites like iBorrowdesk and Fintel are consistently reporting less than 1000 borrowable shares. Because of redemptions and lockups, the float is extremely limited to about 1.3m shares. Unlike most stocks in this position, the stock has options that would only be available to a stock with 10x larger float. Additionally, the amount of options that are ITM and are expiring ITM on Friday outnumbers the total float. In most stocks on this sub that have squeezed, short interest has been the only factor. This stock, however, is similar to AMC and GME in that it has a disgustingly high short interest AND the ITM options expiring on Friday out number the float. That is why this stock has the highest squeeze potential since GME and AMC. Additionally, the stock is on NYSE threshold list, which indicates that it has too many FTDs, which is further evidence for this play. Very few stocks make it on this list and it is a sign of over-shorting. The stock has been on that list since 9/2 and, per regulationSHO, forced deliveries of FTDs will begin next week. The aligning of forced delivery of FTDs, option delivery, and an insanely low float presents a unique opportunity. There has been some confusion as to whether this play ends on Friday or if it goes into next week. The answer is unequivocally that the play goes into next week - that will be explained below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Next week is the real play**\n\nThere has been great confusion about this play regarding the lockup period. I have had several people message me and comment saying that the lockup period ends on Friday, which would allow more shares to come into the market and would end the play. This confusion comes from how people have interpreted point 1. of u/stonkgodcapital first post:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6v7id3mcrpn71.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278bdafec942c361184281add312aa739542f170\n\nI have talked to the user to clarify this and have done my own research to ensure this is accurate. When I talked to him, he confirmed that he was saying the redemptions and lockups will keep the float at 1.3 million AFTER options expire Friday. He was not saying the lockup ends on Sept 17. He was saying that the float will remain small WELL AFTER options expire this week, so when options must be delivered next week and the float is still small, a squeeze could happen because the shares that must be delivered outnumber the float. I also did further digging. I could not find a single source that said ANYTHING about more shares being added to the float anytime soon, lockups ending soon, etc. I looked at [IRNT's form 8-k](https://docoh.com/filing/1777946/0001193125-21-263381/IRNT-8K) and found that the lockup ends 180 days after August 26, 2021. This makes sense because that is a typical length for SPAC lockup periods. So, in case you did not understand: THE LOCKUP DOES NOT END FRIDAY AND THE FLOAT WILL REMAIN MINISCULE NEXT WEEK WHICH WILL ALLOW A SQUEEZE TO HAPPEN.\n\nTherefore, the real play here is next week because: the float will still be small, shares will have to be delivered next week and the amount will outnumber the float because of the current OI on options expiring Friday, and forced delivery of FTDs will also occur next week due to the stock being on the threshold list since 9/2. HOWEVER, because of the low float and high Reddit interest, I do expect this stock to continue trending up for the rest of the week - so we very well could see extremely high prices come friday but I still believe that next week is when we see the peak.\n\nWhat happened last week was after IRNT initially popped, then people lost interest, so it fell back down. Today, the stock got more interest and absolutely took off - that's the power of a low float stock. However, this stock presents a special opportunity because it has a low float AND the number of ITM options that could be exercised next week outnumbers the current float of the stock - that's why this is one of the best opportunities WSB has ever seen. If this stock continues to gain traction, there is nothing that can stop it because of its low float. \n\n**Earnings**\n\nIRNT also reported earnings yesterday (it's called a surprise earnings and is because it's newly trading). The earnings report showed a wider than expected loss. An earnings report of that kind should make the stock go down or, at the very least, be flat for the day. Being up 20%+ makes no sense, so the only explanation is that the squeeze theory for this stock is correct. Please note that this is a side bar and has basically no bearing on the play - I just included it because earnings happened yesterday. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIRNT is the first play since GME and AMC to have a disturbingly high short interest, extremely low float, and ITM options expiring in the near term that outnumber the float. This stock has both short squeeze and gamma squeeze potential. It is important to note that the lockup DOES NOT end on Friday, it ends 180 days from August 26. Because the lockup does not end soon (keeping the float small), ITM options will have to be delivered next week, and regulationSHO will require delivery next week, this play GETS BIG next week - we will probably see more gains this week, but next week is when it gets real. \n\nI am still in on the play and have no touched my position since yesterday. See my previous post for a screenshot of my position. I plan to hold all of my shares until well into next week. Depending on price action, I may sell my options for deep OTM calls at an earlier horizon to take advantage of next week's price jump. \n\n**\\*\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

But I'm having trouble finding logical answers to basic questions regarding the theoretical squeeze. It's a cult over in superstonk and GME subs, can't get straight answers. \n\nThe squeeze theory at it's core hinges on hedge funds needing to cover a massive short that includes millions of synthetic Gamestock shares. When it eventually must reconcile, the share price will moon to 5K, 50K, 500K etc. Per share. Some even believe a single share could reach millions of dollars.

The market makers go under, and there's a domino effect. The US economy tanks. Is that the idea? Or the gov steps in for a bailout, which at this scale also would be a catastrophic event.

        "selftext": "Hello retards,\n\nI've been watching $GME like a hawk all week and the correlation between volume and price for the past week is incredible and to me seems very, very bullish. Check it out:\n\nAugust 26th at open: Spikes on high volume (889k shares in first hour, goes up $10). It waffles for a bit  as volume declines and hits its daily peak at $217 on 851k shares. Volume drops like a rock for the rest of the day and it sinks back down to $203.80 at close.\n\nAugust 27th: Jumps from $207 to $213 at open, volume goes down then back up over the course of the day and the price kinda waffles. This one doesn't follow the trend so well. The next day does, however\n\nAugust 30th: Jumps from $206 to $215 in the first hour on high volume (547k shares). Volume declines for the rest of the day and it drops again\n\nAugust 31st: Jumps about $6 in the first 2 hours on high volume (315k first hour, 729k second).\n\nSept 1st (Today): Jumps to hit its weekly peak of $231 at open on its **highest one-hour volume all week**, with 1.09M shares traded in the first hour. It then spends the rest of the day tanking on decreasing volume.\n\nIs it just me or does this seem incredibly bullish? It seems if we had a sustained high volume event we could see this stock rocket. Fortunately we probably do, as Sept 6-8th are the 3 days before earnings. Once this thing hits WSB and news outlets consistently we could easily be riding the rocket. Also because you're all brain damaged, this isn't financial advice.\n\n[crayon lines &amp; arrows for our special readers](https://preview.redd.it/9y9o5d5sgzk71.png?width=1913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7912e178518b335e0a07490fce23d79aaf7a63cf)\n\nAs a side note: comparing this to $AMC is pretty funny. It literally tanks on some of its recent volume spikes. Biggest P&amp;D of this week and stands no chance to keep going up.\n\nPositions: 3x $GME 10/15 690c @ 2.90(?) cost basis, probably buying one last one tomorrow.",

        "selftext": "Everything here is not financial advice. I just want to know if someone can do it better.\n\n**Prediction:**\n\nPersonally, I'm banking on a quick crash of 30%-40% of the overall market followed by a lengthy recovery time.\n\nWith the public consciousness being aware of the rapid inflation, the Great Resignation, the ending of the eviction moratorium, rising tensions within and out of the country, scrambled supply lines accompanied with mass shortages, and blah-blah-blah, I think a lot of investors have their fingers hovering over the sell button. This, along with the addition of short sellers ready to dogpile on the beginning of a downward trend, should result in a sharp decline in several securities' prices. However, unlike the Covid-19 crash, I do not believe we'll experience a quick bull rally after the market bottoms out.\n\nThe flash crash of 2020 was driven by the fear of an unknown virus and the suspicion of an overdue recession, but once heavy government intervention was in place, investors had their confidence restored. This time around, the U.S. is facing a likely default on it's debt and dealing with almost irreparable internal economic problems, and the general confidence in our institutions has greatly withered since then. I think America's government is very limited with how it can intervene and I have trouble seeing the market whales and many retail traders easily jumping right back in after any announcement has been made; leading to a prolonged stagnation.\n\nNow, I am certainly not a professional in market predictions or knowing what the hell the powers that be can do alter markets. I'm just someone who likes trading and has been keeping up with the news. You should take this prediction with a FISTFUL of salt.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nSadly, my broker restricts much of what I can do (no naked options, no covered puts, no margin account for options, etc.), which restricts how much I can grow my account. Nevertheless, I worked a way around these rules and plan for a FAT gain.\n\nWith that said, I want to combine my money with borrowed cash from friends/family (people who are outside the market) and a personal loan, plus whatever my brokerage will give me in my margin account. Estimated leverage should be roughly x3.5. After gathering the capital, I will short the ever-loving shit out of SPXL (a 3x leverage ETF of the SP500) and use the new founded cash along with some of the account's original capital to buy ATM puts. Next, using a majority of the remaining capital, I'll buy shares of SPXS (a 3x leverage inverse ETF of the SP500) and sell deep OTM calls because of the increased volatility due to panic selling. What's left of the account will be spent on ATM calls of SPXS.\n\nI chose SPXL and SPXS for the fact they follow the very stable and predictable SP500, but with more bang for their buck. I know WSB isn't known for it's safer gambles, but with the increased risk of using so much borrowed money and a falling market, I needed something to sound somewhat safe and reasonable to place the bet.\n\nIf this portion of the plan fails, all I have to simply do is consolidate all my debt and then become Wendy's personal bitch boy for the better portion of my life, reflecting on where I went wrong as I shovel grease into the mouths of meatbags. If this portion of the plan succeeds, then after paying back the principle and one to two month's worth of interest (how long I think the decline will last), I should obtain a return of at least x10.\n\n***NOTE:*** *i failed math class. number may vary.*\n\nNext up is the stagnation period of the crash. I will be taking some of the gains out of the brokerage account lock in my win. The rest will be scaled into discounted stocks (likely blue chips with decent dividend yields and leveraged ETFs). On top of scaling in, selling iron condors would also be considered. If it turns out that the economy will undergo another v-shaped recovery like last time, I'll kiss goodbye to most of my winnings, but still make it out with a profit.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nAnyone got a better alternative for taking advantage of the market crash without going full retard and yoloing your mortgage in deep OTM Tesla calls expiring in six minutes? Am I overlooking an opportunity or flaw in my plan? Did you even bother reading all of the post? Is everyone still holding onto GME?\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nI'm certainly not a doomer (or god forbid, a gay bear), but I do recognize crashes do happen and I just want to utilize extreme leverage to make a hefty gain after it's all said and done. But I do struggle to make five bucks on a ten thousand dollar account, so what the fuck do I know.",

        "selftext": "The world is producing roughly 125 million pounds from primary mining, 25 million pounds from secondary sources and consuming roughly 180 million pounds, for an overall deficit of 30 million pounds a year. This deficit will only increase in future years, as additional reactors come online. If you want to quibble with my numbers, quibble away. I know I\u2019m off by a few million pounds, but so is everyone else. No one really knows the true numbers\u2014which is what makes commodity markets so fascinating in the first place. All that matters is that there is a deficit, it\u2019s a big percentage of total production, new mines are not coming online at current prices and existing mines have had years of under-investment\u2014hence production should continue to trail off without new investment.\n\nHow large are the above-ground stockpiles? No one knows. All we know is that they\u2019re drawing down rapidly and outside of government entities, most of the stockpiles are spoken for by utilities, which are using their uranium to fabricate finished products for their reactors. However, a new class of investors has entered the market and they\u2019ve completely upended the equilibrium.\n\nRemember, GBTC?? I remember it quite fondly. What if I told you there\u2019s another entity doing the same thing in uranium, but it is cornering the free float at a rate that makes the boys at GBTC look like amateurs? What if the free float is organically shrinking due to the supply deficit? What will happen as institutional investors jam themselves into a far smaller market? Fukit, who cares? Someone intends to conduct this science experiment; consequences be damned. Importantly, this entity is using an At The Market offering (ATM). Hence, it immediately produces free trading shares; increasing trading volume far more rapidly than GBTC with its 6-month hold\u2014making acquisition by institutional investors possible and driving adoption. Basically, it\u2019s GBTC 2.0\u2014issue shares to buy product. Every day. Relentlessly. Except, against a smaller and shrinking asset class.\n\nUranium is different\u2014almost everyone who owns uranium today, owns it because they intend to consume it in their reactors\u2014these owners are all incremental buyers going forward. In a market with a deficit, they\u2019re all implicitly short uranium. With an entity buying up the free float, they\u2019re going to get squeezed. We all know how squeezes work, but I don\u2019t know of any similar scenario where the squeeze was as aggressive or blatant. The utilities are blissfully unaware, they\u2019re eventually going to panic and pay any price for uranium as a reactor that runs out of uranium is just an expensive paperweight.\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust commonly known as SPUT (SRUUF\u2013 Canada), is the entity that has upended the uranium market. **Since launching its ATM 13 days ago, it has acquired 2.7 million pounds of uranium**. This is an average daily rate in excess of 200,000 pounds or roughly a third of global production on an annual basis**. If GBTC is the roadmap to follow, as the price of uranium begins to appreciate, the inflows into the trust should accelerate. Interestingly, there are plenty of other entities also purchasing physical uranium, uranium that utilities were counting on for their future needs. The squeeze is on.**\n\nAs expected, the utilities are blissfully unaware. Surprised?? I\u2019m not. Utilities are quasi-governmental agencies, managed by the types of fukwits who\u2019d work at your local DMV, except they enjoy stock options. The fact that they\u2019ve ignored the coming squeeze shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Inevitably, they\u2019ll demand rate increases to buy back this uranium\u2013it\u2019s not their money anyway. This is your bid at some point in the future.\n\nCommodities are determined by supply and demand. Uranium is a small market at roughly $6.3 billion in annual consumption (180 million pounds at $35/lb). SPUT has raised approximately $85 million in the 13 days since the ATM went live. It\u2019s hoovering up supply and is already struggling to procure pounds, as shown by their increasing cash balance\u2014cash that they\u2019re legally forced to spend. \n\n**Something is going to give here, and I suspect it\u2019s the price of uranium.**\n\nIn any case, when I saw the rate at which SPUT was issuing shares, I legged into a rather large pile of SPUT. I\u2019m also long a few producers along with some juniors for extra kick. (Please don\u2019t ask me which\u2014if I wanted to name them, I would have). Uranium just broke out to 5-year highs. New highs bring in publicity, which often brings in new buyers and the cycle repeats. I like buying new highs from a big base\u2014especially with SPUT out there playing Pac-Man. I pulled back my exposure all summer as I was awaiting something interesting. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see anything better than uranium for a while. Let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m suddenly back to being VERY fully invested.\n\nBy Tyler Durden - On zero hedge\n\nI'm IN. This could be massive.",

After messing around for a couple months I ended up around 40% up because of two tickers. Then I got into options. And went down. And down. And down. After two months was down 37% from up 40%. And I mulled over a strategy for awhile and liquidated everything and started over. Now I trade exclusively options. Mostly on the SPY. After 3 weeks I\u2019m back up 40%. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a fluke, but it\u2019s working. My question is- is this dumb? Is it sustainable (not the gains, trading only options)? Am I just dreaming and it\u2019s all gonna crash?",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Part 0: Intro\n\nSup freaks. Just came back from the moon and that shit is glorious. Here to officially introduce you to a play I\u2019ve been loading up on for weeks. The company is Genius Sports Limited, ticker $GENI, aka GENIE, or as Forrest Gump would say Jennaaaaay. You may be wondering why I\u2019m here? I\u2019m clearly (newly) rich, I should get a life. The answer is simple. I\u2019m a degenerate and it's short hunting season. Pow Pow. The FUD\u2019r of interest is forensic bitch and noted short seller Spruce Point Capital Management. These guys are incredibly ***unsuccessful*** in their calls so I take this as a major bull flag that they released a short report on GENI. Spruce\u2019s past successes include: MGNI (moon shot/money printer), DBX (DropBox), Nova (rose 88% after their post, talk about poor timing). These guys have the Midas Touch, ***anything their*** ***fungus filled fingernails*** ***stroke eventually end up moonshotting***; I\u2019m here to expedite the process. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kw02izf6xbm71.gif\n\nAnyway, Genius Sports Limited (GENI) is a tech company that collects data from sports events, processes it, and sells it to major gambling companies to run their sportsbooks (SKLZ, DKNG, Fanduel, Caesars etc). They are the [pick &amp; shovel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pick-and-shovel-play.asp) play of a rapidly growing sports gambling segment ([gambling record $44bn in revenue 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/08/10/us-gambling-revenue-to--break-44-billion-record-in-2021/)). They have 4 competitors (large moat) but only Sportradar offers any real competition. GENI has deals with NASCAR, MLB, NBA, NCAA and the English Premier League amongst others. They are also the [official data partner of the NFL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/nfl-agrees-to-data-rights-deal-with-genius-sports.html) holding exclusive rights; dump truck sized moat. Prominent investors include Cathie Wood, Mrs \u201cAverage Down at all Costs\u201d, Anpanaman \u201cGod Tier SPAC Wizard &amp; [wsb Yolo\u2019r](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/) (1.1m+ [\ud83d\ude33](https://emojipedia.org/flushed-face/))\u201d, amongst others (institutional ownership is 90%+). But, before we get into more specifics about the company + setup please watch this educational video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDWgqDBNXA)\n\nYup, I also love Christina Aguilera. So, gals put on your crop top and cargo pants, and fellas that backward fitted &amp; baggy jeans. Let\u2019s get groovy 90s style. Oh and Christina, please slide in my DM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bug2kfcaxbm71.gif\n\npls respond \n\n# Part 1: Fundamentals\n\nGENI is the backbone/infrastructure play on sports betting since they supply the  data that major gambling companies use.  GENI offers a suite of four products:\n\n* **GeniusLive**: this is a vertically integrated video service that allows teams or sports leagues to launch something like NBA League Pass. So the platform supports payments, live statistics, advertising, live streaming, and video on-demand, without having to buy a bunch of extra software/hardware. \n* **Sporttech:** Data capture, management and analysis tools that help leagues run their sport, unlock new revenue streams, and protect the integrity of their competitions. This is essentially the shit that has turned Facebook from some site used to scam on girls in  college into a company with revenues of over $10B a year. GENI collects all the data from degenerate bets, and provides the information gathered from them to their partners for future use. \n* **Sportsbook:** GENI provides the capability (but not requirement) to build out an entire sportsbook platform for their partners.  This provides all the benefits of having a sportsbook with none of the risk of spending capital on a field GENI partners are unfamiliar with.\n* **Media &amp; Engagement:**  GENI has the platform capabilities to allow their partners sports betting experience to enter into the world of social media.  You can chat in real time with other sports betters and complain that Nick Chubb stepped out at the 1 yard line and completely boned your 3 bet parlay. Through this platform GENI can leverage their fan engagement capabilities to drive advertising revenue and also promote future bets that may be to your liking based on your prior activity.\n\nAs  mentioned Genie\u2019s only real competition in this space is Sportradar, but Sportradar\u2019s [SPAC merger fell through](https://www.casino.org/news/sportradar-filed-for-a-highly-anticipated-ipo-on-tuesday/) after GENI swooped the exclusive rights to the NFL from under them -- ya know, the ole\u2019 Bulgarian ambush perfected by Vlad. \n\nThe NFL deal is pretty significant so let\u2019s dive into it: \n\n* **Expensive af**: Genius will [pay the NFL $120 million a year over six years](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/), with half paid in warrants making the [NFL own roughly 5% of GENI](https://www.yahoo.com/now/nfl-stake-genius-nearly-15-215504358.html). \n* **Locked in profit**:  Sportradar was pulling in 1.5% to 2% of in-play gross gaming revenue (GGR) on NFL wagers \\[[source](https://sportshandle.com/sportradar-genius-nfl-data/)\\].  Genius decided to go the opposite route by jacking up rates; asking for around 4% of operators\u2019 pre-match NFL betting revenues and 6% of in-play \\[[source](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)\\]. Operators are big mad about this:\n\n&gt;*\"They don\u2019t really have anything new,\u201d said another operator exec. \u201cThey are charging 4x for the same dataset.\u201d*\n\nThese guys are forced to use Genie\u2019s official NFL Data either because they are official partners of the NFL (FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesar), state regulations require use of official data, or the TV networks force them to subscribe to Genie data to advertise.  As of now, [DraftKings has already partnered with GENI in a multi year deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/draftkings-partners-with-genius-sports-for-sports-betting.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1628161383), PointsBet, WynnBet, BetMGM, Caesars, and Fox Bet have also signed deals w/ Genius ([NFL names Fox Bet, PointsBet, BetMGM and WynnBet as Approved Sportsbook Operators](https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/12973/nfl-names-fox-bet-pointsbet-betmgm-and-wynnbet-as-approved-sportsbook-operators)).  This leaves only Fanduel as yet to be disclosed, but likely already signed with Genie. Senior operator exec\u2019s legit crying that [its a monopoly.](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)lol. Sucks for them, great for us.\n\n* **Sticky**: The Sportradar deal was inked in 2019 and they got cucked in 2021. Sad. GENI is proactively making moves to make the deal last longer than 6yrs by hiring a good amount of NFL vets. Including [Steve Bornstein](https://www.sportico.com/personalities/executives/2021/genius-sports-steve-bornstein-1234637226/), he now leads GENI\u2019s US business. Mans spent a decade at the NFL managing the media strategy, and spent multiple decades at ESPN and ABC.  He also was the CEO of ESPN for a cool min.   \n* **NFL shills for GENI**:  This cannot be reinforced enough: the NFL\u2019s chief concern is the integrity of the data provided, and they are entrusting GENI, and ONLY GENI, with that.  They will also force anyone who wants to do business with the NFL to adhere to the NFL\u2019s core integrity policies by [agreeing to license all Official League Data from GENI](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-announces-agreements-with-four-approved-sportsbook-operators)\n\nTo put this in simpler terms: the NFL is telling the world -if you want us, you\u2019re gettin\u2019 some GENI.   GENI also issued warrants to the NFL (5% stake in GENI)  meaning when GENI is successful the NFL is successful so they are locked in and incentivized to push GENI to anyone who wants to work with them.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/l3e1xpncxbm71.gif\n\nThe reason I\u2019m bullish on Genie and jacked with shares/options other than the regular \u201c*it could squeeeeez*e\u201d play which I know, love, and bang the shit out of, and will explain this angle later, is because Genie secured the NFL deal at the perfect time. So, 3 yrs ago the supreme court overturned the ban on sports betting. The NFL has responded by moving its business model towards generating significant amts of revenue through betting. Sucks for Sporttrader, since for most of the time they held the  exclusive rights to NFL data, the [NFL actually considered gambling to be threat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)**\ud83d\ude31**, what a bad position to be in going into the gambling golden age.  \n\nThe NFL expects to make $270m in revenue from sports-betting this yr, and  NFL execs are super bullish about their future sports betting revenue, here\u2019s a quote from one: *\u201c*You can definitely see the market growing to $1 billion-plus of league opportunity over this decade.*\u201d\\[*[*source*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)*\\]* \n\nThe ideal sports-gambling legislation, the NFL concluded, would include substantive licensing requirements creating clear and transparent markets that protect consumers. Bets needed to be resolved using the league\u2019s official data (GENI!! - fuck you, pay me.). There had to be prohibitions on betting by insiders and the onus placed on operators to make certain that wasn\u2019t occurring. \\[[source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)\\] \n\nSo, when I invest I try to think of analogies that speak to me. This lets me invest in a more  logical and clear headed way. I compare this situation to the girl that sat next to you pre-OnlyFans. She used to eat ramen for lunch. A couple years later she has a poodle, a G Wagon, and goes by \u201cCyrstal like the champagne\u201d instead of Bernice. Yah, she twerking on cam because she found a money printer, the NFL will twerk to online-betting.  Analogy.\n\nThe whole industry will be twerking. \n\nCathie Wood\u2019s a month before she started yolo\u2019n on Jenaaay estimated x10 increase in domestic sports betting handle (the amount of money wagered by bettors is called \u201chandle\u201d), to $180 billion by 2025 , with revenue\u2019s for the sector projected to sky at a 31% CAGR. \n\nOne reason for this bullish prediction is the New Jersey example; since NJ legalized online sports betting mid-2018, they've seen online handle moon to $15 billion, 1/2 of this took place in 2020. (*Don\u2019t know why people would yolo on sports and* [*not options*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg9jpn/why_doesnt_everyone_only_trade_options_0_dte_spy/)*, but to each their own lulz*).\n\nSportsbetting is picking up so much steam, ESPN keeps their own tracker for up to date info on which states are going to let you yolo rent $ on Appalachian State vs Syracuse:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g68ri70exbm71.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95e3af4ca366eb8d64ba23ac0f970d51bdac69b8\n\nThere are only 3 states (Utah, Idaho, and Wisconsin - which btw if you live in any of these places - move the fuck out) that do not currently allow for sports betting and/or are in the process of allowing it.  Ground floor opportunity here.\n\n[Earlier this month, Wyoming Awarded Genius Sports Inaugural Sports Betting License - upping the number of states GENI can operate in to 15. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wyoming-awards-genius-sports-inaugural-213000130.html)\n\nSo clearly Jenaayy is a growth stock but let\u2019s look at the fundamentals &amp; also how Genie compares to the competition. (Genie, Jenaayy, GENI, Genius \u2026 lol sorry I\u2019m  dislexic). Ya so  Sportradar (Genie\u2019s rival)  is slated to go public this year and will likely trade in the $10-12B valuation range \\[[article/source](https://www.sportico.com/business/finance/2021/sportradar-ten-billion-valuation-1234623092/)\\].\n\nSportradar filed its S-1 a few weeks ago which provides historical financial performance.  Making some simple assumptions on continued revenue growth (based on historic CAGR) we can figure out Sportradar\u2019s valuation multiples which we\u2019ll compare to Jenaayyy\u2019s.  I\u2019m also throwing in Draftkings in the comparison as a high growth (but unprofitable), pure play sportsbook leader.  You can see below how the financials compare:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f6alqkfxbm71.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c25a5c75f0ca5b4498d9883053284138e273ec7\n\nI would argue Genie and Sportradar should trade at a premium to Draftkings as they have an effective duopoly on the sports betting data market.  Draftkings\u2019 sports book market is getting more competition from new players, which is causing customer acquisition costs to skyrocket.  HOWEVER, as more of these players enter the market, they\u2019ll have to buy all their official sports data from Jenaayy!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fk2cxfmgxbm71.gif\n\nLet\u2019s get serious for a sec,, below is a valuation comparison and as you can see Genie trades at a discount to DKNG and at a premium to Sportradar\u2019s expected IPO pricing valuation of $26-29 or $7.4B - $8.2B. It\u2019s expected that Sportradar will trade in the $10B - $12B range once it starts trading.  Genie should probs trade at a premium to Sportradar valuation given the enormous potential of its exclusive NFL deal over the coming years. Vauling Genie at a premium would imply a conservaitve estimate of $25 to $30 price per share based on the company\u2019s CURRENT projections..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f75x253ixbm71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a6d0efe77944fcd133102ba7e3424f6b93b026\n\nGenie reported Q2 earnings on 9/8 which beat estimates.  Revenue was $55.8M and EBITDA $5.2M vs. street estimates of revenue $53.8M and EBITDA $1.7M.  Genie tightened its FY2022E guidance to $250M-$260M of revenue (which was increased in Q1 from $190M) and EBITDA of $10M-$20M.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for i though, Wall Street analysts agree with their Price Targets:\n\n* Benchmark BUY $33 PT\n* Oppenheimer BUY $32 PT\n* Goldman Sachs BUY $31 PT\n* Craig Hallum BUY $30 PT\n* Needham BUY $28 PT\n* Singular Research BUY $28 PT\n\nThese 12-month price targets equate to an average $30.33 or 43 % upside from the current stock price.\n\nSome other data points:\n\n* Tute ownership 44.17%\n* GENI is in a $330M net cash position \n* Does it pay a dividend? Of course not\n* Free cash flow is absolutely atrocious - the company is in reinvest and GROWTH mode\n* Holy fuck is price to sales looks steep based on 2020A at 27.9x, but gets cut in half by 2022E at 12.3x due to massive growth\n* Positive seasonality outlook, very volatile but shows recently strong performance\n* Sales forecast looks great, with a forecasted growth of 126% from 2020 to 2022\n* First quarter group revenues of 52% year-over year\n* First quarter group adj. EBITDA up 414% to 9.3M\n* 6-year exclusive partnership with NFL\n* Has exclusive events with almost every professional sports agency, as well as tournaments\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74rp8m1jxbm71.png?width=1268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09b50991702a45037e079fd174fc5bf6f870269c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/hyzbzw4kxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 2: Institutional fuckery\n\nSpruce Point Capital Management [issued a hit piece](https://www.casino.org/news/genius-sports-stock-could-see-big-declines-says-noted-short-seller/) on Genie. Their primary claim is that Genius is a \u201cmiddleman\u201d with an \u201cinferior business model\u201d saying the stock could fall 60% to 80%, so a PT of $3.25 to $6.50. Well first off Spruce, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/uk0m1vhlxbm71.gif\n\nWith that being said, Spruce is clearly wrong. Given Spruce\u2019s history of abject failure I would go further and say this report is baseless FUD. So, why would Spruce put itself in the path of a runaway train like Jenaay? Seems crazy tbh. Welp they\u2019re known as a [\u201cSmash &amp; Grab\u201d short seller,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-jolts-activist-short-hedge-funds-into-adapt-or-die-mode) so these guys give friends an early view of their calls so they can front run the market before it's released to the public, profiting from the panic.  Spruce\u2019s hit piece was released Aug 5th, the stock rose the entire day and it\u2019s been in a legit uptrend since then, no panic lol. If this is Spruce\u2019y bois M.O. they just fukd their company and their friends with another horrible call.

More importantly however, is this rising floor Cathie is building into the stock price. She is known for having strong convictions and sticking to them.

I\u2019m going to do a breakdown of similar data from past analysis, including FTD rates and float comparisons, institutional ownership and recalculation of all this data (differs from online). \n\nAs of now, the outstanding shares listed on Yahoo and sites such as [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/geni/statistics/) is 191.51M shares. \\[However, the float varies, with Yahoo listing it as 63.36M and other sites listing it as 58.66M.\\] \n\n**The current float can be calculated as follows:**  \nSPAC IPO:    27.6M shares\n\nUnlocked PIPE:   33M shares\n\nFollow-On Offering:   22M shares\n\n**Total tradable float:**   **82.6M shares**\n\n**Lock up:**\n\nManagement (34.9M shares / 18% ownership) lockup expires on 11/17 and the SPAC Sponsor lockup (6.825M shares / 3.5% ownership) lockup expires on 10/17.  Apax, the private equity owner of Genius (60.2M shares / 30.9% ownership) lockup will expire on 10/17.  The gory details are all laid out here\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img i8iutvjtxbm71...*\n\nThey also list the institutional ownership as around 44-45% but doing some calculations shows this is higher. \n\n**So is this an overcount or undercount? Lets see.** \n\n**Begin Math:** \n\nGiven **191.51M shares outstanding** as the general consensus across various financial sources, we can look into the overall preferred shares and institutional buyouts across several 13F filings and aggregated data on Fintel and StockAnalysis:\n\n**Top 3 Institutional Holdings:**\n\n1. Caledonia Investments - 16,305,582 shares\n2. Fred Alger Management - 15,046,102 shares\n3. Dmy Sponsor LLC - 6,825,000 shares\n\nThese top 3 holders combined have 38176684 shares or about 19.93% of the shares outstanding. \n\nThere are 137 other funds that also own shares directly, for a total of 63694543 shares or about another 33.26% of the shares outstanding. \n\nTherefore, institutional ownership alone is around (19.93% + 33.26%) or 53.19% of shares outstanding. \n\nNext we can take a look at the insider transactions. This has a general consensus of 19.25%, indicating that a total of 72.44% of the outstanding shares are owned currently. \n\nNow lets take a look at merger deals, ETFs and ownership through mutual funds. \n\nWe can see that the top holders for Q2 of 2021 in aggregate own 17,422,176 shares or about 9.10% of shares outstanding.  \\[source fintel\\]\n\n**Our total ownership of outstanding shares becomes 81.54%.** \n\nHowever, now we need to account for any institutions holding shares through these funds and for this reason some ETFs are excluded. Fred Alger Management has 15,046,102 shares of GENI yet through the ATFV Alger\u2019s ETF, they end up owning approximately\u2026 oh wait.. Lol\u2026 approximately an equivalent of 75 shares of GENI. Okay so looking at these ETFs looks like they have negligible impact on the float. \n\n**TLDR; The float for $GENI is about 35,352,746 shares or about 18.46% of outstanding shares.**  **With 4.14M** shares shorted this means that approximately **11.7% of the float is shorted.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvse6w5vxbm71.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab367a73760c2e67324adb2459b7797512f474f7\n\nFrom the FTD angle we see that nice giant spike with the price staying stable/bleeding up. This type of pattern I\u2019ve found to give more pop, and it\u2019s something I looked for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cudusyyvxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 4: Flow\n\n***Options Flow***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img q9vahxuwxbm71...*\n\nOrder Sentiment: ***Bullish*** AF. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3brekt. 77% of options activity over the last 30 days has been ***bullish.*** 66% of money invested has been placed on ***bullish*** bets of the stock rising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bya2smuxxbm71.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e21f20b87f47c05a5df9c39ede3b8005e30a33b2\n\nCall OI has been trending up over the last month, you can see an increase in OI for higher strikes as GENI\u2019s share price has increased 34.43% over the last month. The smart money has been betting on the price increase continuing. \n\nThe option chain: there are only monthly options, and the options chain itself is somewhat condensed to near the money strikes. This is all actually a good thing. It is forcing investors to streamline their investments into a more concentrated area, which has a greater overall impact on both hedging requirements and overall stock price. This is exactly how a MM or a shorty in duress would ***not*** want the options chain to look.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6d2c7huzxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 5: Positions &amp; Prayer\n\n20k shares\n\nx100 25c 1/21/2022\n\nx220 22.5c 10/15\n\nx200 30c 1/21/2022\n\nx220 22.5c 10/15\n\n# END:\n\nTLDR; High short interest.

Wall Street, and WSB get more excited about a disrupting, green, or new tech company than a lesbian visiting phra nang cave. This one is exciting. We've all seen the DD, 140% beat on revenue.\n\nThe kicker? They've double their counties served this quarter from the last. That's only about 70 counties. Incase you were wondering, there's over 3000 in the country.

Why the spike in borrow fee? Maybe they hoped we were still as dumb as our early GME days, and they could drop it like a father holding a baby on Maury, just finding out he is NOT the father.

        "selftext": "What's up Degernates?  The $DUDE here with my periodic \"Dude Diligence\" reports on $CLOV - Clover Health Investments Corp and thoughts on potential price action for the upcoming week.  Be prepared to read a little bit, but it will be worth your time if you're seriously considering trading CLOV\n\nI want to start off with a quick intro- I'm a long-time lurker here on WSB but rarely post.  I joined a little over a year and a half ago right before COVID hit as the subreddit was on the verge of breaking 1M Degenerates.  I spend a bit more of my time on Twitter and am active there if you care to follow me aka, The $DUDE  ([https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a)).\n\nAnyway, I don't want to make this too long but I've been trading for about 16 years which started with a single $2000 deposit as a college student in my early 20s which was a good chunk of my net worth at the time.  That $2K has grown significantly over the years through working, trading and has been diversified into real estate as well.  I work in tech for a publicly traded software company and now have few healthy trading accounts (primary trading, IRA and Roth IRAs) where I mainly swing/momentum trade some YOLOs and occasionally invest longer term if I feel there's a disruptive technology/company w/ high upside potential. \n\nOriginally I came to WSB for the memes and then quickly realized it was a really helpful community w/ useful crowd-sourced info, strategies and data in addition to the solid meme game.  That was before it exploded 10X over about a 6 month period time leading up to the GME and AMC squeeze craziness earlier this year.\n\nWhile I will say most of the info here is still good for the most part, you do have to dig a bit deeper now, verify a little more often and pushback on a lot more misinformation than in the \"early days\".  And that brings me to the point I'd like to speak about today.  Misinformation and how it has run rampant especially when it comes to Clover Health Investments Corp aka $CLOV.\n\nI've been trading this stock since late Feb and seen the many ups, then downs, then big ups again and then downs.  But more than anything, I've seen and still see the disruptive potential of A.I. in a dinosaur of an industry that is Healthcare.  Here's my fresh take since I know there are a lot of new traders/investors in CLOV and a definite uptick of late in interest to potentially invest moving forward... (Disclaimer:  I am not a financial analyst, this is not financial advice, it is solely made up of my own personal opinions.  I do currently hold a position in CLOV for obvious reasons once you read through this)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**STORY TIME**\n\nI'm going to start this all off with a little story...\n\nOnce upon a time, there was this new fangled company called Tesla and it was forward thinking and it was technology obsessed and was innovation first and they wanted to build cars.  \n\nWell, the collective good ol boys (GoB) club that makes up the automotive industry saw this quirky autist lead company and laughed at them and pointed fingers at their silly electric motors with \"auto pilot\" and weird frunks and batteries- WTF??.  \n\nThe GoB don't like disruption.  Instead, the GoB loooove the status quo- because they're on top and in control, so why wouldn't they?\n\nThis TSLA company didn't care that they were getting the cold shoulder and started to build their cars that were never going to succeed and they were actually pretty f\\*cking bad ass.  \n\n\"There's no way this TSLA is a viable long-term company- they don't have the recharging infrastructure, there will never be adoption by the masses and ultimately they'll run out of money, \" sneered all the GoB execs along with the know-it-all stock analysts, big banks, Jim Cramer and all his Wall St. buddies.  \n\nAnd then something weird happened ...people started buying these electric cars and buying them and buying them even faster.   We all know how this story ends.  The GoB are now scrambling to catch up and acquire similar technologies to compete w/ the O.G. disruptor.\n\nThis is what happens with disrupting companies- they see problems and their leaders are visionary problem solvers and refuse to follow inefficiency and the status quo.  And it's weird because when these disruptive companies pop up, you'd think they would be praised and their industries would welcome their new ways of thinking.  But that's not real life- instead they're mocked and told they'll never make it and to give up because deep down the GoB know the legacy way of thinking is in danger of drastically changing and all of the sudden the go from leader to playing catch up.   So the collusion begins and they do all they can to ensure there's a failure to launch w/ negative publicity, or just ignored altogether or shorted or all of the above.  Whatever it takes to kill off the \"perceived threat\". \n\nWell, there's another company similar to TSLA that's looking to disrupt another Dinosaur industry- Healthcare and healthcare may be the oldest most dinosaur of the dinosaurs...  This company is $CLOV and before many of you in here sneer and mock- hear me out over the next few paragraphs.  I will support my DD w/ data, Press Releases, Quarterly Financials, etc, not opinions...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER HEALTH IS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY FIRST**\n\nFirst and foremost $CLOV needs to actually be seen and recognized for what it is at it's core- NOT a meme stock.  Clover Health, at its foundation is a Technology/ Artificial Intelligence company that just so happens to focus on the Healthcare/Insurance space.   It is a meme stock because it's heavily talked about here on WSB, but this is actually a long-term growth stock with rapidly improving fundamentals, massive growth... and down the list, the potential of a squeeze, but that is secondary in my mind.  I'l Long on CLOV\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER HEALTH's MISSION STATEMENT**\n\n*Clover is a healthcare technology company helping members live their healthiest lives with its Medicare Advantage plans. On a mission to improve every life, Clover uses its proprietary technology platform to collect, structure, and analyze health and behavioral data to improve medical outcomes and lower costs for patients. As a company whose business goals fully align with its members' health needs, Clover works with members and their doctors to become a valued partner. Clover has offices in Nashville, San Francisco, Jersey City, and Hong Kong.*\n\nIt's a next-generation disruptor in that it has developed proprietary AI technology called the Clover Assistant (CA). \n\n**Clover Assistant Explanation Video:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k)\n\nWhat's great about this is that it integrates with all FHIR EHR's (Electronic Health Record systems) ...hospital systems, doctor's offices, pharmacies, etc. use to store and manage patient info can all integrate easily with CA.  This allows for real-time data visualization &amp; reporting at doctor's fingertips so they can not only make the best possible decisions for the health of their patients based on all available info across all EHR systems, but also concurrently make the most cost-effective decision from a business standpoint (improved margins compared to competitors w/o a similar type technology.)\n\n**Aug 10, 2021 PR Link:**  Now integrates with all FHIR-enabled EHR's\n\n[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs)\n\n**Sept 8, 2021 PR Link:**  Clover Health partners with largest EHR company AthenaHealth for seamless integration of Clover Assistant\n\n[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market)\n\nYou want to know what is also pretty f\\*cking awesome?  They could also potentially license this software to other healthcare orgs at some point, i.e. Software-as-a-Service or SaaS.  I work in this space and have been selling SaaS contracts for the better part of 2 decades.  \n\nMy previous company had a stock price of $15 when they were selling \"perpetual licenses\" aka, dinosaur software sales model.  ...when they switched over to a SaaS their stock price climbed over $500 over the next 10 years.  Did I play my ESPP during time?  Uh, you know I did!  In short... just this software component alone could have a massive potential if played correctly.  Of note, I don't think that is currently in the works at the moment, so none of that potential is priced in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET**\n\nCLOV plays heavily in the Medicare and Medicare Advantage space.  Currently citizens in the US are eligible for Medicare at 65 years old and about 60M people or 18% of the country are on it as of 2019: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xkm6dlk8o5n71.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48ef0dd7523641c089b72e8da7d0f9f468cb889d\n\nLook at the Baby-Boomer jump beginning around 2006 and that sharp increase.  It's expected to continue the rapid rise and if the eligible age is dropped from 65 to 60, that could add another 24+ Million (a potential 40% bump) to its total lives managed under the program.\n\nA unique component that CLOV has when it comes to lives managed is that it has a direct contracting entity (DCE) program \n\n**Info on DCE Program:** [https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/](https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/)\n\n**Quick Video on Program:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM)\n\n(...and someone correct me if I state this inaccurately) but my understanding of DCE (and it's by far the most exciting growth component that I've seen so far related Clover's massive upward revenue trajectory from Q1 to Q1 ) ...under direct contracting entity, Doctors are able to sign patients up individually, outside of the normal Oct 15 - Dec 7th Medicare Open Enrollment period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EXPLOSION IN REVENUE GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR**\n\nHere are Data from CLOV's most recent Q2 10Q filing on Aug 11, 2021:  \n\n**Total Q2 2021 Revenue was $412.5M, which was a 139.7 increase YoY** compared to $172.1M in Q2 of 2020.  $216.4M of that was just from Direct Contracting- are you seeing why I'm pretty stoked on this hyper-growth company?\n\nTotal **revenues for the full 2021 year are now expected to increase from $810-$130M which was reported following Q1 earnings to $1.4- $1.5B** following Q2 earnings.\n\nTotal Lives (customers) under Clover Health management at the end of Q2 was approx. 129,000, **an increase of 126.3% YoY GROWTH!!!**  This has mainly come from the DCE program since it has only been available to Clover since they were included in it along with 52 other companies earlier this year. \n\n**Lives under Clover Assistant management grew by 229% YoY.**\n\n**Clover expects a significant increase in total aligned beneficiaries on Jan 1, 2022**, when claims aligned beneficiaries for 2022 become active - Uh, you probably want to jump onboard sooner than later given this projection.\n\n If this alone isn't enough to get you to jump on board blindly w/ no questions asked, I don't know what to tell you.  If you can tell, when Q3 earnings are announced on or around Nov 11, 2021, CLOV could rocket if Q3 report is anything like Q2, especially with a couple of weeks of Medicare Open Enrollment being included in this upcoming ER.  \n\n**CLOVER HEALTH's EXEC TEAM:**\n\nTake a look, you have a mix of former Google, Uber, (remember how I said it's a technology company)  United Health Group, McKesson\n\nExec. Summary:  [https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/about-us/our-story](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/about-us/our-story)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER RAPID EXPANSION IN COUNTIES WHERE THEIR SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE**\n\nCLOV just expanded its market from 108 counties in 8 states to 209 in 9 states (101 county increase) as of June 24, 2021, meaning essentially all of the earnings data I listed above were from the smaller market, so growth will continue to accelerate rapidly\n\nPR Link: [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets)\n\nIf that wasn't exciting enough, shortly after announcing the new counties, they announced on Aug 3, 2021 they will be entering a new state, the 10th, with their new partnership w/ ValueH.  That state just happens to be Florida- the third most populous in the US and a huge Medicare state.\n\nPR Link: [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-valueh](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-valueh)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HEADWINDS, MISCONCEPTIONS &amp; OUTRIGHT LIES**\n\nMarket manipulation w/ the price is probably the biggest headwind.  CLOV, along with GME and AMC have got to be the most manipulated shares in the history of the stock market.  Market makers and HF have an uncanny ability to nearly always pin the price on Fridays just below the options Max Pain price collecting premium for them and allowing them to do it cycle after cycle so they're making up the cost plus some of whatever the borrowing fee is.  The more of the free float investors buy up and hold, the less ability they have to manipulate.\n\nI've heard people talk negatively about losses.  Well, when you're in healthcare, and we're in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, your Medical Cost Ratios will get out of wack temporarily and that is the case over the past couple of quarters.  MCR was at 111% during Q2, however, Q2 of 2020 (before much of the COVID expense hit) it was 70.1% according to their earnings report. \n\n[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db) \n\nFree Cash Flow (FCF) has also been talked about and has been affected as this company is in growth mode, however, it has improved tremendously: +31% from Q1 to Q2.  It will be interesting to see where it goes for Q3.  Definitely moving in the right direction toward getting into the black.\n\nAlso much of the expense costs for Q2 were one-time line items related to stock compensation and the cost of warrants to the company (warrants along added -$134.5M in debt)\n\nAs of the end of Q2, CLOV had $630M cash and equivalents in the bank, so they can sustain losses for awhile without issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HOW TO TRADE CLOV**\n\nOK, this is getting kind of long, so I may type up a more comprehensive list with more info, but I want to get into some of the anomalies if you choose to trade this stock.\n\nShort Attacks:  Watch out for what looks like a mass selloff right at market open almost every day, shorts always short millions of shares each morning to kill off momentum and scare paper hands and inexperienced traders.  It generally comes back after about 10:30-11am ET when the shorts return their shares because they're just looking to scalp 10-40 cents or so each day and then return them for some profit.  If we're buying up all the float, and not allowing them be be shorted, HF and short's wont be able to do this and we start to gain ground.\n\nWhich brings me to this- IF there's anything I hope you learn from reading my DD today, it's this:  **DO NOT BUY CALL OPTIONS ON THIS STOCK.  If you do, they will most likely end worthless on Friday's and you will lose your money.**  \n\nI know options are normally an attractive opportunity to get into a stock inexpensively because if it moon's at some point, you make a grip on a small investment, but I've been trading this for months, and seen it happen many times over- you will lose your money.  \n\nInstead, BUY ACTUAL SHARES!   Help buy up the float and HODL!!  This is going to be a volatile potentially few months as we start making progress vs. the shorts to jack them with an impending squeeze, options have not been working, nor will they, it appears, in the short term.  There may be some opportunity to buy and profit from options once momentum is in bulls favor, but that time is not now.\n\nI hope this was helpful, I know it's long, but if you made it to the end here, really consider getting into this stock, it has a lot of things going for it and it's only $8 right now.  Even without the squeeze potential that exists, this could easily be $20-30 with it's extremely rapid growth of their Direct Contracting.  If you're holding it long, then when the squeeze does happen, it's just gravy.  \n\nI may have missed a few things, but if so, I'll just follow this up with another post here in the next day or two.  Would love to hear all of your feedback and/or differing opinions on this.  Happy investing fellow autists!!!",

        "selftext": " \n\nListen up!  Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your money**.** Too much, or too good to be true?  Im being conservative. Hear me out.   \n\n**First, I shall Flex:**  \n\n1) I am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I can't figure it out, I know who to ask. \n\n2) I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.  \n\nWhy flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing matters just a little.  With that said, once more, listen up! \n\n**The Pickle:** \n\nYou youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is, there is NO effective treatment. \n\nThe FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has significant adverse events.  The risk of brain swelling requires serial Brain MRIs.  It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k.  Most incredible is that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the FDA still approved it because the need is that severe.  President Biden recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix:  $SAVA**\n\nCassava Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive function in its CMS trial.  The degree and duration of improvement have NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic. It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.  \n\nYes, we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc.  A genuine criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.  \n\nWithout getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere criticisms is Phase 3 trials.  There is no valid argument against this statement.  This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use absolute phrases.  If you take away only one point from this article, then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more about him later).  Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy.  Be angry, fellow apes, be angry.   Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal? They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\" A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit) out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.   \n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second, sold their shares.  SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog (https://ad-science.org/), Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.  \n\n1) Jordan Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that patients are literally dying as they wait.  WTF!? Why, why why??  If you aren't angry, somethings wrong with you.  JT states he is concerned for patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected, JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly. In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is horrendous (3% success rate)?  Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD in its purest form.  \n\n2) Then why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my position by 30%.  With that said, Im not surprised the masses started selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent, it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance. \n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue. \n\nFifty million patients are suffering from AD globally.  6 million of those patients reside in the US.  Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs $20k annually, just a bit over a third  the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment options).  The current stock price is $50.  The overly conservative valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia. \n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment. Thats devastating for patients, but families?  It's not uncommon for families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed!  Severely, painfully, and gravely unaddressed.  \n\nI have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process.  JT is only the face of this farce.  Behind him are many short positions making a 100 million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their short-term gain.  There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or short-term price action.  There is something much more sinister.  Biogen has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved.  Now it is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently, a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's AD drug.  This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no other therapy on the market.  Well, what happens if a new, more effective medication shows up?  \n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack to our Villian JT.  JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works.  Why?  I speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer.  There is little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less.  When that happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug.  Biogen already has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to rejuvenate the companies earnings.  Then expediently and as expected, Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI believe that is the root issue.  Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam!  A group of us have gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1) Im expecting the SP to bounce.  After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a perfect overreaction play.  If you dont know what Im talking about, you can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n\n2) Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"  \n\n3) Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks.  (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n\n4) Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted with utilization of &gt;90%.  It'll take very little to make SAVA move, big.  Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.  \n\nI have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on SAVA.  My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!).  I'll finish with one last piece of advice.  Over 19 years of investing, my most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual published results, but apparently, her opinion counts?  Comments of her blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on to something.\"  In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical details are fooling many.   DFV saw something well before masses, and he was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen, then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs. a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma. \n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor.  Do your own DD before making any decisions.",

I went through my archives and put together the attached chart of GME stock float and short interest over the last several months. As everyone has noticed, the float number recently reported by Yahoo Finance looks to be off. I can't explain why, but based on my experience with such data, float does not fluctuate that greatly on a day to day basis. It will be interesting to see what the data bears out over the next several days. I hope this is of interest to followers of GameStop stock (I currently hold no positions in GME).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ombohs8wo4n71.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f3ab305bf90e5d3f09471a3c4f0b75a253874dc",

        "selftext": "UPDATE: Expanding on my time horizon on this movement. Still in play and getting more likely by the hour.\n\nWe've been following $IRNT since the post market jump when it went from $16 to $40 in AH. It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it's been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that's why I'm calling attention to it.\n\nThe setup is simple:\n\n1. The float is currently 1.3M shares\n2. It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float\n3. Almost 100% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you're just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration.\n4. If the $20 strike becomes ITM, 2X of the float becomes claimed instantly. That is more shares than currently exist and rapidly speeds up the squeeze.\n5. It is currently unknown how many shorts exist, but the hard-to-borrow fee is nearing 700% and indication that there is some sort of short interest at play.\n\nIf $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of PHUN, OPGO &amp; GME.\n\n$IRNT will very likely run some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.\n\nDISCLOSURE: I have 600 17.5 Strike calls for Sep 17th &amp; 1000 37 Strike calls for Sep 17th.  \nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.  \n\n\nThanks to /u/Undercover_in_SF for the original DD on this play.

The investment (\"YOLO\") below is a large but recoverable percent of my portfolio, in-line with my personal risk tolerance. Not intended as investment advice. I may modify (add, reduce, or even close out) my position at any time.*\n\n**TL/DR:** AAWW is critically undervalued. COVID has all but annihilated international air travel volumes, driving up the price of air freight. Short term shipping disruptions have caused prices to soar, spilling over in to the air freight market. Analysts are expecting this disruption to resolve quickly, but are missing the shifts that airlines are making to narrow body jets and the impact on air freight. AAWW will have high earnings for years, and its current P/E of 4 is a joke. 13.6% of the float is shorted, and Atlas Air is free to reinitiate buybacks at the end of this month. AAWW's market cap could double and it still would trade at the rock bottom P/E of 8. Bullish AF.\n\n\\------\n\n**Thesis**\n\nAtlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.\n\n**Background**\n\nAtlas Air is an outsourced air services company that provides charter and other air services (\"Airline Operations\") as well as leasing out their owned aircraft. Critically, the Airline Operations account for the vast majority of revenues (&gt;95%), and AAWW has a very, very heavy focus and exposure to air freight.\n\nYou may know that commercial flights also typically carry cargo. When COVID decimated international air travel, it left a few limited carriers to ship air freight internationally. Atlas Air filled that void and is making big money doing it.\n\n**Short Term Prospects**\n\nBeyond the COVID situation mentioned above, oceanliners have been backed up dramatically causing a squeeze in ocean freight prices. Normally, air freight costs very roughly 4-5x that of an oceanliner. But with surging rates from oceanliners, [air freight has now become competitive for many companies](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/a-perfect-storm-for-container-shipping/21804500) and it is spilling over in to a squeeze on air freight. [Here's another article joking about car tires flying first class.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/air-cargo-boom-has-car-tires-flying-first-class-11630242001) So we know that Atlas Air is going to have a pretty stellar third quarter. One for their corporate history books, to be sure. But how do they fare long-term?\n\n**Long Term Prospects**\n\nAs a side note, I believe this is where the shorts are getting it very, very wrong. *I think* they are confident that while AAWW will have a great quarter, the freight rates will come back down again and AAWW will operate with only 'modest' profits like it did pre-COVID. What they are missing is a huge transformation in the airline industry from wide-body to narrow-body jets. Narrow-body jets carry far less cargo. Greenlight Capital did a fantastic job laying this out in it's July 26, 2021 investor letter (page 4, \"Air Freight\"):\n\n&gt;While there has been some recovery in passenger aviation, airlines are emphasizing narrow-body planes, which carry less freight than wide-body planes. Compared to 2019, current air freight demand is about 10% higher and capacity is about 10% lower. The result is that cargo rates have exploded.  \nSupply will be slow to come on-line. Some passenger planes are being converted to freighters, but conversion capacity for wide-bodies is limited and the aggregate impact of this will be modest. Meanwhile, air freight companies trade at tiny multiples of what investors assume to be peak profits. The implied cost of equity is quite high, which makes it difficult to justify adding assets. As a result, air freight companies are in no rush to order new planes, and in any case, new orders would take several years to build. The result is rates and profits are likely to be higher than expected for quite some time.\n\n(Sorry, I tried to link the letter but the spam bot didn't like the URL.)\n\n**Short Interest**\n\nFor some reason I will never understand, at a P/E of 4 with incredible foreseeable cashflows, some people have decided to short 13.6% of the outstanding shares. To be clear, this is not GameStop. But it is a high short interest in a stock with earnings prospects surging by the day as freight rates increase. It certainly doesn't hurt. But the story gets even better...\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts**\n\nOkay, so perhaps you believe me that AAWW is critically undervalued, that they're going to make some amazing Q3/Q4 profits, and that their long term prospects are pretty fantastic too. What will drive this rapid revaluation in the coming months? The answer was subtly slipped in to the last earnings call (google \"AAWW Transcripts Q2\u00a02021 Earnings Call\"). Spencer Schwartz, the EVP and CFO answered a question and stated:\n\n&gt;As far as the CARES Act restrictions, so the restrictions with regard to not being able to pay dividends or repurchasing shares, those expire at the end of September.\n\nI simply cannot imagine that in this time of record earnings, AAWW will not return that value to shareholders. If they were to announce a share buyback once the CARES Act restrictions lap, we could see AAWW finally get to a reasonable share price. I truly believe this could double in the short-term.\n\n**YOLO**\n\n$108k YOLO on Calls expiring in October and January.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzuyru804pn71.png?width=1268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82071fc0ff9d130964a81c208de196c9edc0d71f",

We'll ol' Cbass is here to welcome you to this *definitely-not-a-cult* group of investors who are, throughout the internet, highly **R**egarded for **E**xcellence, **T**houghtfulness, **A**droitness and **R**espectably **D**istinguished **E**loquence in **D**iscourse (*occasionally* going by the acronym: **RETARDED**).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Hey everybody! We're all getting laid!** ^((Behind the Wendy's dumpster))\n\n* ***Additional tl;dr's sprinkled throughout, because reading is hard.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPart 1. Technically Anal\n\nPart 2. Dynamically-expanding Dildos\n\nPart 3. A Conspiracy of Idiocy\n\nPart 4. Rise now, a Man of the Watch\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 1. Technically Anal**\n\nSo this past week saw a considerable breakout of the $9 resistance wall and a concomitant FOMOing into the ticker with FD's destined to Lambo or Burn. Well those FDs are either now ash or in a giant gasoline-soaked pyre, but let's have a look at the charts to see if any of the poor bastards holding 9/17 $17 calls can be saved.\n\nFirst, a general look at the important lines:\n\n[So many lines, so much value](https://preview.redd.it/cnrsj3ehy2n71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95d5beb400d7024a6196736106457fd6c843879)\n\nThe most important level on here is the one I've labeled \"Launch #1\", though at this point the \"#1\" is looking smidgen unnecessary. First established on the gap-down on Oct. 6 of last year, it provided resistance on three occasions afterward (yellow arrows for the simpletons), with the last ending in a massive breakout to all-time highs.\n\nThe $9.08 line is the second most important line on the chart, in my possibly chromosome-deficient opinion. First established on Mar. 15 of this year after the bounce from all-time lows, it provided some level of resistance immediately afterward, but in the post *squeeze-that-wasn't-a-squeeze* world of the past few months it has become the ultimate resistance, a titanic, 700-foot wall of ice and sorrow towering over the pitiable bag holders huddling beneath its monstrously cold heights. Before this week, there were three prior attempts so surmount the Wall, all ending failure.\n\nOf next and most immediate importance is the $8 mark. I have it as $7.94 as there is a small case for its origin story beginning on Mar. 25 of this year. However, like the $9 mark, its true importance has been found recently, and ***cannot be overstated***: This line, however pitiful, represents a **higher low** and thus holding that line is of critical importance for the prospects of any near-term upward action.\n\nThe orange downtrend line was the last of the downtrend lines, and crossing it resulted in the most recent attempt at the Wall of $9.\n\nThe green line is **the bottom**, a place of green pastures and buxom women, where the burdens of your bags will vanish away . . . because you've passed from this world and its worries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext is a chart looking at the $11.13 mark:\n\n[Fibonacci, because Italian people](https://preview.redd.it/86tdxc76z2n71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b1f1e37ef85a53788c7100bddb17f9d64889a2)\n\nAs shown, the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $11.13 is shaping up to be a very important line. Indeed, it is soon to over shadow the $11.80 breakout line in that regard. On the dump following the June push, the ticker found support at $11.16 on Jun. 21, and subsequently it opened and dumped down from that level on a Jul. 6 (yellow arrows for simpletons). And just this week we saw the ticker reach up to **exactly** $11.13, before getting summarily thrown back off the top of the Wall. At this point, I think a breakout of $11.13 probably results in a significant push up. But we're getting well ahead of ourselves with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a TA wunderkind, I've turned my head to just the right angle and found a sliver of hope for the hopeless Men of the Watch:\n\n[Two girls &amp; a cup: can't possibly fail](https://preview.redd.it/ary603egz2n71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4e5b5f27b60656be73760dee5251e0e1d79e6b8)\n\nThe good news is it looks like a cup &amp; handle formation. The bad news is that *usually* a cup &amp; handle is a pause in an uptrend. Here, however, you have a downtrend into the cup (the giant pink arrow for the simpletons). This is a great example of Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart &amp; indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear. So, let's just call this a positive, because we have little else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at 1hr chart, let's see if we can find some more copium:\n\n[I see Higher Lows from my house!](https://preview.redd.it/dyaiz8hnz2n71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f6ec421727eeedc62a68c18d33c86a25cd03e9d)\n\nAfter the post earnings dump, CLOV briefly had a breakdown below the $8 support before rallying back up to test the $9 Wall, repeatedly. In that time, it found itself in a new channel between $8.40 and $8.60, thus establishing $8.40 as a **new, higher low**. This, as much as the Great YOLO Brigade of Labor Day Weekend, was the cause of the breakout on Tuesday. Basically, the chart was screaming that a breakout was incoming, YOLO brigade be damned.\n\nThe copium for next week is whether or not another higher low can be put in at $8.60. Like any good Man of the Bag Watch I have to hope it can, because if I try to leave, my portfolio gets hunted down and beheaded.\n\nThe worse and therefore more likely scenario is a breakdown all the way back to $8, undoing several weeks worth of upward progress. The absolute worst case is a *true* failure of $8 and a return to all-time lows. This would be a dagger in the heart, and unless someone knows a Red Woman, we're fucked.\n\n[Winning, winning so fuckin' hard right now](https://preview.redd.it/8zf0arxvz2n71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55ff09023716e9894e0f4fd672ec56fa1d4808de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 2. Dynamically-expanding Dildos** **^((for maximum gapping)****)**\n\nIn true Clovtard fashion, my knowledge of this company prior to purchasing shares was \"it does some techy stuff with healthcare.\" Which, it turns out, is basically all you need to know. This company is one of those that seems complex and super high-tech, but in reality is more basic bitch than your average Instagram thot. That being said, it might still work out for them... after all, do you see some of these basic bitches that blow up on Instagram? Living proof that ***literally anything*** is possible.\n\nBut just in case someone cares (and to keep the Clovtards from reeing in the comments), here's a look at the company underlying the CLOV:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Business Model***\n\n* **TL;DR: they sell insurance to old people &amp; process payment claims from doctors**\n\nClover sell two products:\n\n1. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which are just insurance plans for people on Medicare that include extra services along with the Medicare stuff, and\n2. Direct Contracting (DC) plans, which are one of several alternative payment models recently put forth by CMS (the people that run Medicare)\n\nThe important difference between these is that Medicare Advantage is an insurance plan where the ***patient*** is Clover's customer and Direct Contracting is where the ***doctor*** is Clover's customer. With the latter, Clover is acting as, essentially, a *payment processor* for the doctor's Medicare patients. This allows Clover to get a sweet slice of that government largess. On the doctors' side of it, they deal with Clover instead of CMS. Supposedly the whole scheme (and this is one of five put forth by CMS in 2020) is supposed to save the government money (&gt;!it won't!&lt;). I don't give a fuck about that part; all I care about here is whether Clover can grow their slice of the pie. \n\nThis Direct Contracting scheme was a ***major selling point*** for Chamath when they went public (more on that below), and for good reason. Clover only needs to manage a single relationship (with the doctor) to grab up dozens, or potentially hundreds, of patients. This DC scheme should be (*on paper at least)* far more efficient than Clover's original business model, which was just managing MA plans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Growth***\n\n* **TL;DR: they can** ***potentially*** \\~**25x their customer base** **^((but probably much, much less))**\n\nSo other than **\"the squeeze\"**, why would anyone ***genuinely*** believe this company is going to have some astronomical valuation that would give them a stock price on par with the likes of United Healthcare? Simple: growth. \n\nRight now Clover only services MA and DC contracts in a small number of counties: 108 in 8 states. They are expected to nearly double with an additional 101 counties by the end of the year, bringing the total to 209 in 9 states. Since there are 3,000 some odd counties in the United States, there is (*on paper*) a lot of room to expand here. **This is good**.\n\nAs of their latest earnings report, they had 128,591 \"lives under management.\" (I think that is a creepy as fuck way of putting it, but I *guess* it's industry standard....) Of those, 66,566 were MA customers and the remaining 62,025 were *indirect* patients, i.e., the Medicare patients of doctors in a DC agreement with Clover. The total of \\~129,000 was a year-over-year increase of 126.3%. **This is also good**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Math time!**\n\nIn their best counties, Clover has upward of 25% market share (at least this is their *claim*); that is, they have a quarter of the MA patients signed up with them. But to assume they can do that everywhere would be absurd. To keep this ultra simple, let's just assume that their current percentage as of the last earning report is representative of what they can do. So that is 128,591 \"lives\" across 108 counties which comes to an **average of 1,190 \"lives\" per county**.  (Obviously, not all counties are the same size, but let's just use this average for simplicity's sake.) So we have:\n\n**1,190 x 3000 = 3.57 million \"lives\"**\n\n**3,570,000 / 128,591 = 27.8**\n\nSo, ***theoretically***, Clover could achieve **27.8x growth** in customers, and ***presumably*** a similar growth in revenue. (We'll get to profitability, or lack there of, below.) Looking deeper at this number, one thing going for it is that the number of old people is steadily increasing. But on the other hand, competition is a thing, and big thing in this space. To assume that Clover is going to have 3.5 million customers in 10 years, or even 20, is pretty wild..... \n\nChamath claimed Clover was the \"easiest ten bagger\" he'd ever seen (or some shit like that). So, even going with that number, they would end up with 1.3 million \"lives\" in ten years. Even this seems pretty high to me. They went from 0 to 62,025 DC patients this year, but it is ***always easier to grow when you're small***. Scaling is an issue for all businesses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Profitability***\n\n* **TL;DR: they'll make no profit for a long ass time** **^((if ever))**\n\nAs for actually making money, well Clover doesn't do that. Yes, they had a 140% increase in revenue, which is good, but their expenses are rising ***faster*** than revenue. Accordingly, they missed on earnings by -0.52, or **378% downside surprise**. In typical corporate fashion, their forward guidance is full of claims of improvement on cost management just around the corner.\n\nThere is, to be fair here, a legitimate reason for some of the cost increases in the form of covid expenses. Essentially, some old people needed extra care, while others *delayed* care until it looked safe which caused a massive spike in trips to the doctor. And when you're old and you let shit slide, it gets a lot worse and a lot more expensive.\n\nFurthermore, their basic strategy involves eating losses when they take on new \"lives under management,\" with the idea that they'll make it back, and more, further down the road with that same patient though the efficiencies of their \"A.I.\", Clover Assistant.  \n\nTaking them at their word that this works (and will continue to do so at larger scales) then it is obvious they will being eating losses for years to come. Allegedly, they'll turn a profit in 2023, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that. However, just growing their \"lives under management\" number might be enough to hold up the stock price.\n\nIt might **not** be enough, however, to keep the lights on. If they can't at least slow the bleeding, share issuances could be lurking down the road (queue the pump &amp; dump conspiracies).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Competition***\n\n* **TL;DR: they have to take market share from better companies**\n\nAs noted above, the biggest hurdle in front of Clover is **competition**. Despite the \"tech start-up\" narrative surrounding Clover, the reality is that they are marching into the teeth of well-entrenched healthcare companies. \n\nThe likes of United Healthcare and Humana aren't going to take lightly to little ol' Clov rolling up in their shit. With about 10 million patients between them, UH and Humana are monsters in the Medicare space and with that comes the ability to undercut the competition. Furthermore, all these big players also have their own ***magic AI machine-learning gizmos*** that do ***magic AI things***. And they already have access to more data than Clover on account of their massive patient base. \n\nThis doesn't mean they can just snuff Clover out of existence, but taking away market share from established players is a far different gambit than expanding into a new market. And it gets harder the bigger you get. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Shaddy Shit***\n\n* **TL;DR: Chamath is a shaddy af, and so is the CEO**\n\nThis whole shabang was rolled out in typical Chamath fashion. Back in October of 2020, in his pitch for Clover, he claimed they **\"already\"** had 200,000 lives under management in their **Direct Contracting program** (i.e., not including the MA patients). Except that was bullshit of the Chamath-degree. At the time he claimed this, Clover ***hadn't even started*** its DC program (it had only just been accepted into the program). \n\nAs their latest earning report notes, they don't expect to get anymore \"lives\" in their DC program until Jan. 2022. (This is due to Medicare enrollment period rules). So, rather than \"already\" having 200,000 for 2021, Clover will instead end the year with the \\~62,000 that they have right now. ***Chamath at his finest, ladies and gentlemen.***\n\nClover's top guy, Vivek, is also well-known for being shaddy. Though, in his case, I don't actually care as much. Back in the day, this guy ran three hospitals in NJ that were noteworthy for having the highest fees of any hospitals in America. Shaddy, but shaddy in the ***ruthless capitalism direction***. He gets a pass from Cbass *for this*. He is also alleged to have pilfered a company he ran back in the day. This doesn't get a pass, because it could negatively affect my bottom line. \n\nClover is the subject of two ***related*** investigations, one from DoJ and the other from the SEC. The DoJ one is about shaddy business practices; something about kickbacks. I also don't give much a fuck about this. The SEC investigation is about the fact that the DoJ investigation was not disclosed during the SPAC merger. All this will probably amount to some fines, if anything at all. \n\nOn scale of 0 to Enron, I'll give Clover a 1.5. Doesn't look that bad to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Technology***\n\n* **TL;DR: they have a magic AI app that designed to maximize** **~~health~~** ***profits*** **^((maybe))**\n\nThe last thing to mention is the Great Green Hope: the **Clover Assistant**. This is the \"tech\" in Clover and the reason dipshits are using #TelsaHealth. What is it? Well, basically a data input and analysis program. More basically: *Microsoft Excel with fancy buttons*.\n\nClover Assistant is used by the doctors (and many MA patients use it, too) to coordinate and recommend stuff. The Great Hope here is that doctors love using this thing so much that they'll sign onto a DC agreement with Clover, allowing Clover to process their Medicare payment claims in exchange for access to the \"**app**\".\n\nSo is it going to work? Well, it is ***starting*** to: Clover went from 0 to 62,000 patients via this scheme this year. It's a country fucking mile from what Chamath claimed, but ain't nothing. And given the potential for expansion into the rest of the US, and you have the receipt for a pretty damn good return on capital. But then again, it is just an \"app\".\n\nTo be clear, I don't hate the *idea* of Clover Assistant. Conceptually, I actually like it. The Clover Assistant basically helps doctors make sure their patients are getting the \"right care\" by compiling data and presenting it in an easy to use fashion. This is presented as an opportunity to \"improve outcomes\" and \"save costs\" and \"help the under-served.\" But I don't give a rat's ass about any of that.\n\nWhich brings me to the Hindenburg report, and the part about it that I ***like***. The report claims that Clover is using the Assistant to direct doctors toward medical recommendations that would result in profits for Clover (rather than the best medical outcome), and that they are incentivizing the doctors with increased payments for these outcomes. ***I love this.*** Now, Clover vehemently denies this is the case, but I (not so) secretly hope their lying here, because this is ***exactly*** what I imagine when I think of applying Big Data-A.I. and Machine Learning to healthcare.   \n\nPeople have ***blind faith*** in machines, particularly ones that they've been told are \"**A.I. powered**\" and involve \"**machine learning**\". Thus, you can use the concept of \"A.I.\" to persuade patients to just accept whatever the computer tells them. Machine learning is then used program the Clover Assistant to ***maximize profits***, which should involve providing the minimum care required to keep the patient alive as long as possible. (Medicare pays a set amount to Clover and they get to keep the extra if the patients don't use up all the funds). \n\nThe only way I could see to improve on this diabolical scheme would be if they ground up the corpses of their newly deceased patients, turned them into food and fed them to the rest of their **\"lives under management.\"** I'm lookin' for every penny here, kids, ***every single penny***.\n\n[It's made from options traders!](https://preview.redd.it/u4qd8tzo63n71.jpg?width=780&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e27a86ed516acbd906706d2e9440056b6bd90d3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 3. A Conspiracy of Idiocy**\n\nTypical of any stock ticker that gathers a cultish following, the Clovidiots are as well-known for their conspiracy theories as they are for their options expiring worthless. Now, most of these are the run-of-mill shit you get with any ticker: the Hedgies, reeee! You would think that this is the first time some of these people had ever bought a stock... oh, wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Hedgies!!!***\n\n* **TL;DR: it's the stock market, deal with it**\n\nSo, do the \"Hedge Funds\" manipulate the stock price? Well, sure, why not. They definitely shorted it, and then managed to cover those short sales with little appreciable rise in the stock. Back in June, CLOV was at something like a 48% shorted. Now the it's 15% and I believe it got as low as 7% before this week's run up. While going from 48% to 7% short with no appreciable rise in the stock price looks impossible, it's definitely not when you considered that a large percentage of the float has been in institutional hands this whole time. Stock goes up a little, they sell and back down she goes, welcome to a regular day on the stock market.\n\nIs this some grand conspiracy of fat cats in a room smoking cigars as they plan out how to stick it to those pesky Reddit kids? ***I doubt it***, but if it makes you feel better, whatever.\n\nI, personally, would worry less about the \"Hedge Funds\" and more about the Market Makers, as they're the ones selling you the options, and if they buy up the stock beforehand, they can sell out for a profit while simultaneous vaporizing those call options you bought from them. In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the game.\n\nCan anything be done about it? Well, no, not really. At least, not unless retail buys up a larger percentage of the float. However, with each false run up, I wonder if that exact process is taking place, i.e., more bagholders are being newly minted, and each, not wanting to take an L and just move on with his life, decides to become a \"diamond handed ape.\" Only time will reveal the truth of this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Us vs. the World***\n\n* **TL;DR: everyone thinks this way, deal with it**\n\nThe second great conspiracy of CLOV is that the whole of the internet is out to get it. This is proffered with the full knowledge that GME-Anon and Popcorn ***both believe the same thing about their own stock.*** Both also believe that CLOV is, ***in and of itself***, a conspiracy to distract from their pet stock. But GME-Anon ***also believes*** that Popcorn is an engineered distraction. And all three are ***also*** convinced that the Mods are out to get them, ***specifically***.\n\nThis is, of course, perfectly normal behavior. That might seem shocking to some of you, but the next time you're watching football with a die hard fan (or whatever lame-ass europoor sport you watch), look for their reactions whenever the slightest thing doesn't go their way:\n\n* *\"These fucking refs are terrible! They're totally biased against my team! They've got it out for us! I'm going to write an angry letter to the league!\"*\n\nSound familiar? It should, because if you look around with open eyes, you'll find this exact behavioral pattern repeated at infinitum across every conceivable human endeavor.\n\nDo people hate CLOV and the masses of idiots holding it? Sure, and I don't blame them. You guys can be pretty fucking annoying. That does not, however, equate to a grand conspiracy of suppression. The fact that your copy-pasta DD got nixed just like everyone else's lazy dogshit copy-pasta is not you being singled out. It's you not understanding the rules and adapting your behavior to play within them. But hey, maybe it's easier to just blame the Mods.\n\n[\\(please don't ban me\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7mfo4sa0q3n71.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00e9a245357f31fe49b1cf093303f400f411d546)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 4. Rise now, a Man of the Bag Watch**\n\nHaving taken a brief tour of Castle Black and had a bit of a feel for what it's like to be a venerable Man of the Clov Bag Watch, most of you are probably thinking: *Okay, how the fuck do I get out this chickenshit operation?* \n\nWell, you are probably still hoping for **moon**. In that regard, I've some bad news for you: ***there will be no squeeze.*** \n\nThere will absolutely not be a **short squeeze****.** At 15% short, there is zero chance of this happening. *\"But, bruh, the* ***real*** *short number is like 420% bruh.\"* Bullshit. Just straight bullshit.\n\nThere is also not going to be a **gamma squeeze.** Not anytime soon, and likely never. In order to get a gamma squeeze you need options that are going to be delta-hedged. But why delta-hedge options that are going to be Thanos-snapped out of existence by expiry?\n\nA while back, it looked like there could be a **mixed squeeze** (short covering + gamma hedging), but that's all in the past now. Down the road from now, could it still happen? Yeah, sure, and I could end up raw-dogging a Victoria's Secret model on the hood of my new lambo. All kinds of crazy things are ***possible***, but that doesn't make them ***likely***.\n\nAnd honestly, what the fuck is wrong with a good ol' grind up? Squeezes are fun, I get it. You get to see your money double, triple, 5x, 10x, all in the space of a day or two. You get to see those option YOLO's gain a thousand of percent in minutes. But you still make money on a grind up. A fuckload of it.\n\nI'm not sure I buy into this whole notion of a \"squeeze\" being the **Holy Grail of the Stock Market**. It's starting to sound like the Bears and their perpetual claims that they're going to make ***all the money*** on the coming collapse, all while lighting round after round of SPY puts on fire. The Squeeze Fanatics are doing the same thing, but with call options on meme stocks. \n\nBut, hey, what do I know? I'm just peon in this operation, a pitifully small cog in the great meat grinder we call the stock market. For now the chart tells me there's still **hope of up**, and so my bag watch continues. When the chart dies and there is no more good to be said of the company, then I will initiate my Bagholder Optimization Formula and there my watch will end. Until then, I man my post.\n\n[Tormund Bearfucker](https://preview.redd.it/dpx4byfpy3n71.jpg?width=961&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55407f36e295ce5450fa607f21dfa766fc2f54c1)\n\n**Positions or Ban:**\n\n[Maybe I can try crtl-z?](https://preview.redd.it/w59n919dx3n71.jpg?width=1667&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a10ed3b8aee187ad77f3d03404586278d97e8c4)",

I have got lucky day trading on a few SPY puts/calls over the last couple months, but my losses outweigh my gains.

I made my biggest, non day-trade, options purchase Friday. (Big for me) I bought 10 Sep. 30 2021 460 calls at an average of .46 each. I think that specific option closed at .30 (Proof of position below) I feel OK about my entry, but what will I need to happen to make say 100% profit on it before expiration?

        "selftext": "Hey retards, \n\nso ending normal funnies and jokes- here\u2019s something that you all will need to understand and hopefully help you on your tax understanding. \n\nNow it won\u2019t be much fun to read it but knowing it may be helpful to you at some point.\n\n1) what is wash sale rule? \n\n&gt;A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar.\n\nNow the actual way to understanding this is kind of complex and even out of the scope of this post. You can be held at a tax higher than your gain (some retard got a 800k tax bill in a 40k gain because of wash sale rule since he was trading same stocks 10+ times a day). \n\nBut do know that this rule, is made to stop shady things. It usually won\u2019t effect you because brokerages are smart enough to realize it and do mathematical calculation to your second buy to fix the wash sale rule instantly. But there can be mistakes. \n\nNOTE: you should only be paying taxes on your actual gain and deducting from your all losses (total after net year). If anything is wrong, see tax accountant instantly. \n\n2)  tax-loss harvesting\n\nThis is like algebra math where you try to add and subtract to get the best number. Say you have 2 positions, one in AMD and one in GME. You realized a gain (so you closed your position) on AMD but still have your GME options chugging along. Your GME options don\u2019t expire until next year but they are in loss. It\u2019s December- so you say \u201cwait, rather than pay full tax on my gains from AMD, why don\u2019t I close my GME positions for a loss and now I can subtract that loss from my AMD gain and pay less tax\u201d. \n\n3) deduction of capital loss\n\nYou say you have -20k realized loss in 2020. You can deduct 3000$ from your earned income every year until that 20k is used up. This means you lost 20k in stocks but made 60k in your job- you can automatically deduct 3000 from your income so now you effectively have a 57,000$ income for tax. \n\nNow some people are confused but this is only for EARNED INCOME. The 3000 deduction limit is so it\u2019s not abused. But say you have 2021 capital gain from GME of 15k. \n\nHere if you still had -20k loss of 2020, you can deduct the full 15k gain from 2021 so that -20k loss now is at 5k loss and use the remaining 3000 from 5k to deduct the earned income (from job) of 2021. For a total net loss of -2k still left for next year. \n\n4) positions that you hold for less than 1 year will be taxed at higher % than positions held more than year. \n\nThere are more Things like Tax-optimized Portfolio and many other tax implication that are too far out of reach for a single post but be aware of all these things. \n\nSPY 460c 9/10- free money",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR Too much cash, not enough collateral.** \n\n**Disclaimer:** I am by no means an expert on this topic, I like to snort green crayons but recently have been getting into some reds, and therefore barely know wtf I'm talking about. I'm not arrogant enough to claim I know everything to do with this and won't pretend to. Do your own DD, come up with your own conclusions, and remember the economy always goes up until it doesn't. \n\nOutside of a few select stock subreddits that I shall not name here, not many people seem to be talking about Reverse Repos and their subsequent effect on the market. Let's fix that, shall we? \n\n**What are Overnight Reverse Repos (ONRRP)?** \n\nI'm not gonna bore the shit out of y'all with a bunch of technical jargon so I shall simplify it (and note: this is a *simplification* and therefore some nuance and detail is not included, so go fuck yourself if you feel the need to be an ass about something I didn't include.) \n\nReverse Repo's are basically an agreement between the Federal Reserve (which is *not* the same thing as the Federal government) and large financial institutions (banks, hedge funds, Market Makers, your wife's boyfriend, etc.) that basically boils down to the Fed giving these institutions a \"specified security\" (usually U.S. Treasury Bonds) in exchange for cash. Now, since the government is stingy with their T-Bonds and Financial institutions might need their money back at a moment's notice, these transactions are essentially reversed at the end of the day. \n\nThe Reverse Repo Program (Or RRP for short) is \"officially\" used to tighten the money supply. (Note how I said officially, I'll come back to that later.)\n\nNow, there is another program that is sometimes mentioned, called the Repo Program, which is basically the opposite of the Reverse Repo. It is used to \"inflate\" the money supply in the economy. I will not go into much more detail on this program since I have used my remaining few brain cells to understand Reverse Repos and not much else.\n\n**Cool, but, like, why?** \n\nSo to understand why this program is essential to \"control the money supply\" (aka Decrease Inflation), you have to understand one thing about these big financial institutions. \n\n**Cash = Bad**\n\nSeems counterintuitive, right?  Well, sort of. Basically, cash in itself is bad for these businesses because of one simple reason; Inflation. Cash is considered a liability (a risk) on their balance sheets when it's just sitting there not doing anything. Does the phrase \"Use money to make money\" ring a bell? Regardless, Institutions need to have most of their money in investments in order to not lose money and any opportunities to make money. \n\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about what exactly these bad boys have been doing for the last year and a half.\n\n**What the Fed doin'?**\n\nHere I'm going to lay out the facts of the matter and leave the speculation as to the why's further down in the next section. So, I hope y'all like pictures. \n\nStarting in March of this year, The RRP had begun to be used after nearly a year of nothing. This began after margin requirements for banks were reinstated in March after the Fed had significantly lowered them to help the economy after the COVID crash. \n\n*Processing img qandbr09xqk71...*\n\nIt has only increased since. \n\nNot only that, the *way* it has increased is rather unusual compared to the past. Up until around late 2018, the RRP market was used rather frequently but usually only during Quater ends. \n\n*Processing img lusi5amazil71...*\n\nSo this sharp increase with seemingly no correlation with Quarter ends has led to a lot of people smelling the bullshit so to speak. \n\n**1 Trilly Baby**\n\nSince August 11th, the RRP has been above 1 Trillion and has, as of August 31st, hit a high of 1.189 Trillion. The previous high before this year was around $474 billion in 2015, right at the end of Quater 4. \n\n**Why is this happening?** \n\nThe simple answer is that we don't know. Don't pull out the pitchforks quite yet, there are a few theories as to why just no concrete reason (as of yet) since none of the big boys want to reveal their hands. \n\n**Stock Market Crash**\n\nThe Stock Market has been reaching ATH's for the last few weeks and with the eviction moratorium ending, and possibly up to 11 million families at risk of losing their homes, there's a chance a crash is coming which may make 2008 look like peanuts in comparison. (MBS's anyone?)  *\"The last time this many families were behind on their mortgages was during the Great Recession.\" - CFPB* \n\nIn regards to this coming crash, it's possible that big investors are unwilling to risk putting more money into the market when they can rely on the government with their T-bonds. (Which also helps their margin requirements, so win-win for them.) I admit, this is pretty speculative and needs further research than what I'm willing to do right now.\n\n**Collateral Crisis** \n\nThere is some evidence that there is an actual shortage of Treasury bills within the market (dropping yields from their highs earlier this year) which could explain the Big Boys reliance on the FED and RRP. Oh, and the money printer himself, JPOW, said this, *\u201cYou could say there is a shortage of safe short assets\u2026 there\u2019s a shortage of T-bills\u201d*. So, yeah that's mildly concerning. \n\n**Short Positions**\n\nAnother reason as to the apparent need for bonds could be risky bets made by financial institutions (\"meme\" stocks anyone?) and the inevitability of short positions bankrupting them. I seriously doubt any of the big boys have closed most of their short positions yet so this is my personal theory. \n\nThere is also a chance that it's a combination of all three, none, or something else entirely that has yet to rear its ugly head. \n\n**TL;DR PT 2**\n\nThe point is; Reverse Repo's are a signal that the market is in risky shape due to unavoidable monetary policy decisions by the Fed (brought on by COVID) and Financial Institutions taking incredibly risky bets with other peoples' money. Time will tell what exactly caused this spike in Reverse Repo's but I'd hedge your bets whichever way you can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** GME \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**References:**  Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements: Treasury Securities Sold by the Federal Reserve in the Temporary Open Market Operations \\[RRPONTSYD\\], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD, September 3, 2021.  \n\n Lewis Huxley.

        "selftext": "Although everyone has sort've silently moved on, AMC is still trading steady at $45. (\\~500% gain from last year) GameStop is sitting steady at $200. (\\~2000% gain). Ethereum is growing rapidly and currently sitting at nearly $4000 (\\~2000% gain). The most popular NFT (CryptoPunks) have grown from $4000 last year to roughly $400,000.  That is a roughly 10,000% gain. I think you get the point.\n\n\"Value\" stocks like Ford and GM have gone up about 50% in the same time, a fraction of the growth stocks. Similarly, these value plays dropped 40% during the coronavirus crash, roughly the same as all risky assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. \n\nWhich poses the question :: why would anyone buy stocks, especially growth stocks?\n\nEverything Buffett and others eschew has essentially been thrown at the window. Now while one may have been focused on value and long term growth, their returns will have been essentially rooted to their peers who invested in growth. (ironic to call an unproductive asset like crypto \"growth\" but you get the point). So in logical times, you could say \"these are in a bubble and history does not repeat itself to the future.\" however, considering the past 5 years crypto is up tremendously with little dips and currently sits at a $900b mc (btc), it could also be another 5 years it goes to $2t before it goes back down. So \"the long run\" point is vague and meritless.\n\nInvesting has certainly changed from 100 years ago when Intelligent Investor was written, though obviously many of the principals still apply, how do you adapt?",

        "selftext": "Repost to fit subreddit criteria - sorry to keep in SPROTT, but their move affects everyone and it's hard to explain anything without including them.\n\nI'm sure it's not the first time you've come along Uranium, it appeared months ago and went with its success back to where it came from.\n\nEveryone involved in GME, AMC and anything else on here knows there are 3 things you need:\n\n1. A goal to act upon\n2. A support from media\n3. Big players outside of the general playingfield\n\nGME and AMC have received all 3 heavily. Due to the shorting beyond any reasonable means they were prime targets. This alone was enough for a decent price movement, but media enabled a global coverage of the topic which made so many more people aware of whats going on and flocking in. And lastly, many big names joined in, let it be for testing the waters or to join the fight. I'm sure you have a full list in your mind right now.\n\n**So what's with Uranium?**\n\nUranium is in a similar position and currently has the most aggressive movements in a company called **CCJ**, as well as ~~subreddit criteria~~. CCJ made it on the top 20 list of most bought options (in recent times) multiple times together with names of Tesla, Amazon etc.\n\nI'll explain the reason refered to as point 1, but I'll keep it short as it's the least impact of all. Without 2) and 3) not a lot would happen.\n\nSo in short, Uranium mines pretty much tuned down mining over the years due to demand but also because they are in a bad position. Most uranium buyers will only purchase short to mid term what they need instead of making contracts. Since these buyers exist in smaller amounts but with huge impact they can control what happens with the price, pretty much. So production went along with this and decreased to a minimum that can barely cover the needs and even slight interruptions that go on for a while would cause major issues.\n\nNow fast forward to the current date.\n\nThis is already 3) named Sprott.\n\nIf you don't know Sprott: \"Sprott is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets investing.\"\n\nWhat did they do? Well, don't take my word for it, let Bloomberg tell you what's going on:\n\n&gt;Sprott has amassed **over 24 million pounds** of uranium, sometimes buying more than 500,000 pounds in a single day, according to its website and social media account. For comparison, total spot volume for 2020 was 92.2 million pounds, according to uranium investor Yellow Cake Plc.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:\\~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/uranium-surges-to-six-year-high-as-fund-buys-up-physical-supply#:~:text=Sprott%20has%20amassed%20over%2024,uranium%20investor%20Yellow%20Cake%20Plc).\n\nThe expectation here is not a short squeeze as of now. The main expectation is an insane surge in price due to the tight demand-supply that was floating around Uranium and is now majorly interrupted. With how tight it is Sprott can pretty much control the price to an extend and that's why it's going crazy.\n\n**So what's with media support?**\n\n[**https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html**](https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html)\n\nWell, you are free to look for yourself, but it started and is as expected. The move of them is hyped up like crazy and this has by far not over at all. The initial price surge came from the news of them buying and announcing it, for a reference:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSPROTT announces their purchase program of Uranium\n\nThe media coverage is there and it's just starting off. If you search for Uranium and go 1 month, 1 wekk and 1 day back on the Google search you'll see an exponential increase in articles despite the way less time a single day has compared to an entire week.\n\n**But what's the future of Uranium?**\n\nI can't tell you what happens, if that was the case I'd be rich, sitting on a bought island and slurping cocktails 24/7. But this move caused by a company, not by a random action or idea - so it's their own interest to make the most out of it and considering what they just caused they are most certainly no idiots. The first impact is the announcement and what people understand will follow: A lack of supply. So why shouldn't mines just produce more? They sold a ton to SPROTT and could now satisfy the lack of product, right? Well, not really. If they do this, SPROTT will most likely decline or stop buying more, meaning their bumped up production is completely wasted for a one time pay off that might not even be good for them. But wait, it gets worse - for the Uranium buyers. A ton of nuclear power stations are opening. Nuclear Power is pretty much green energy with a bad side effect of radioactivity, but that's why it was pushed more and more. It's by far better for the environment than coal, which countries move away from - at least if they care about the environment.\n\nSo combined: Miners will most likely not increase production because they would shoot into their own foot (their ultimate goal is longterm well paying contracts), demand for Uranium will surge up in the next months and years and SPROTT doesn't stop buying current production. No matter what happens the price will keep surging since SPROTT can pretty much set the price they want, but in a likely case this might spiral to levels that we had back in 2011 with 70-80$ or heck even 140$ in 2007. Mind you a big move away from Nuclear Power Plants happened a while ago and with the new found hype for Uranium and the given issues this could become bigger than ever before.\n\n**So what do I do if I want to join?**\n\nAs mentioned you can either buy CCJ or the ~~subreddit criteria~~. All 3 are well performing among this surge. Don't get me wrong, all Uranium stocks have surged like crazy recently, but most options trading happens in CCJ while the ~~subreddit criteria~~ cover all the Uranium companies, making it a safer play though also covering the potential losers or low risers.\n\nNo financial advise of course, just sharing what my dummy brain was able to gather.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve refrained from writing a post here on my position in ASO for a while because I don\u2019t want to peddle my shit  and turn this thing into a meme stock (or do i) but I feel like I\u2019d be doing a disservice to my fellow retards by not sharing a major value story here with y\u2019all. GME made me more money than I've ever had, so I hope this can do something like that for some of yall, truly. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nQuick Pitch\n\nASO is at a P/E ratio of 6.6 -7, with revenue $6+ billion, increasing margins and more profitable than ever, amarket cap of only $3.5b and their debt load being dramatically reduced ahead of schedule. Heavily owned by institutions, KKR dramatically reducing their majority shareholder % to now only 20%. A share repurchase program for $500mil and a lot of insider buying and Ken Hicks who turned Footlocker around took their share price straight up\u2026. How and why are people you guys not buying this up? This 6% dip this morning is probably the best value you can get on the market. Its pretty much an anomaly in today\u2019s market climate. \n\nDKS (Dicks sporting goods) PE ratio is at a 11/12. If ASO was adjusted to just a PE of 9 they would be somewhere around $58.00 a share which is a 45% increase from where we are at today. 9 is extremely fair. As the best and most efficient retailor in the market they should be a 15 or $85 a share. \n\nASO, Academy Sports and Outdoors, is massively undervalued compared to its peers and it is the best player in the space. Why aren\u2019t retail investors piling into this for locked  gains has me confused? It\u2019s a real company with real customers that are loyal and lifers of Academy, many have been shopping there since they were kids and now it\u2019s where they shop for their kids.  My guess is investors see Covid days as good as it\u2019s going to get for Academy, but the reopening is proving to be even bigger and permanent than expected.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIt\u2019s important to know where Academy stores are located and who they serve. Academy has 259 mostly in the Southeast. They are a low/mid cost sports and outdoors retailer. Think youth sports, gym clothes, and camping/fishing /hunting gear. Their stores are often the only specialty retailer in a suburban area and some more heavily populated areas where ASO and Dicks compete (and in those area ASO wins every time). Their customers tend to be more blue-collar simpler consumers who would rather touch and feel the products vs order online for convenience, even though online sales have picked up drastically recently. Not having a strong online presence is not something that should turn you away from this stock. Nobody buys fishing equipment, camping gear, your child\u2019s sports equipment online, these are things you want to touch and feel and try on and especially with this crowd of consumers.\n\nLike I said I think investors look at covid lockdowns as if it were ASO\u2019s best days, in fact I think this is why KKR ultimately decided to take them public after seeing 2 monster quarters back-to-back, they knew their valuation would be higher than it\u2019s ever been and thought better take advantage of this fluke. I believe retailers are valued at IPO on their previous 2 quarters. But they didn\u2019t expect to keep having monster record earnings afterwards so turns out they jumped the gun. Here\u2019s why it will continue at least for a couple more quarters. Q2 last year we were completely shut down, sure exercise equipment and bike sales were through the roof, but youth sports and other sections came to a screeching halt. Now you have a massive reopening trade that will last a couple quarters longer as kids get back to each of their respective sports (each season) after a year hiatus and adults get back to their hobbies. Kids grow fast and I\u2019m predicting this sector of the business will be on fire for a bit as parents have to replace outgrown equipment. This should bring more traffic to their stores than ever Academy is doing well and will continue to do well because they have a massive loyal following in the South with a product mix that\u2019s borderline recession proof and mostly resilient to online retailers. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nComps\n\n21\u2019 Guidance compared to 19\u2019 Pre-Covid\n\n\\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $120,000,000 in 2019\u2013 increase of 352%\n\n\\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from $4.8B in 2019 \u2013 increase of 35% \n\n\\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $1.60 \u2013 increase of 252%\n\n21\u2019 guidance compared to 20\u2019 numbers (keep in mind 20\u2019 was thought to be their record fluke sales year)\n\n\\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $309,000,000 in 2020 \u2013 increase of 76%\n\n\\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from 5.689B in 2020 \u2013 increase of 15%\n\n\\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $3.79 in 2020 \u2013 increase of 48%\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOther bullish indicators\n\n\\-  Gross margin increased 29.4% to $642.5 million, the highest quarterly gross profit in the Company's history. The gross margin rate improved by 500 basis points to 35.9%. This growth was primarily driven by stronger merchandise margins from a favorable product mix shift, higher average unit retails and less promotional activity.\n\n\\-  The company also took steps to enhance its balance sheet. As of the end of the second quarter, the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled $553.8 million with no outstanding balance on its credit facility. Adjusted free cash flow was $169.5 million. Merchandise inventories were $1.1 billion, an increase of 24.0% compared to the prior year quarter and 3.2% compared to Q1 2021.\n\n\\-  Academy's largest shareholder (KKR) completed two transactions, reducing their ownership to approximately 20% of the Company as of the end of the quarter.\n\n\\-  As part of one of these events, Academy purchased and retired 3.2 million shares for approximately $100 million.\n\n\\-  In addition to the stock repurchase, the Company paid down $99 million of its outstanding term loan and refinanced the loan's interest rate from LIBOR + 5.0% to LIBOR + 3.75%. Based on these positive actions, S&amp;P (B+ from B) and Moody's (Ba3 from B1) both upgraded the Company's debt rating.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIm long 6,350 shares at $37.30 basis. \n\nI'll let others talk about the Short Interest attached to ASO and any potential squeezes. I think its a buy  with easy 50-100% upside regardless of any of that. That would all be bonus. But if this thing does move to $50-$55 quickly it could really trap some of the shorts and gap up pretty quickly. \n\nPlease take advantage of this and stop buying Discord pump and dumps.",

        "selftext": "IRNT is currently trading similar to AMC (which traded similar to GME) as it approached it's gamma squeeze. 05/27 AMC had a post market jump which led to another jump in premarket the following day (like 09/03 on IRNT although IRNT's jump is a bit exaggerated by the low float). The upward momentum wasn't held and the stock tumbled intraday creating a downward ramp pattern on 05/28 (like 09/07 on IRNT). This led a gap up (which IRNT did not mirror likely just due to market conditions) into a loose \"cup and handle\" on 06/01 (like IRNT today).  \n\n\nI think we all know what happened on 06/02 with AMC.  \n\n\nWith IRNT ringing the opening bell tomorrow at the NYSE, there may be the catalyst to set off the powder keg as technicals line up with another run (double bottom rejection on $16.75) and research shows that opening bell rings on newly debuting NYSE stocks bring \"abnormal buy volume\". The first \"bullish\" day into the $20's is the exact setup needed to get through the ramp and establish the \"GME style\" launch the following day that AMC didn't have due to the share offering(s).  \n\n\nNot a guarantee, but it's something to watch tomorrow.

        "selftext": "Your pal Squirrely over here, providing some insights into the meta world of SPAC investing. This is a follow up to my previous post about [SPAC price discovery that you can review here](https://new.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/oaf2pq/why_price_discovery_is_broken_in_the_spac_market/).\n\nSo what's do I think is on the near and longer term horizon in SPAC Land?\n\n**1.Warrant Gang**\n\nWith most SPACs trading below $10, \"cheap warrants\" have held their value incredibly well. This is still one of the most mispriced and misunderstood securities in the SPAC market - [especially by retail traders](https://new.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/owf9ah/lcidcciv_s1registration_filed_swap_your_shares/). What's going to be more interesting is that at least one of these SPAC warrants are going to trigger their Crescent Term in the next 3-12 months (What's a crescent term? it's the thing that most of you don't know about and it's the primary reason why many warrants hold value as commons drill down to $4).\n\nOn the flipside, for SPACS doing well, warrants will be [continually called for redemption](https://new.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/pg8uk7/please_peter_dont_call_in_the_lcid_warrants_until/hbg88yc/?context=3) (either on a cash or cashless basis). What we haven't seen much (or any) of, is the $10-$18 cashless redemption. It's going to be a shock to some people when a common is trading for $12.50 and suddenly the warrants get redeemed into 0.283 shares of stock. That being said, many of the warrants in this range are trading near or below their cashless conversion prices so this will generally provide upside. I'm writing this because there will invariably dozens of \"I didn't know this could even happen posts\".\n\nThe **PSA I keep shouting from the rooftops**: Warrants are incredibly complicated securities, not \"basically cheap 5 year leaps\", and you need to read the S1's and warrant agreements and know each one inside out. There isn't even reliable sources of information for warrants (expiration date is often wrong in Bloomberg), and I've had to have my lawyers email CFO's because their own S1/warrant docs directly contradict each other.\n\nLast thought on warrants is that the latest batch of 13F's are very useful to understand if you're on the same side as \"Smart Money\". Recall that institutions are given warrants for free as sweeteners to participate in SPAC IPOs. Naturally they're on the \"selling side\" of warrant transactions as they try to liquidate them. If you see net institutional buying (i.e. Q2 13F's show more institutions buying vs selling warrants, or even near equal amounts), it's a sign that some professionals have looked into the company and like it for some reason. TWCT (now CLBT) is [a good example of this](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/twctw) where there were 7m+ warrants acquired, and less than 3m sold.\n\n**2. Squeeze/Momentum Gang**\n\nIt's been fun, it really has, but we're deep into the 9th inning of this game. The issue with this strategy is that it's a game of implicit collusion. Everyone needs to \"hold the line\", and as more and more people crowd into the trade, everyone tries to front-run each other and sell sooner. It's an unstable equilibrium, and contrary to popular belief (the more people jumping in, the higher open interest on the options, means the bigger the stock will move up), it's actually quite the opposite. There's a \"goldilocks range\" of having enough participants to push the stock up, and simultaneously hold the stock without dumping early. Also the options market makers (Citadel, Jane Street, etc.) are way smarter than retail traders, with bigger balance sheets, and don't delta-hedge their short options positions anymore because they know they just need a $300m buffer to wait out the squeeze and collect the $10m of options premiums they wrote. \"There's soo much gamma, why didn't it SQUOZE?!?\"\n\nThis works better with GME and AMC because there's no hard deadline of when the game will end. Also, a large contingent of GME/AMC holders are not financially motivated (certainly not in the short run) and are just owning shares for entertainment value. With SPACs, everyone knows that these moves will get crushed by the PIPE unlock that is day/weeks away. Everyone is in it, just make a quick profit. Its mathematically impossible for everyone to make a quick profit. I have all the respect for people who are playing this game at a sophisticated level, but I will continually stress to newcomers to stay away (easiest way to know if you're a fox or a sheep is whether you're writing or reading the squeeze DD). I will also note that I was the first person in recent history to [post about this type of trade](https://new.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/ola0rw/a_curious_situation_for_sbgs_owlt_float_after_86/), but specifically avoided using cheerleading language because, shockingly, I wasn't trying to get everyone to jump in and buy my bags. I just wanted to document it so I could refer to it now.\n\n**3. Pipe Unlock Gang**\n\nThis is, and will continually be, a valid trade despite it becoming popularized by the LCID + JOBY one-two punch that happened a couple weeks ago. The more obscure trade that will catch people off guard is the sponsor promote unlock that typically comes 150-180 days after despac, and those trades will really start to take shape in the next couple months. Sponsors are highly motivated to liquidate their shares so you'll see 3-5m shares smash the market on the unlock date.\n\n**4. Investment Gang**\n\nI'm still convinced that we won't see a meaningful \"retail bid\" in SPACs, probably ever. So the game that I referred to in my last post is to figure out what institutional investors will be buying in the next 3-12 months.\n\nI generally put SPACS into three buckets, pre-revenue hard tech, early revenue growth, and developed companies. Lets break each one down:\n\nPre-Revenue Hard Tech\n\nI hate this sector, and think it's an awful place to be. These are the Quantumscape-type companies that are still in heavy R&amp;D and aren't expected to generate a dollar of revenue for 2-5 years. These companies historically raised private money from late-stage Venture/Growth companies. Before doing a $300m funding round, these VCs would do insanely extensive technical diligence to really dive into the technology and understand whether they wanted to back the company's R&amp;D teams. As a retail investor, you cannot get a remote grasp on who good their technical development is. Public institutional investors (large funds that buy common stocks) also largely can't do this. Information asymmetry is extremely high, and in favor of management who is absolutely lying in their investor presentations. I'm not saying all of these companies are frauds or are going to fail, I'm just saying that it's nearly impossible for a retail investor to have an \"edge\" in figuring out which of these companies are more (or less) legit.\n\nThere isn't much of an institutional bid for these companies, so I'd be staying away from them. These companies do have meme-value so if that's what you're chasing, best of luck.\n\nEarly-Revenue Growth\n\nThese are companies that have achieved product-market fit and are starting their hockey-stick revenue (and presumably stock price) trajectory. Think SRNG(DNA) or VACQ(RKLB) type companies. The biggest mistake I see retail investors making here is complaining about high multiples. Multiples are entirely irrelevant in these businesses. There are two things to be looking for in these businesses: contract wins and institutional stock promotion. \n\nContract wins provide a strong signal that the technology being sold works, because potential customers have access to far more technical information (and have the ability to digest it) better than any category of investors. I don't care if you have a PhD in aeronautical propulsion, RKLB's deal with Kineis yesterday is a far stronger signal than your 10 page DD. Also while we're on that topic, incremental contract wins are far more important than existing ones, because contracts/deals are often long term and having customers \"stuck\" in a long term deal does not imply the company is doing well. Also, contract win/partnerships for existing commercialized tech, is far more important than early-stage R&amp;D partnerships (Volkswagen with Quantumscape, Toyota with Joby, etc.)\n\nInstitutional funds are hungry for growth stories where they can actually see the growth on a quarter-by-quarter basis (unlike the group of companies above). These fund managers are busy and they aren't clicking on reddit DD's wondering what they should buy next. They're golfing at conferences and listening to the CEO/CFO pitch directly to them and providing one on one facetime (or virtual conferences these days, which are far less effective but better than nothing).\n\nWall Street analysts also have a balance sheet, income statement and statement of cashflows that they can work off of to put together a reasonably sensible forecast. The sales teams at the banks can then make calls to promote the stock to institutional buyers and use the research reports/price targets to back up their sales pitches.\n\nThese companies will have a reasonable institutional bid and I expect them to do well. The biggest red flag is that a fair number of companies fall in this bucket but aren't spending time promoting themselves at the institutional level, or making PR announcements about their business developments, or getting sell-side research coverage.\n\nDeveloped Companies\n\nThis is finally where comps and multiples start to matter and make sense. These companies have developed revenue streams and are often profitable, or cashflow (EBITDA) positive. We're talking about companies like BFT(PSFE) or TWCT(CLBT). Note that just because a company is developed, doesn't mean that it doesn't have room for explosive growth (i.e. PSFE with igaming, etc.)\n\nI think this is the easiest bucket to make money with because quantitative algorithms love these types of companies and it's easiest to predict their behaviors. Funds will allocate to the companies blindly (regardless of the company's promotional abilities or sell side research). These companies also have pretty strong floors in place because they aren't incinerating cash, and have extensive operations that have value to a strategic buyer (i.e. BARK has a hard floor of about $5).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nObviously I've presented three generalized buckets here and companies fall into a spectrum of the categories. Most importantly I wanted to shed light on some ways to think about some of these companies which will hopefully give people more analytical perspective. I will stress that stock appeal is relative, and many people fall in love with a single stock/story without looking at others. You need to critically look at many stocks, attempt to objectively score them on some of the attributes I've mentioned above, then build a portfolio of them and weight that portfolio based on their relative appeal (spoiler: a portfolio of one stock isn't a portfolio). People always joke about bagholding awful stocks from months past- sell them at a loss and move on with your life. Or sell them, wait 30 days, then decide if you want to buy back in 30 days later. Your mind will be far more objective.\n\nWith my posts, I inevitably get the \"so where's the list of tickers?\" question, and I think that's not that different than saying \"tits or gtfo\". 1) I don't share most of my positions because I don't like giving away my alpha. 2) I'm not trying to unload my bags and don't want it to be construed as such 3) I'm an educator and want to help people learn how to analyze investments and strategies versus blindly follow other people's recommendations.\n\nThanks for reading, hopefully you found a few tidbits of knowledge here. Happy investing to all.",

The identities of the committee members, who are full-time staffers at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, are kept anonymous.\n\n\u201cEntrance to the S&amp;P 500 is a combination of both art and science,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-stocks-possible-return-to-s-p-500-in-hands-of-anonymous-committee-11630494001?mod=hp\\_lead\\_pos4](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-stocks-possible-return-to-s-p-500-in-hands-of-anonymous-committee-11630494001?mod=hp_lead_pos4)",

        "selftext": "The basics:\n\nAs a pre-cursor - This post is not intended to be too much about the fundamental basics of the company. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pmaxlb/auph_best_treatment_against_lupus_nephritis_still/) was posted here and did a pretty good job of that. Basically, they have a new standard of care drug that is saving lives in a rare disease. \n\nAlso, I am not a financial advisor, yada yada, this is not financial advice, yada yada standard disclaimer.\n\nNow that you\u2019re current if you read the link, let\u2019s get this thing going.\n\nAurinia is in a very special spot right now. As many of you may know, we are headed into triple witching week (simply put, the expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options all fall on the same day), this only happens four times a year and makes stocks very volatile.\n\nWhy does this make Auph special? While, for this week alone [Auph already has 27k options that are ITM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AUPH/options?date=1631836800&amp;p=AUPH), if you include the [October calls, its 68k options ITM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AUPH/options?date=1634256000&amp;p=AUPH). \n\nWhat's really important is when you notice that they are on the precipice of $20. As they cross $20, another 25.5k options come into the money. At $25 another 33k options come into the money from both September and October. Most stocks, especially Auph, do not attract this much out of the money buying volume, especially one week until expiration. \n\nSo what happened?\n\nUsually, you can look at this and assume a whale or someone leaked something and a move higher is coming. Many figure this is the case as 2 weeks back, a bit over 40k call options were purchased in 2 days. Why? Possibly because for multiple reasons there is speculation a buyout is coming ([pr about a buyout resulting in firings](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/21/08/22676683/aurinia-pharma-shares-up-3-7-following-earlier-press-release-from-co-disclosing-it-entered-deal-to-b), delisting from tsx, and multiple articles whisperings for months in reputable newspapers about buyout negotiations).\n\nThat all being said, this puts the stock in a special spot. [**Referencing this post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)**, on the basics of how a gamma squeeze works,** if auph crosses 20$ on Monday morning, it should begin a gamma ramp. This process creates a runaway effect when the next set of available options also has a large OI. For example, as Auph crosses $20, MMs begin to cover their calls more aggressively as they begin to come into the money, meaning they will buy more shares. As they buy more shares, the stock price will raise, as the stock price raises, they will need to buy more shares. This is compounded especially when the next option has a large OI. With the massive OI on both September and October $20 and $25 calls, a gamma squeeze would be huge and could possibly even put the $25s in the money by the end of the week.\n\nAs a precursor to all of this, I rode GME, from 10 to 400 ( go back and check [my comment history](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/gfbe9hx?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if you don\u2019t believe me). No one really talks about it, but it was a gamma squeeze before it was a short squeeze. Auph, while not GME sits in a similar position. Over the past month during their run. They have not seen even a 1% change in short interest (current short interest is 17% of float). So after a gamma squeeze, there very well could still exist a chance for a short squeeze.\u00a0\n\n**TLDR:** Due to a massive option OI, Aurinia is ripe for a gamma squeeze **sending it much higher**. If it crosses 20, it could easily see 25. If it crosses 25, it will likely keep a runaway effect.\n\n**As a last note:** \n\nAll of this becomes moot if Aurinia is bought out before Monday morning or before calls expire at the end of the week. At this point, I would highly suggest looking to the XBI, and strong biotech tickers like MYOV (Shameless plug, but is currently undergoing a share buying program from the main owner that took it from about 20 to 27 and is only halfway complete, has a deal with PFE for $4.2b, and 3 standard of care approved indications), as well as some other strong biotech stocks that stand potential to surge in the case of AUPH money flowing to other tickers after a buyout (This happened after $TRIL buyout as well).  \n\nMy positions: \n\nAuph: 0 shares, 260 calls. September $20, $25, and $30. October $20 and $25.\n\nMyov: 22,500 shares. 210 calls, spread dates and strikes. Mostly ITM.",

        "selftext": "# GME has a negative beta.  \n\nFor those that don't know, this means that the stock moves opposite of the direction from the overall market.  So, if the overall market is going up, GME should be going down and vice versa.  Not only is this kind of thing **rare to see**, but the significance of it with GME fits the theory that the stock is outrageously short.\n\n# So, why is this important? \n\nThere is an expected taper to happen from the Federal Reserve soon.  Although specifics weren't mentioned, it has been rumored a 1-2% taper will happen which, should this happen, the markets will drop significantly.  If the taper is truly 1-2% without accounting for panic selling, the likely drop could be anywhere between 4-6% (overall).  This with the eventual contraction of monetary policy (which is much closer to us than we think) should cause the overall market to drop significantly as well.\n\nAssuming things play out like this, GME's negative beta at -2.0 should mean it would increase at the rate the overall market drops and those short on GME will likely be squeezed out which, as a result, will force **massive levels of liquidation** on other securities to cover their short positions (naked as well) furthering negative movement for the overall market.\n\n# GME's Beta vs Normal Stocks\n\nBeta is a pretty accurate tool and for most stocks unafflicted by this form of manipulation, the relationship between the overall market's movement and the unafflicted stock's movement is crystal clear.  Not only is a negative beta rare to see, but **it's inconsistency with the overall market is equally rare too**.  In essence, it shows manipulation is happening because there are bouts where GME actually moves with the market despite having a negative beta.  I'm not talking about small dips or gains eithers, I'm talking about the overall picture, where we've seen SPY hit 450 and GME has been all over the place, yet, it's negative beta stands.\n\nI don't have an immediate answer for this, but what we do know is that ETF's play a large role with those shorting meme stocks.  Same with options and thus, when we see GME move inconsistent with it's beta, what we're actually seeing is manipulation take place.  \n\nTLDR\n\n* GME has a negative beta which suggests that the stock moves opposite of the overall market.\n* The Feds' taper and eventual contraction of monetary policy will cause the markets to drop significantly, which will likely the catalyst for shorts to be squeezed out.\n* GME has a negative beta because of short positions taken on it.  Whenever shorts become squeezed out of their positions, massive levels of liquidation on other securities will happen to cover their short position which, as a result, should drop the overall market.\n* The rate of GME's increase will likely be the rate of decrease for the overall market.\n* GME's beta is not only extremely rare to see, but the extreme inconsistencies of it's movement is equally rare.  This alone shows that manipulation is taking place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-powell-weighs-delta-risk-gives-no-signal-start-bond-buying-taper-2021-08-27/](https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-powell-weighs-delta-risk-gives-no-signal-start-bond-buying-taper-2021-08-27/)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow are two examples of when GME's beta reflects accurate movement.

        "selftext": "TLDR: Generally CBOE requires a minimum float of 7M shares to have options listed on a ticker. IRNT was formerly a SPAC (DFNS) that had options listed, but after the acquisition 90% of shares were redeemed. We're left with a ticker with ~2.7M shares floated and with whale-built OI and retail catching wind. **Gamma is the highest I've seen on any ticker, and a substantial amount of float is likely tied up deltahedging.** Credentials: I look at gamma ramps all the fucking time. Action today was from a tiny sliver of retail, it's stabilized, and I'm buying lotto tickets in case something bigger is in store.\n\n# 0. Summary\n\nThis is a play I fortunately picked up from [an esteemed redditor's profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/Undercover_in_SF/comments/pg3s2e/). It has flown under the radar (until yesterday), and just recently (today) the Market Cap of $1.61b was [published on MarketWatch](https://marketwatch.com/investing/stock/irnt), making it eligible for that sweet, mindless, retail pile on that we all know so well.\n\nTo be clear, this is a gamma squeeze play. Yes, I know, squeezes are gay. However, they've [treated me quite nicely in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvp67v/rkt_compelling_options_chain_1b_buyback_great/) and I don't mind gambling on another. **This easily has the best set-up for a gamma squeeze that I've seen.** I look at gamma ramp charts every day for all types of tickers I come across, and I've never seen anything this extreme before. (I have a screener for \"interesting gamma ramps\" but this slipped by due to having an unknown market cap, because I scrape from Yahoo Finance and Marketwatch and not from analyzing filings and doing math.)\n\nThis is a bet that the catalyst that whale(s) are betting on is realized, and/or that retail piles on, and that MMs deltahedging will multiply the effects of either of those.\n\nYes, today it already peaked. I don't even know what the catalyst for that was, but I don't think this is fully on retail's radar yet and believe there's a lot more demand coming.\n\n\n# 1. The Set-up\n\n## August (Phase 1)\n\nAs explained (much better) in [the original DD](https://www.reddit.com/user/Undercover_in_SF/comments/pg3s2e/), this was a SPAC. Pre-acquisition, the SPAC had enough float/marketcap/whatever for CBOE to list some options on it.\n\nThen, the SPAC went forth with the acquisition and redeemed 90% of the god damn float. Normally a stock with this low amount of float would not be allowed to have options listed -- but since it was already listed, what could they do?\n\nNext, a whale entered. Extremely bullish calls purchased resulting in a pre-built gamma ramp and also tying up an (approximated) 40% of the remaining float. (This value is obviously not accurate, but compared to other tickers also-inaccurate figures, it is very high. More on that later.)\n\nWhat was left was a stock with *extremely low float*, and *a whale-built gamma ramp*.\n\n## Yesterday (Phase 2)\n\nYesterday an esteemed redditor put together these pieces and [posted a DD to their own profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/Undercover_in_SF/comments/pg3s2e/), as no other sub-reddits would have them.\n\nThis lead to some relatively light (by WSB standards) options activity on it midday. The price jolted up 10% as a result. This is from a single DD on a user's profile that was crosslinked to a couple of small sub-reddits.\n\nIn total, probably about 150 upvotes worth of eyeballs were on it... and as a result it moved 10% up in a matter of hours.\n\nTo me, this proves that this stock is highly reflexive to inflows of options/shares, has a compelling DD behind it, and that I want lotto tickets in case there's any catalyst whatsoever, including retail FOMO.\n\n## Today (Phase 3)\n\nEarly in the day there was some inflow, gamma took off, and this thing was halted. It spiked up and immediately came crashing down. IVs got jacked up to the roof but have now stabilized to somewhat sensible levels. The stock remains up 15% for the day.. indicating to me this thing is not done yet.\n\n**Also today, Market Watch now shows the market cap ($1.14b), making this stock eligible for the big leagues; right here.** That's phase 3. Mainstream.\n\nWhat we now have is a stock with *extremely low float*, a whale-built gamma ramp, proof that small retail buy-in can drastically effect the price, and visibility on WSB.\n\n## Catalyst\n\nHigh gamma doesn't mean shit without a catalyst.

It's an approximation, because it makes the following (incorrect) assumptions:\n\n1. All options on the chain are delta hedged against...\n2. via black-scholes model using the implied vol...\n3. continuously.\n\nNone of these are likely to be true. However, the chart is useful for comparing against other tickers and other scenarios. In other words, the extent that the delta/gamma values are inexact are probably similar across tickers.\n\n**The values for IRNT are far beyond anything I've seen before.** When GME/RKT had their gamma squeezes, the gamma (which I measure as how many shares need to be delta hedged per a 1% price move) was around 1.00% of float.\n\nThe values for IRNT are &gt;1.50% of float all the way out to $22.00/sh -- peaking at 2.71%. Fucking insane.\n\nThis means that if the share price moves 1%, MMs will (in theory) need to buy a *shit ton* of shares to remain delta neutral.  Will they do this?  Yesterdays price action seems to indicate as much. An inflow of options activity cause the price to jump up 10%, and this was only from a few very low-visibility posts around reddit, totaling maying 200 upvotes.\n\nAnother value, *net delta*, is extremely high already. About 95% of the remaining float is held by MMs to remain delta neutral (again, in theory, and an approximation). This is about the levels that GME/RKT were prior to them mooning. They were actually a bit less. And, again, this is not a precise estimate -- but qualitatively compared to all the ramps I look at, it's *very* high up there.\n\nNow, for reference, here is GME's current gamma ramp:\n\n## GME\n\n**Weighted Avg IV:** 144.07%, **Shares:** 76,820,000, **Float:** 63,170,000, **Avg Vol (10d):** 6,456,600  \n\nTheo Price|Net Delta|\u2190 % Float|Gamma (1% Price \u2206flux)|\u2190 % Float / % Avg Vol|24hr \u2206flux (sh)|\u2190 % Float / % Vol\n--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:\n$100.00|-6,769,015|-10.72|93,770|0.15 / 1.45|-31,000|-0.05 / -0.48\n$125.00|-4,393,696|-6.96|122,974|0.19 / 1.90|-72,568|-0.11 / -1.12\n$150.00|-1,648,345|-2.61|177,272|0.28 / 2.75|-62,554|-0.10 / -0.97\n$175.00|1,389,873|2.20|218,084|0.35 / 3.38|-71,414|-0.11 / -1.11\n**c - $200.00**|4,839,627|7.66|324,071|0.51 / 5.02|31,102|0.05 / 0.48\n**o - $213.52**|6,797,252|10.76|280,339|0.44 / 4.34|-65,204|-0.10 / -1.01\n$225.00|8,236,762|13.04|264,647|0.42 / 4.10|-110,516|-0.17 / -1.71\n$250.00|10,776,180|17.06|262,086|0.41 / 4.06|-276,179|-0.44 / -4.28\n$275.00|12,904,238|20.43|197,586|0.31 / 3.06|-87,874|-0.14 / -1.36\n$300.00|14,795,709|23.42|278,820|0.44 / 4.32|-386,489|-0.61 / -5.99\n$325.00|16,438,090|26.02|178,717|0.28 / 2.77|-101,881|-0.16 / -1.58\n$350.00|17,734,827|28.07|172,775|0.27 / 2.68|-152,755|-0.24 / -2.37\n\nGME peaking at 0.50% float per 1% price move.

Currently 11% of float deltahedged.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI've never seen a ticker with this much gamma. I'm still in.\n\n# 3. How Does This Play Out?\n\nA gamma ramp by itself only indicates that the stock can move with extreme volatility in regions where gamma is high. This is due to MMs \"mirroring\" inflows/outflows to delta hedge. Stock goes up, they buy more. Stock goes down, they sell more. For IRNT, the regions of high gamma are basically *any price*, since the float is so damn low and the OI is so high.\n\nWhat is needed for a gamma squeeze to occur is an actual catalyst. MMs need to be forced to deltahedge upward. If they start to see real volatility they'll be forced to deltahedge. If share price goes up from inflows, they'll need to deltahedge.\n\nThey'll then buy shares against their best interest cause the price go up more, causing more deltahedging, etc. I believe retail inflows will be that catalyst -- and if not, I'm piggybacking on the whale.\n\n**Keep in mind value is not created out of thin air.** The stock isn't magically worth more because there is low liquidity and a lot of open interest in options. The \"value\" is that MMs are likely not charging enough for premiums given how low liquidity is. Their loss is our gain.\n\nIf MMs are not deltahedging aggressively enough, then as ITM calls approach expiration they will be forced to buy shares and bump the price up further.\n\nEventually MMs will raise IVs to the point where they no longer need to hedge and can try to ride the volatility back down and recoup their losses.\n\nSo I'll repeat what I've said before: **When IV too high, do not buy.** If IV is high, you missed it. Wait for the next one.\n\nThis alreayd spiked once today. I've waited to see what happens, and now that it's stabilized I still believe the untapped masses will shoot this thing off again, and much higher than before.\n\n# 4. My Play\n\nI'm going in and out purely based on IV, as I believe once MMs get paid too much (eg: get paid on an IV that far exceeds actual volatility) the gamma bomb gets diffused because MMs will stop deltahedging. If they collect high premiums on OTM calls, for example, they can comfortable sit back and wait for those to become worthless. They're in no rush to deltahedge as they've pretty much already priced in the worse case scenario of insane volatility.\n\nMy target is for Sep 17 calls to hit 250-300% IV, then I'm out.\n\nI sold some during today's first spike, then rebought in now.\n\n**This is high risk, high reward.**\n\n# 5. Positions\n\nSept 17 $15 and $20.  I'm trimming if IV hits 250%, and selling if it hits 300%.",

When announced, $RH had a market cap of just $1BN with $500MM of net debt \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jnxsgm1hsn71.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61609fe2a3492764e0e543387b3ba91f23715ddc\n\n  \n\nAfter buying $1.7BN of his stock back, when most of Wall Street thought he was bankrupt, Wall Street analysts asked a simple question: \u201cWHAT IS THIS GUY DOING?\u201d This was G-Fried\u2019s answer: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Gary, answering the phone call from the Goldman analyst asking if he was insane](https://preview.redd.it/jupnwq74hsn71.png?width=513&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e1a6566bd8a2b7e4e5a2e6fd982ce59aaa8ead)\n\n  \n\nThis is what happened to $RH\u2019s balance sheet:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vb7ceej7hsn71.png?width=626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4917979821d00277aef8e0a629905dfbaf726d09\n\n  \n\nA lot less shares\u2026but a lot more debt. What did this man see? Usually, you only bet $ONE of $DEEZ $NUTZ, not $BOFA $DEEZ $NUTZ when you feel good about the future. This CEO YOLO\u2019d his company\n\nGary saw a disruptive business model, with a near monopoly on luxury furnishings, in a market that was ridding itself of real estate that enabled him to build shrines of greatness. Below is what happened to sales. At first, they went up. After COVID, they mooned. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lm5ky1ahsn71.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1932f2f2099e387427ba3ba68c75a733d46af7a\n\n  \n\n**$RH POST YOLO, A COUCH COMPANY THAT THINKS IT\u2019S A TECH STONK:** Today, $RH has continued to crush. What does $RH look like today? At face value, it looks like a hedge fund short come true: A company investing massively in super duper large furniture sales rooms and a company that sends out \u201cbrochures.\u201d \n\nBut what is actually happening? $RH is thinking big and going big. The Company\u2019s Design Galleries double retail revenue and profitability in each market they enter, providing huge synergies between the physical stores and the direct online business. This creates massive synergies with customer acquisition and brand building. Competitors, meanwhile, are stuck in a downward spiral of closing or downsizing their stores while $RH builds the largest specialty stores in the history of the industry.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5is4wj8chsn71.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2df9020995c7f86b9ee32c25d6fe1cae2d1a0e3e\n\n  \n\n$RH continues to elevate its brand by expanding its brand portfolio. There is now RH Interiors, RH Contemporary, RH Modern, RH $AMCStonk, RH Beach House, etc, etc. The Company is going to include Plane and Yacht design to further elevate and inspire customer. $RH is and is cementing its position as one of the world\u2019s great luxury brands. \n\n$RH believes that it could reach $25BN in sales in its current form. As it elevates itself in line with Hermes, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Cartier, etc, the Company will not trade at 4x sales, but instead move upward to the valuation range enjoyed by European luxury houses. Hermes, for instance, trades at 15x sales. At 10x sales, RH could reach a $250bn valuation, which would equate to a $12,500 share price (up from today\u2019s $700 share price)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7btyet1hhsn71.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ee95e411af161364bf04c220e8e47379cb1a9c2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS, Berkshire is the 3rd largest holder.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\nFull disclosure, I own 2,000 shares \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zes5lvmehsn71.png?width=363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c80ba55763ca46ddf5853ab1f3e68dc55f3deb37",

        "selftext": "I'm curious of any of ya'lls opinion on whether you think the growth of Tesla has been Musk driven or actual progress driven. I'm a turbomachinery engineer by trade, and I damn near went to work for SpaceX pretty recently actually, so I do have a sense of the engineering prowess the company has. But, we all know what a company is actually doing doesn't necessarily mean the stock price is going to respond similarly...it's mainly psychological not real; i.e., Gamestop and AMC. It's all a big meme. So hypothetically, say Musk's alien master race handlers come back and take him home, and we still have Tesla, what happens then?\n\nTSLA does have a massive head start in the EV world, and I myself own a ton of TSLA. I support Musk's goals and overall plan, and I do think he's a brilliant person, but he's also not as self-made as the fanboys say nor is he a super ethical person based on accounts of friends of mine and him. But is the image he's cultivated driving the company stock price, or are the numbers? That's the million dollar question.\n\nAlso, I'm just gonna say it, Stephen Mark Ryan the Solving the Money Problem guy acts like a complete shitbag who survives off of calling himself a genius and smelling his own farts. I don't think the man is stupid, nor is he wrong about many of things he says about Tesla, but GOD he's insufferable and so arrogant. His damn Youtube channel keeps getting pushed to me by the algorithm gods at Google and everytime I think \"...maybe this time it'll be different\", I watch a little, hear him gloat about all his money, call some people retarded, and I want to puke. I hope he gets a taste of his own eventually.",

        "selftext": "Okay you guys and gals, I'm back. Yes this has been a bloodbath. No getting around that.\n\nIn order for a squeeze to happen it requires 2 things: Public Interest &amp; Share Buying. \n\nInvestors often make the mistake of going \"well X factors and Y factors have happened so long as you've done the DD remain Bullish.\" The problem is that the general public are NOT investors and have no idea, nor are even aware of x or y factors. Those things simply have no affect on them. The general public is ONLY aware of hype. They have to see it enough, they have to hear it enough, they have to be shown proof that it's going...UP. That's right. While DD will keep investors happy to buy as the share price drops, a downward trend will scare off the general public. They only buy when things are going up. The stock has taken a beating and everyday has dripped down slowly but surely. That tells me that bulls are doing their best to hold on but even they are losing conviction by the hour. Thus the slow decline down. This stock needs a fresh new injection of public interest in order to spike up the price. Just the truth. Bulls have either spent all they can, or exited without plan to return in the near future. **The idea now is to flood YouTube Twitter Facebook etc with DD on $SPRT and well detailed explanations of WHY the si% increase is bullish- with examples and data given.** Target accounts with large followings, especially those related to energy/tech/crypto, because that's how you will reach the largest audiences possible. Tons of YouTube videos etc. That newfound sentiment has to be garnered. Write articles and publish them so people searching up the stock come across them. Things like that. Strategic planning. Just the truth. Eventually news will pick it up and wonder why so many articles have been written, why it's being discussed all over social media, etc. $GME at the beginning of the year had dedicated Bulls that ensured the public interest was extremely high. \n\nNext up is Share Buying. The concept is simple enough. Buy shares. Again Bulls are mostly spent. So this plays in tandem with the Public Interest support. Buying otm options at this point is a waste of money until this begins to trend upwards. \n\nWe have a long weekend coming up, monday is labor day. Every Friday the past month, the stock has spiked. It will happen again this Friday. Shorts generally do not like holding ver the weekend. They certainly will not want to hold over the long weekend. What am I saying? The best plan of action is to flood the internet and garner as much public interest on $SPRT by Friday. This will invoke a massive share buying process, forcing shorts to cover a higher si than before- with a lower float than before. Again the long weekend is coming up. If you read this, and are bullish, give at least one of those things a try. At the very least spread the general message as much as possible. Not just on reddit but across social media platforms. Again, the general public is the audience.",

        "selftext": "Okay - listen up folks.  You've all read the DD posted about GENI from both u/anpanman and u/repos3 which are filled with everything you need to know about the company, but this DD is about an individual (and please don't call me a cuck).  What if I told you that the President of North American Operations for Genius Sports is one of the single most important individuals in the history of ESPN and the NFL?  Ladies and Gentleman, I present to you the man with the Midas Touch, Steven Bornstein.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE MASTERMIND BEHIND ESPN**\n\n* In 1980, Steve joined a 4 month old startup that some of you have probably heard of called ESPN.  Ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner would later say of Bornstein, \"Steve brings a wealth of [experience](https://www.espn.com/pr/s/010410steveb.html) in broadcast, cable and new media.  He was instrumental in developing ESPN into the most valuable brand in sports programming.  And under his leadership, our internet business launched groundbreaking initiatives such as Enhanced TV, interactive online content and wireless applications that will provide ABC, as well as Disney's other businesses with important strategic advantages.\"\n* In 1987 he [stumbled and rumbled](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-08-14-8703010919-story.html) into the **first cable rights deal in NFL history**.  Sunday Night Football. Chris Berman. Surely you've watched it in your parents basement.\n\n&gt;*Bornstein recalls some of those early years at ESPN: \"Frankly, we were very close to going out of business in the early 80's.  It early became quite clear that we weren't going to be able to make any financial sense out of this unless we changed the model.  As a result, ESPN really invented the whole business of affiliation fees for the cable industry.  Ultimately, it was such a sound model that it obviously became the standard that the entire cable industry was built on.\"*\n\n* **1990 - with his early success at ESPN, he soon became youngest President and CEO at age 38.**\n* 1992 Established ESPN Enterprises which helped pave the way for the creation of [ESPN.com](https://ESPN.com)\n* 1992 ESPN Radio is launched\n* 1993 Oversaw the creation of ESPN2\n* 1993 Created the first ESPY's Award Show\n* 1995 First X-Games are held and teenage kids named Kyle finally have something to watch while slugging Surge\n* 1995 Bornstein presides over the Disney Acquisition of ESPN's parent company (Capital Cities)\n* 1996 Just like that Bornstein was promoted to President of ABC Sports\n* 1997 Created ESPN Classic\n* 1999 Promoted to President of ABC responsible for all media networks assets at ABC/Disney\n* Throughout the years he also created the mainstays of ESPN: Sportscenter, NFL Primetime, Baseball Tonight, Outside the Lines, etc\n* In his time at ESPN, his team won 59 Emmy's - absolute legend\n* In January 2000 after a long successful career - he ends his ESPN chapter\n\nRegarding his time at ESPN:\n\n&gt;*\"Steve was the* [*perfect*](https://www.sportsbroadcastinghalloffame.org/inductees/steve-bornstein/) *person for that job at that time,\" says NFL SVP of Broadcasting/NFL Films COO Howard Katz.  \"Were it not for Steve, I don't think ESPN would have seen the enormous growth that they've achieved\".*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*\"Steve was the perfect leader for that decade,\" says ESPN on-air stalwart Chris Berman. \"We could have made a lot of wrong turns, but we didn't, and the proofs is where we are today.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NFL GROWS OVER LEAPS AND BOUNDS**\n\n* In January 2003, Bornstein was named CEO of NFL Network and Executive Vice President of Media\n\n&gt;*\"Steve certainly left a lasting* [impact](https://www.sportsbroadcastinghalloffame.org/inductees/steve-bornstein/) *on the NFL,\" says NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. \"He launched the NFL Network and drove it to full distribution, but he did a lot more,  He built out our entire media operation, which is very complex and includes all of our digital assets, and he was a key strategist in our television negotiations and sponsorship agreeements.\"*\n\n* November 2003 the NFL Network was launched\n* Within 58 days they became the youngest network ever to win a [Sports Emmy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Emmy)\n* In 2006 Bornstein presided over the first season of games on the NFL Network\n* 2009 - Don't worry, you Adderall laden autists.  For those of you who can't concentrate on any one game, Bornstein spearheaded the creation of NFL RedZone, the widely acclaimed channel produced by the NFL Network that zips around live to the most exciting momements in every NFL game on Sunday afternoons delivering cheap thrills in the form of infinite touchdowns\n* Ultimately, Bornstein would bring the leagues internet and mobile assets in-house and help build NFL Media into a collection of league-owned media assets including NFL Network, [NFL.com](https://NFL.com), NFL Mobile, NFL RedZone, NFL Now, and NFL Films along with the NFL's social media platforms\n* 2014 steps down at [NFL](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/sports/football/nfl-television-pioneer-to-step-down-next-year.html) Network\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**^(After leaving the NFL, he went on to chase the next big market: esports.  In May 2021, Gamestop launched their esports Twitter Account but please remember, Steven Bornstein was on it first)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE ACTIVISION YEARS AND INAUGURAL ESPORTS LEAGUES**\n\n* In 2015, he was named head of the esports division at Activision, maker of popular titles such as Call of Duty, Starcraft, Overwatch, and Warcraft\n* In 2016, he oversaw the Activision acquisition of [MLG](https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/17485380/activision-blizzard-hires-fox-sports-exec-head-esports-division)\n* Summer 2017 creates a league for [Call of Duty](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/17/activision-just-joined-the-big-leagues.aspx) with total prizes of $3million.  This league would create regional competitions and live-streamed events throughout the year.\n* July 2017 launched the Overwatch League which became the first major esports league with city-based teams.  Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, even has a team\n\n*^(Steven Bornstein goes MIA and it's hard to find information about him between 2018 and 2021 but it seems like was working with various investment firms.  He appears to be a)* [*^(Senior Adviser)*](https://raine.com/team-member/steve-bornstein/) *^(to the Raine Group.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE NEXT BIG THING - GENIUS SPORTS - $GENI**\n\n* This all brings us to August 2021, Genius Sports Hires Steven Bornstein as President of North American Operations.\n* According to [GENI's press release](https://news.geniussports.com/genius-sports-appoints-former-nfl-network-and-espn-ceo-as-president-north-america/):  *As the head of the North American operations, Mr. Bornstein will optimize Genius Sports' regional business infrastructure to position the company for accelerated growth in existing and new areas, including* ***streaming.***  *This will include the sourcing and unlocking of value with new and existing sports partners including the NFL, NCAA, NASCAR, NBA, and MLB.  Additionally, Mr Bornstein will work closely with the executive team to identify innovative and revenue accretive acquisition targets.  He will also support the integration of recently acquired businesses, including Second Spectrum, which is the official data tracking and analytics provider of the EPL, NBA, and MLS.*\n* Before Steve's hire, GENI secured an exclusive rights deal with the NFL.  Presumably, the NFL thought their previous arrangement with Sportsradar (which the NFL chose not to renew) wasn't generating as much revenue from the sportsbooks as it could have been.  Since Bornstein's tenure, deals have been closed with most of the major sportsbooks and the rest should be completed in the near future.\n* Some of the sports books seem to feel fleeced by the deals, yet they've paid up.\n\n&gt;*\"They are* [charging 4x](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/) *for the same dataset.\" Said one sportsbook operator exec.*\n\n* I think a lot of it has to deal with GENI's leverage and the NFL's support of GENI but I can't help but think about Bornstein's role.\n\n&gt;Longtime NBC Exec Don Ohlmeyer had this to say regarding Steve's business prowess, \"Steve is one of those [pivotal people](https://www.sportsbroadcastinghalloffame.org/inductees/steve-bornstein/) in the history of sports television...He's a smart and tough negotiator, a tremendous leader, and one of the great innovators this business has ever seen.  He simply knows how to position the side he's representing to be successful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HERES MY TAKE**\n\n* Genius Sports has one of the best to ver do it on their team and  he's going to create value and help foster growth.  Everything this guy touches turns into gold.\n* Sports betting is in its infancy stages where states like Texas (with the most valuable sports franchise in North America: Dallas Cowboys at $1.6b) haven't even legalized sports gambling.\n* Reports are coming in from week 1 that NFL betting has more than [doubled year over year.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nfl-betting-arizona-geocomply-sports-betting-record-high/)..over 100% growth!!!\n* I view this company like how everyone thought AMZN was an \"online book store\" or TSLA was a \"car company\".  GENI isn't a \"gambling company\" or a \"provider of gambling data\", I mean sure they're going to rake in mountains of money from the NFL deal but they're to create new opportunities that we can't even begin to imagine yet.\n* IMO Sportsradar blows\n* Bornstein Bears get fukt\n\n**Positions**: Doggy and Reverse Cowgirl - also jacked tot he tits on commons and warrants",
