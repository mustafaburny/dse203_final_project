We've got [Mr. Beast investing $100,000 in whatever the top comment said to invest in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hrorfa/i_will_invest_100000_into_whatever_is_the_top/). We've got [Pokimane, asking what to invest in and becoming a moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f75eod/thank_you_for_giving_me_moderator/) and subsequently crashing the market in March. We have people who lost bets and had to [drink their pee](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gak2gf/i_said_if_spy_closed_green_today_i_would_drink_my/) and [tattoo our logo on their butt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/io8i5z/im_back_bitches/) (NSFW).\n\n#&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo if you have an insane trade idea, **post it here**! We look forward to roasting you like we did u/deepfuckingvalue when he posted about GameStop in 2019. He's worth 8 (9?) figures now, so who knows, maybe you'll be next?\n\nWhat you won't find here are political discussions, self-promotion, and other nastiness is not related to our single and most important goal: making money. \n\nFor those new to the subreddit, you'll notice that we use some \"colorful\" language. Rest assured, we mean you no harm. It might take a while to get used to how we talk, but you'll quickly find that this subreddit is surprisingly kind.\n\n#And we've got you! \n\nThe community here is incredible. Each and every one of you make this place great and better than it was the day before. \n\nFor those who have been around for a while, please reach out and help the newcomers. For those who are new, please don't hesitate to ask questions and get involved. \n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, thank you for being here.",

I\u2019ve read about college kids paying off their student loans, people being able to afford to pay for family members cancer treatment, pet owners being able to afford their pups surgery. It\u2019s incredible and I couldn\u2019t be more proud to know I have a stake in this historical moment in time with all of you. \nYou see those headlines? That pushback from the big suits of wall street? WE did that. Together. If today was any indication at all, they are shitting their pants right now. I urge all of you to hold AMC and take advantage of dips if you\u2019re inclined to do so. Please do not fall for hedge funds manipulating the market to send you into a panic sell frenzy. The squeeze may not be tomorrow, and maybe not Monday, but it\u2019s coming. I was DEEP in the red today and in any other scenario, I\u2019d be panicking but this is bigger than me. It\u2019s bigger than you, yes you reading this. This is a chance for us to come together as a collective and revolutionize the economy for better. \nDo your DD, stay on the ball, don\u2019t let emotions cloud your judgement. I\u2019m here to ride or die, AMC (and GME) to the fuckin moon baby, i love all you morons\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8",

        "selftext": "I got into $GME very late. I had a couple shares back at $20, had paper hands, and sold. I went all in a couple of days ago. Despite it only being a couple of days, I've been lurking here for a bit. The amount of 6 figure, 7 figure, and 8 figure gains I was seeing was blowing my mind. More than that, it was blowing my mind that nobody was selling. I thought, \"you made a 7 figure profit, what more do you want?\" Now that I'm all in, I've been staying more up to date with the things that are happening. And now I get it. I understand why nobody is selling. \n\nI just saw a video of a billionaire saying it's unfair what's going on. I saw a billionaire say, \"he's just trying to make a living\". I saw an article call WSB an alt-right hate group. I havent seen one billionaire against this movement speak on the recession of 2008. But I have seen stories in WSB of families deteriorating by the days because of the recession. I've seen blatant market manipulation to keep the common man from trading. I've seen countless slanders and whining over the last couple of weeks.\n\n \nYou know what else I've seen during this time? I saw a guy on here donate switches to St. Jude. I saw a different guy donate money to St. Jude. I saw a guy pay for his dogs surgery. I saw a dude pay off his student loans. I saw a CEO donate it all to a charity for small businesses. I've seen somebody be able to buy a place after living in their car. \n\n\nThis is all so much bigger than money. That's cliche as fuck, but God it's true. I'm stuck between my blood boiling and my eyes watering. Honestly, I don't have a huge investment into Gamestop. Its not like my shares alone hold any bearing on Melvin making this out alive or not - but it's all I have. I went from freaking out over losing $100 in a day, to losing thousands in a day and just kinda smirking. \n\nTo be honest, I planned on getting out if it hit $1000. But IM NOT GETTING OUT. Truthfully, I'll survive without this money if it tanks. Obviously money would be nice, but I know some others out there probably need it more. All that I do ask, if you do make it out of this not holding the bag, please do something good with your profits. Please don't turn into the greedy leeches on wall street. \n\n\ntl;dr - I like this stock. I like you all. Big like, no sell\n\nEdit: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 can we cook tendies out on Saturn or do we need to bring our own?",

        "selftext": "I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  \n\nDisclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: \n\n__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:\n\n1.\t\u2060Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.\n2.\t\u2060Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.\n3.\t\u2060Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n4.\t\u2060Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n5.\t\u2060At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n6.\t\u2060Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n7.\t\u2060The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  \n\n__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\n[Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.\n\n__TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",

        "selftext": "I have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. \"The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!\", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**\n\nHere is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.\n\nFor you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [\"Counterfeiting Stock 2.0\"](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, \"strategic fails\u2013to\u2013deliver.\" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.\n\nThis completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.\n\nThere are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more. \n\nMoreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME. E**ven if the average was just 3 shares per subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**\n\nGME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails\u2013to\u2013deliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and totaled up the number of shares that were essentially clearly counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \\~$125B market cap) had a total of 25,613 shares fail to be delivered, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 368 shares fail to be deliver. \n\nHow many shares of GME failed to deliver? **5,969,693**. *Almost 10% of GameStop's float did not settle in December*. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock: \n\n[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \\(x-axis\\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \\(y-axis\\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/462bbnphjme61.jpg?width=403&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a0691283f02268b80135dab1de856db182d0091)\n\nI think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. No real shares can be found **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.** \n\n*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*\n\nDisclaimer: I'm just a starving engineering PhD student and I don't work in finance. I have no inside knowledge of how the financial system works and I may be wrong on some of this. This is not financial advice and you shouldn't trade based on it. I am book-smart but I still eat crayons like the rest of you. Obligatory rocket: **\ud83d\ude80**",

        "selftext": " **Mods do not delete, this is important to me, please read**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.\n\nThose close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.\n\nTo Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.\n\nTo CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/).

Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.\n\nTo WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I can't seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post. I have no idea how to get this to stick and its important to me that the people I'm addressing read it.",

        "selftext": "Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n* Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.\n* Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.\n* A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n\\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.\n\n\\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days\n\n[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days\n\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\n**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**\n\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET. \n\nWe're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\n\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!\n\nEdit: Why trust me?

        "selftext": "Here is the longer DD for the short squeeze case for SLV, a follow-up from my shorter post a few hours ago.\n\nFirst things first, **don't do this until the GME rise is done.**  Lets conquer one market at a time. I am long GME but am going long SLV immediately after.\n\n**If you just want to know what to buy skip to the end**\n\nI present 2 investment DDs in this post, the short squeeze and the fundamentals.  If you want to see what to buy\n\n**The short squeeze:**\n\nBuy SLV shares and call options to force physical delivery of silver to the SLV vaults.\n\nThe silver futures market has oscillated between having roughly 100-1 and 500-1 ratio of paper traded silver to physical silver, but lets call it 250-1 for now.  This means that for every  250 ounces in open interest in the futures market, only 1 actually gets delivered.  Most traders would rather settle with cash rather than take delivery of thousands of ounces of silver and have to figure out to store and transport it in the future.\n\nThe people naked shorting silver via the futures markets are a couple of large banks and making them pay dearly for their over leveraged naked shorts would be incredible.  It's not Melvin capital on the other side of this trade, its JP Morgan.  Time to get some payback for the bailouts and manipulation they've done for decades (look up silver manipulation fines that JPM has paid over the years).\n\nThe way we create the squeeze is by forcing a much higher percentage of the futures contracts to actually deliver physical silver.  There is very little silver in the COMEX vaults or available to actually be use to deliver, and if they have to start buying en masse on the open market they will drive the price massively higher.  There is no way to magically create more physical silver in the world that is ready to be delivered.  With a stock you can eventually just issue more shares if the price rises too much, but this simply isn't the case here.  The futures market is kind of the wild west of the financial world.  Real commodities are being traded, and if you are short, you literally have to deliver thousands of ounces of silver per contract if the holder on the other side demands it.  If you remember oil going negative back in May, that was possible because futures are allowed to trade to their true value.  They aren't halted and that's what will make this so fun when the true squeeze happens.\n\nThe silver market is much larger than GME in terms of notional value, but there is very little physical silver actually readily available (think about the difference between total shares and the shares in the active float for a stock), and the paper silver trading hands in the futures market is hundreds of times larger than what is available.  Thus when they are forced to actually deliver physical silver it will create a massive short squeeze where an absurd amount of silver will be sought after (to fulfill their contractually obligated delivery) with very little available to actually buy.  They are naked shorting silver and will have to cover all at once and the float as a percentage of the total silver stock globally is truly miniscule.\n\n**The fundamentals:**\n\nThe current gold to silver ratio is 73-1.  Meaning the price of gold per ounce is 73 times the price of silver.  Naturally occurring silver is only 18.75 times as common as gold, so this ratio of 73-1 is quite high.  Until the early 20th century, silver prices were pegged at a 15-1 ratio to gold in the US because this ratio was relatively known even then.  In terms of current production, the ratio is even lower at 8-1.  Meaning we are only producing 8 ounces of silver for each newly produced ounce of gold.\n\nWe have been able to get away with producing so little new silver for so long because governments have dumped silver on the market for 80 years, but now their silver vaults are empty.  At the end of WW2 government vaults globally contained 10 billion ounces of silver, but as we moved to fiat currency and away from precious metal backed currencies, the amount held by governments has decreased to only 0.24 billion ounces as they dumped their supply into the market. But this dumping is done now as their remaining supply is basically nil.\n\nThis 0.24 billion ounces represents only  8% of the total supply of only 3 billion ounces stored as investment globally.  This means that 92% of that gold is held privately by institutions and by millions of boomer gold and silver bugs who have been sitting on meager gains for decades.  These boomers aren't going to sell no matter what because they see their silver cache as part of their doomsday prepper supplies.  It's locked away in bunkers they built 500 miles from their house.\n\n**We are about get 40 years worth of their gains in 4 months if we do this correctly.**\n\nThe reason that only 8 ounces of silver are produced for every 1 ounce of gold in today's world is because there aren't really any good naturally occurring silver deposits left in the world.  Silver is more common than gold in the earth's crust, but it is spread very thin.  Thus nearly every ounce of silver produces is actually a byproduct of mining for other metals such as gold or copper.  This means that even as the silver price skyrockets, it wont be easy to increase the supply of silver being produced.  Even if new mines were to be constructed, it could take years to come online.\n\nFinally, most of this newly created silver supply each year is used for productive purposes rather than kept for investment.  It is used in electronics, solar panels, and jewelry for the most part. This demand wont go away if the silver price rises, so the short sellers will be trying to get their hands on a very small slice of newly minted silver.  The solar market is also growing quickly and political pressure to increase solar and electric vehicles could provide more industrial demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What to buy:**\n\nI will be putting **50% directly into SLV shares, and 50% into the $35 strike SLV calls expiring 4/16**.  This way we create a groundswell into silver immediately that then rockets through a gamma squeeze as SLV approaches $35.  Price target of $75 for SLV by end of April if we pull this off.\n\nAlternate options:\n\n\\- buying physical silver; this also works but you pay a premium to buy and sell so its less efficient and you take fewer silver ounces off of the market because of the premium you pay\n\n\\- going long futures for February or March; if you are a rich bastard and can actually take physical delivery of 1000s of ounces of silver by all means do so.  But if you simply settle for cash you are actually part of the problem.  We need actual physical delivery, which is what SLV demands and is why SLV is the way to go unless you are going to take delivery\n\n\\- miners; do not buy miners as part of this trade.  Miners will absolutely go up if SLV goes up, but buying them doesn't create the squeeze in the actual silver market. Furthermore, most silver miners only derive 30-50% of their revenue from silver anyways, so eventually SLV will outperform them as it gets high enough (and each marginal SLV dollar only increases miner profits by a smaller and smaller percentage)\n\n**Details on SLV physical settlement:**\n\nWhen SLV issues shares, the custodian is forced to true up their vaults with the proportional amount of silver daily.  From the SLV prospectus:\"An investment in Shares is:  Backed by silver held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.  The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust. The Trustee\u2019s arrangements with the Custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no more than 1,100 ounces of silver in an unallocated form. The bulk of the Trust\u2019s silver holdings is represented by physical silver, identified on the Custodian\u2019s or, if applicable, sub-custodian's, books in allocated and unallocated accounts on behalf of the Trust and is held by the Custodian in London, New York and other locations that may be authorized in the future.\"\n\nJoin me brothers.  Lets take silver to the moon and take on the biggest and baddest manipulators in the world.  Please post rocket emojis in the comments as desired.",

The ruling class would never seed a meme about silver being a distraction to divide the community from adding another major step to their plan.\n\nPay no attention to how major banks have sold 200x more silver than they actually have and if they're called to deliver on all those receipts instead of people continuing to be happy to just hold paper receipts they could *hypothetically* exchange, then... well, like I said, no matter.\n\nThe important thing is to spend your weekend wondering what will happen to GME while there is no action you can take on it. Don't focus on anything you could take action right now.\n\nDon't sort comments by new. You don't want to see the unfiltered stream of consciousness of the subreddit, just stick to the carefully curated, vote-and-award-manipulated ranking of what everyone can agree on. We don't have any stickied threads sorted by new today because the people in charge here have your best interests at heart and they don't want you to get into trouble buying any silver. They're not like that other guy who tried to sell out the community, shame on him. Since they're not sellouts, there's no way they could ever make a mistake or allow the community to be misguided. Trust in them and blindly follow the subreddit's general direction at all times.\n\nAnd most importantly, don't forget, you're very small. Silver has a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Big banks and governments have a vested interest in it. Don't you dare think your little wallets could possibly tip the scales of something this big going on right in front of you. Just take your tendies and quit while you're ahead, and don't think too much about where this is all leading next.\n\nEDIT - We've got a usual stickied thread sorted by new, thanks mods! Good to see my satirical post rapidly becoming outdated. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

When I saw the $GME shit happening a week ago I thought it was pure stupidity and was not planning on investing. In fact, I bought some $GME puts (which I've since sold since somehow they've gone up based on volatility) betting against the crowd here.\n\nHowever, what has started as a decentralized short squeeze has morphed into a class movement. I'm a big populist and think we need big changes in this country, especially a transfer of wealth and power from the elites to the people. When this morphed into a class movement I became obsessed. However, I still wasn't going to buy in because I shy away from speculating on ultra risky stuff like this. But when Robinhood and all the other major brokerages colluded to cause a massive sell off, that's when it became a matter of principle. I've watched all day as the stock has remained relatively stable on very little volume. People are holding despite wall street twisting your arm and trying to make you tap out by only allowing you to sell. It's a beautiful thing to see. I don't think of my purchase as an investment, but as putting my own skin in the game as a fuck you against a rigged system.",

These people are SOLD. Read Canadian news channels regarding situation, they are much less biased!\n\n---\n\n##Let's make a list of the Brokers that betrayed the Retail Investor\n\nThe worst thing that happened this week, was the betrayal of our Brokers, choosing instead to side with the establishment and restricting the purchase of certain stocks, tanking those tickers.\n\nNow, I'm aware this is more complicated than that, and some clearing houses forced some Brokers to do it. **Even if that was true, the Brokers should tell clients that this is the cause, and they should be pushing, as much as we are, at getting this resolved.**\n\nHere is my initial list, please comment below and let me know which ones I've missed:\n\n## Bad Brokers - Restricted purchasing of certain tickets\n\n* Robinhood - [Join the lawsuit against them if you were affected](https://robinhoodgamestopclassaction.com/)\n* Interactive Brokers (US/CAN)\n* Webull - [Admitted they were forced to by clearing firm](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-bull-ceo-explains-why-trading-was-restricted-amid-the-game-stop-market-mania-172539318.html)\n* E-Trade\n* E-Toro\n\n\n\n## Good Brokers - Did not restrict trading\n\n* Fidelity \n* Questrade (CAN)\n\n\n---\n\nWe will keep this list on the sidebar...forever.

        "selftext": "When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c )\n\nToo much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n* Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.\n* Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.\n* A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n\\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.\n\n\\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days\n\n[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days\n\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\n**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**\n\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET. \n\nWe're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\n\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!\n\nEdit: Why trust me?

        "selftext": "I don't know if anyone else noticed, but Friday was kind of a big one for GME. It **ripped face** from $43 up to $75 in the morning session. That was fucking wild, even for this autist's dream of a stock. \n\nOther's have already commented on why this has happened, but I'll summarize for this dunces in the back. In short, though, the market makers wrote a LOT of 0DTE OTM calls at open, and then had to buy shares to cover when those calls went ITM around noon. This is what caused the absurd spike from $50 to $75 in just an hour and a half. That's the **gamma squeeze** that everyone has been talking about, where MM's couldn't cover fast enough.\n\nThe rest is history, GME closed at $65, and every single call that expired yesterday was ITM. That's fucking retarded. \n\nWhat this means, though, is that the MM's/brokers are going to have to deliver a ridiculous amount of shares when these expired options settle. Typically, settlement is on a Tuesday. I've read estimates that 10-15M shares worth of calls expires ITM on Friday. Again, this is fucking retarded. \n\nPlease note that **none** of the above movement relates directly to the short squeeze... but it will. Because there are now 10-15M shares tied up in the clearing houses, there are now ever **fewer** shares to be borrowed. Some are tied up in passive funds that can't sell unless a rebalance is being done. Some are tied up in diamond hands. Now, though, about 20% of the total float is **committed to the fucking clearing house** as they sort out Friday's shitshow. \n\nDemand for GME will continue to pump on Monday. It's a cultural event now, where every lay person can be a modern-day Robin Hood. The shorts are going to have their positions closed whether they like it or not if this continues (which it will). Since there are far far far fewer shares floating over the next 2 trading days, though, a squeeze on Monday or Tuesday could utterly destroy Melvin and the other shorts. \n\nIf RC even opens his twitter app this weekend, it's over. \n\nPositions: [Take what's yours, gents.](https://imgur.com/a/7ipopDo)",

        "selftext": "\nDear WallStreet and CNBC,\r\n\r\nYou have been calling this a speculative bubble, that GameStop will ultimately crash down to earth, and that the \u201clittle guys\u201d are going to get hurt. Jim Cramer wants us to \u201ctake your home run\u201d and sell. You use words like \u201cfundamentals\u201d and \u201cvaluations\u201d and says that the stock price is not justified. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the fundamental:\r\nI am an ER doctor that trained in inner city Detroit. When I was a resident physician, Obama was president. During his presidency, the quality of life of the predominantly African-Americans in the city did not improve. Despite Obamacare, I saw little improvement in the health outcomes of the patients I worked with. I saw continued proliferation of illicit drugs, overdoses, and gang violence. YOU have left these people behind.\r\n\r\nI spent the last several years working in a small town in the Midwest, when Trump was president. During his presidency, the quality of life of the predominantly white Americans also did not improve, and have in fact worsened. I saw continued proliferation of illicit drugs, overdoses, and suicides. These patients I care for are also people whom YOU have left behind. \n\r\nWith the pandemic, I have seen those who are already at the brink of financial solvency lose their jobs and I see lines outside food banks. I see the health outcomes of my patients decline as they forego preventive care. I, on the other hand, kept my job, got a raise, and saw the value of my 401k rise as the economy crashed around me. Going to work every day is a constant and stark reminder of the brokenness and disparity of the economic system and my sheer powerlessness to change it. I realize now that it is not political. It is YOU.\n\r\nI own GameStop because represents something to me. It is the very embodiment of the millennial generation that you have left behind- a down-and-out aging retailer that you feel is no longer worth investing in. We ARE GameStop. We are not selling because we believe in ourselves and investing in ourselves. We WANT to see it succeed.\n\r\nI am fully aware that I have benefited from having a 401k and it is what is supporting your industry. But this also means that YOU work for ME. I fully expect you to fuck over my generation to save yourselves by running to the politicians and regulators that you have bought to stop the squeeze and get them to suspend trading on $GME. It is not lost on us that the former Fed chair Ben Bernanke is a senior advisor at Citadel and that you paid Janet Yellen $800,000 in speaking fees. You will tell them that this is a \u201csystemic risk\u201d and that this will \u201ccrash the entire financial system\u201d. You will remind them what happened after they let Lehman Brothers fail in 2008. Don\u2019t.\n\r\nIf you are a politician or a regulator reading this, don\u2019t listen to their bullshit. If you intervene, stop trading of $GME, bail out hedge funds and big banks like you have in the past and try to placate us by dragging a few hedge fund managers in front of a congressional hearing, you\u2019ll unite the entire country against YOU. Make sure you are on the right side of this. You work for US too.\n \r\nThis country is broken and fractured. You have goaded us into tearing each other apart for years. This is the first time that I have seen the entire country rally behind a single cause. You have given us a reason to unite- against you and the system you have built and upheld. \r\n\r\nI own GameStop not because Diamond Hands. I own GameStop because I AM GameStop. I am choosing to invest in my generation, and selling would be selling myself out.",

        "selftext": "There's a rich kid in town. Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $5 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $195 with the coupon. Easiest $5 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 200 parents. He now has $40K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $39K. He'll have earned $1K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.\n\nThere's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.\n\nLater in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $5 off coupon and says, \"I'll take 200 Nintendo Switches please.\" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, \"Sorry, we're all sold out.\" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.\n\nMeanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.\n\nMelvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 200 Nintendo Switches.\n\nThe price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000. Meanwhile, Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing.",

We know billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation.\n\nAll of the best mines for silver have already been depleted in recent years.

        "selftext": "\nSPREAD THE WORD\n\nCredit to u/PsychoticC4rrot\n\nPlease read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you\u2019ll see today!!!\n\nThey didn\u2019t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold \u2014&gt; price goes down \u2014&gt; the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place \u2014&gt; price drops even more \u2014&gt; they keep doing that \u2014&gt; price drops lower every time \u2014&gt; but as long as we hold they weren\u2019t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don\u2019t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!\n\nFurthermore don\u2019t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I\u2018m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!\n\nREAD THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!\n\nEVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!\n\nSince it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c )\n\nWhen do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c )\n\nToo much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n\u2022 \u2060Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. \u2022 \u2060Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. \u2022 \u2060A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n\u2022 \u2060imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. \u2022 \u2060Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\nNow, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\n\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\n\nWe're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\n\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "First, credit to u/johnnydaggers for putting the pieces together in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/).\n\nMany of us are probably watching the short interest % of float to indicate when the short squeeze is squoze. At this point, the hedge funds clearly know this, given how hard they've spent the last couple days using their MSM shills to announce \"WE HAVE EXITED OUR SHORT POSITIONS!!! YOU WIN!\"\n\nThere is a chance we're going to see that short interest % of float number go down at the same time as the price drops. Failure-to-delivers may also go down, at least in appearance.\n\n# This is probably a lie.\n\nFailure-to-deliver numbers and the short interest % are just the tip of the giant dildo they're trying to fuck us with. If this thing is actually what it looks like, they have way, way, *way* more exposure to this shitstorm than they are letting on.\n\nThere are ways for hedge funds and their colluding market makers to hide their exposure to a counterfeit stock scheme / naked short / short attack. You can read all about it here: [counterfeiting stock 2.0](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) (again, credit to johnny for bringing this to our attention)\n\nIf you don't know how to read, just scroll down to the picture of the iceberg.\n\nIf you **do** know how to read but don't have a lot of time, still scroll down to the picture of the iceberg, and start reading from there.\n\n**TL: DR**\\-- using a bag of dirty tricks, hedge funds can \"unwind\" their *disclosed* short positions, without ever having to exit their *real* short positions-- the ones that are actually super dangerous and putting them at risk of insolvency. They are going to do everything they can to get us to sell, **up to and including fucking with the disclosed short interest % of float-- the number we're all watching.**\n\nSo watch the short interest with a titanic-sized grain of salt. It could go up, it could go down, but it's likely not anywhere close to their real risk exposure either way.\n\nMy GME positions:  4 @ 329, 2 @ 325, 13 @ 272.\n\nI originally bought in at $14 and sold at $19 like a paper-handed bitch.Now I'm holding until $10,000.\n\n*I'm an ape, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, this is not financial advice, do your own research, etc.*\n\n**EDIT:** if you have a lot of time on your hands and want some more research on how this works and maybe a little peek into what we're in for, see u/Sleavitt10's comment [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/glib7cs/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n**EDIT 2:** people are pointing out that that source I\u2019m using says short squeezes aren\u2019t really possible anymore, because counterfeiting can overcome any amount of buy-side pressure. And normally I would agree, but there are exceptions.\n\nLike when a counterfeiting scheme runs into a multi-million-man army of enraged retail investors who are willing to buy the stock at any price, for example. And remember, the longer this goes on, the more they lose, so they are highly motivated to produce a quick resolution. The desperate moves on Thursday and Friday that ultimately failed are proof of what a serious situation this is becoming for them.\n\nThe sheer number of retail investors who are buying this stock just to fuck up the short attack is absolutely mind boggling. So long as we maintain our numbers and resolve, they must spend more and more money to get out of the hole.\n\nHold. The. Line.\n\n**EDIT 3:** [IT'S ALREADY FUCKING HAPPENING.](https://twitter.com/jonpeterswrites/status/1356019766624923654) 6 hours ago shorts weren't covering, and suddenly they've covered 30 mil on 50 mil volume? I don't fucking THINK so. And even if they are, that doesn't unwind the 2-3x as many shorts built on top of imaginary shares.\n\n**EDIT 4:** to quote [Brought2UByAdderall](https://www.reddit.com/user/Brought2UByAdderall/), \"Fuck the stats.

        "selftext": "I get it, it\u2019s not the play. I\u2019m not saying sell your GME. I\u2019m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I\u2019m a regular guy who\u2019s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don\u2019t agree with me, just say so. \n\nI\u2019m also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks. \n\nBut, BUT, yesterday we did something they\u2019ve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That\u2019s what that big spike was, and that\u2019s why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it\u2019s too late. \n\nImpossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That\u2019s never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world. \n\n3516.16% of average trading volume. \n\nDo you get it? They\u2019ll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won\u2019t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. \n\nWhy do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don\u2019t want \u201cartificial\u201d spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That\u2019s why that spike went down right after the freeze.\n\nBut then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn\u2019t go down. The assholes who\u2019d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who\u2019d convinced them. \n\nEveryone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.\n\nWhat did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we\u2019re retards (they are correct). \n\nBut how come the price didn\u2019t go down? It\u2019s got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?\n\nBecause the retard brigade was buying it. There\u2019s 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that\u2019s 300m shares. \n\nNow imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets. \n\nAnd normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bubble that\u2019s going to crash on them. \n\nSo why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I\u2019m not saying sell GME). \n\nBecause GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who\u2019s just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.\n\nNot so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let\u2019s not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.\n\nYou know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why? \n\nWhat else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I\u2019m not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that\u2019s going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade \u2013 Do you think we\u2019re going to need more data this year than last year? \n\nRemember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn\u2019t handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?\n\nBut why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?   \n\n\nUS and Europe can\u2019t buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren\u2019t afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn\u2019t really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.\n\nWant proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to send them there.\n\nBut hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it\u2019s so great?\n\nAnswer: because Microsoft fucked them. That\u2019s right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who\u2019d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now. \n\nWorked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered. \n\nThe asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up. \n\nSo they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don\u2019t they have? Money. That\u2019s why they\u2019re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works. \n\nBut if we drive the share price up, do you think that\u2019s going to change? \n\nSo FUCK IT. I\u2019m in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I\u2019ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I\u2019ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.   \n\n\nTL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon.

Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \\~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.\n\nWe are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.\n\nBurry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.\n\nGME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying \"omnichannel\" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.\n\nNow I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.\n\nHoldiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency. \n\n[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:\n\n&gt;At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.\n\nManiacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every cuck analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.\n\nSo in the headin i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \\(another reason shorts are fuk\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)\n\n&gt;The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)\n\nThis alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:\n\n9.8/2.48 = \\~3.95   3.95 \\* $35.5 = \\~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better. \n\nfrom [statista](https://statista.com) :\n\n&gt;Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.\n\nIf we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \\* 1.0224\\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!\n\nI really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout \"DigITaL\" or \"BlOCKbuSTER\" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those cucks special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10. \n\n**Bears are betting against:**\n\nRyan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion\n\nMichael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april\n\nu/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale\n\nReggie Fils-Aim\u00e9, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo\n\nSenvest, a mega fund thats actively managed\n\nNorweigan sovereign wealth fund\n\nFidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit\n\nAll of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears\n\nMicrosoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----&gt; Ryan Cohen dies.\n\n# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.\n\nOk everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.\n\nAlthough I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.\n\nThis squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.\n\n**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**\n\n*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.\n\n*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million\n\n% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020\n\n% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.\n\nSome [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.\n\nThe recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could by 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.\n\nGamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.\n\n*Processing img xsetax08pwb61...*\n\nNeed rockets \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80:\n\nOk so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts \"blockbuster\" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?\n\nOrtex data from Jan 4th 2021:\n\n*Processing img urqb3c3zbwb61...*\n\nSo this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \\~21 to \\~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.\n\nThese shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.\n\nNow for the data for this week:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ortex short data for Jan 14th for Gamestop](https://preview.redd.it/5ryumpl1dwb61.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb80c09e1be7b2f36f6d3745983cef4ce2b2df9b)\n\nSHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20. \n\nCost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.\n\nLongs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to \ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/).\n\n**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**\n\nYou realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.\n\n**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**\n\n**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img t8odq9btgwb61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 3nqb33f0hwb61...*\n\nThese two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.\n\nSomething else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nWe are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.\n\nRegardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.\n\n**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**\n\nBear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.\n\nKodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**\n\nVolkswagen went from **\\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**\n\nOverstock went from **\\~$21 to $123**\n\nBlue apron went from **$2.31 to $18** \n\nIve been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.\n\n$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \\* 1.0281\\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. \ud83c\udf11 .\n\nThis shit can happen. Hold on.\n\n**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 4ysv7bzclwb61...*\n\nBasically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price. \n\nThis happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.\n\nNow we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.\n\n**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme\\_gang\\_there\\_hasnt\\_been\\_a\\_short\\_squeeze\\_yet/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme_gang_there_hasnt_been_a_short_squeeze_yet/)\n\nIHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD\n\nIhor I quote:\n\n&gt;**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down \"Short squeeze has happend\" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.\n\nThe bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.\n\n**Conclusion: Buy shares with cash not margin. Hold shares forever unless RC dies (Shame hes a cybernetic demigod), Melvin bad, Shorts fuk, \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08  posting bearish shit are doing weeklies for the second time after they expired red on friday, GME to $200 without squeeze, Ryan cohen a god, GME is still a value play, Good luck have fun.**",

If I was in their shoes, allowing a game squeeze to 1000 and knocking the price down because they think people will sell is not a bad move for them to make.\n\nThink about the hype of this subreddit, 1k is not a meme is the mindset of most people still. we are sitting at 320 AH, and the germans are going to have to do some work to get us higher in the pre market tomorrow. The goal is to close green EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS WEEK. It\u2019s the way that GME gets squeezed. A realistic way is if we maintain hype. Billboards, planes flying fuck you robinhood. Remember that we are not actually organized. And tomorrow is the start of what I think is the most crucial day for GME. The swings will be wild, a lot of people have transitioned to fidelity and more and more are coming. We need the eurobros to hold for us. They will tire us, they will start to seed doubt into your mind. Do not let them. Hold strong, hold steady, the squeeze has not happened yet. \n\nDiamond. Fucking.

        "selftext": "I've been around WSB now for about 5 years, mostly as a lurker.  I eventually created a reddit account but even then took a while to actually join the sub rather than just lurk.  So I was here for a good number of the \"fun\" moments of the last few years.  The box spreads that \"literally can't go tits up\".  Everyone piling on puts on snapchat.  Good 'ol Su Bae.  The great paper trading competition of 2019.  The ousting of \"he who shall not be named\" (the automod removed my post for mentioning his name).  Etcetera, etcetera...   But this will be my first post.\n\nOver the last week and especially the last 24 hours, I've seen a LOT of comments in the pinned threads lamenting the fact that WSB is forever changed and that it's time for another paper trading competition.  I want to speak to that for a moment and if the mods would be so kind as to keep this post up I'd be very grateful.\n\nFirst of all, yes, WSB has changed, but that's a *good thing.*  You know who else doesn't want change?  The hedge funds, and Wall Street.  The whole point of this thing that is happening IS CHANGE.  The fact that the world is standing to attention right now says something about this is real and that is much more important than being able to remove some noobs because their IQ is too high.\n\nEven worse than the comments calling for noobs to be eliminated, I've seen many commenters dissing people who can only afford small amounts of shares or even fractional shares.  So now WSB is elitist and you have to be wealthy to join and have fun in the markets?  NO!  That's the entire point of this place and GME and this week is that the market SHOULD NOT BE FOR THE ELITE ONLY.\n\n**Have 5mil and want to invest?  Great!  Have $5 and want to invest.  Great!**\n\nWSB endlessly attacks CNBC, etc for not being able to see that GME is NOT about WSB or the fundamentals of these companies, or about making money.  But it's about something much bigger.  And those people who are crying out for all the noobs here to be banned are no better than the entrenched elite like Stephen Weiss who yesterday called this whole thing \"load of crap\".\n\nWe all saw the open letter pinned earlier this week and the responses to it.  We all lived through last year.  And for the first time in a VERY long time, I feel like the world is coming together to unite rather than to divide and it feels f'ing GOOD.\n\nLet the moment stand for a bit.  I promise you that eventually people will forget about this and we will all start attacking each other again and most of the noobs on WSB will never set foot in this place again.\n\nBut for now, for today, for this weekend, and maybe a while more, let's be excellent to one another and not decide the worth of someone over how long they've had a reddit account or how much money is in their band account.\n\nSo to all the noobs:\n\nWelcome!  Hope you enjoy your stay.  It gets a little weird around here, so it would save you a lot of time if you just gave up and went mad now.",

        "selftext": "Since WSB grew millions overnight, I see a lot of questions regarding GME, I'll try to answer those here. \n\n**1. What's happening with GME?**\n\nThe GME play is a very simple problem of supply and demand. Without having to explain what shorting is, just know that as long as short interest is over 100% the following applies:\n\n- There are 100 sellers of GME\n- There are 200 buyers of GME\n\nWe (retail/shareholders) represent 100 of the buyers above, the other 100 buyers represent hedge funds. The difference being that we already bought, hedge funds are still on the hook. \n\nNow, because of this, hedge funds want to buy for as low a price as possible and every day that they don't, they are paying Billions in interest. This tips the tables in our favour since we don't have to pay any interest for not selling. \n\nIn a nutshell, if we don't sell, the price of GME can, theoriticaly, go to infinity.\n\n**2. How can you participate?**\n\nAll you need to do is buy $GME with YOUR cash. On Thursday we saw what happens if you buy shares with the enemy's money (margin), they short attack to push the price lower and sell your shares via a margin call. If you have a reputable broker you can also disable lending of your shares to further limit the supply.\n\n**3. What stage are we in?**\n\nIf you've seen The Big Short, we are in the stage where everyone realises the system is corrupt and the banks are scrambling to find a way to profit and not go bankrupt.\n\nIn this movie you are the ones betting that the housing market will go down and the hedge funds are the banks. The brokers (which disallowed buying of GME) are the rating agencies. \n\n**4. Is it safe to make this bet?**\n\nIn a non-corrupt free market buying GME while short interest is over 100% is a free money glitch. You're basically betting against corruption at this point in time.\n\nHistory has shown corruption is rampant so do not bet more than you're willing to lose. Think of it as a donation against corruption that might get you a lot of money if you win.\n\n**5. Is this what wallstreetbets is about?**\n\nNo, WSB is about taking risks and treating the market as a casino via the purchasing of derivatives (option contracts) in speculative plays. This is the first time in WSB history that buying shares is being advocated.\n\n**6. Is this financial advice?**\n\nNo, I just really like the stock.\n\n**Disclaimer:** \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15",

Not only are the videos of youtubers explaining what's going on increasing exponentially, but the incredible thing is that even influencers and youtubers completely outside the stock and financial game are talking about it.\n\nThe consequence of this is that a lot of people are getting informed, they are trying to understand what is happening, why it is happening, and what are the rules and mechanisms that are permitting this situation.\n\nThis wave of information is spreading at lightning speed financial concepts that have always remained obscure to most people.\n\nIn short, ordinary people are opening their eyes. Financial education, albeit minimal, is beginning to be part of the cultural baggage of young and old alike. And this will have huge consequences in the future.\n\nThis meme, and the whole GME situation, is opening the eyes to the world. I could compare it to the boost that the first trips to the moon gave to space engineering, or the boost to Karate gyms after the success of the movie Karate Kid, or the boost to medical culture that the pandemic that's hitting us is giving.\n\nThis, gentlemen, is the major event that is revolutionizing economic culture from the ground up.

And each one of you will be able, one day, to proudly say \"f\\*\\*k money, that time we were the protagonists\".\n\nBe honest: who else would have had such an opportunity to use money as a tool against the powerful market manipulators without GME?\n\nThis is why what is happening is not a meme anymore.

        "selftext": "I'm not a financial advisor I have positions in AMC and this is not a financial advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see a lot of people shitting on AMC for being framed a \"scape-goat\" for GME shorts to divert us from GME.\n\nThere is no doubt that short squeeze is apparent in GME but let me explain why AMC shorts can also get FUCKED by recent events.\n\n# 1. AMC Has a High Short Interest % [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)\n\nAMC is #2 on the list with a whopping 78.97% of float being shorted. and looking at the % held by institutions( 37.24% ) and assuming that these institutions are long on the stock, we're looking a short to float percentage of about **116.21%.** \n\nIf this is not enough to cause a short squeeze I don't know what will.\n\n# 2. AMC Got 2 Big Unexpected News.\n\nJust like how Ryan Cohen's involvement has started this crazy investing phenomena, AMC has also receive a bunch of unexpected news that caught the ears of boomer investors. \n\nRecently it has received a lot of funding to not go bankrupt and even wiped off their debt by diluting shares. This was a great move as many investors will be looking forward to hop in for brighter prospect of the company. Plus with the vaccines being released AMC will get back on their feet in no time. Also, since they recently raised money by diluting shares and wiping away their debt, there won't be more share dilution in the near future.\n\nLastly, with the whole GME scandal, it received soooo much coverage on media and the public  which is only going to hurt the shorts. \n\n# 3. New Shorts are In The House\n\nIf you look at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc) and [https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc) The shares available to short has gone down significantly. JUST 4 days ago the short availability was at **7 million** and now this morning it went all the way down to **500**(0 on fintel). \n\nThis means a lot of shorts possibly jumped in due to the recent jump in the stock price. However, what they don't realize is that this is an unprecedented time where millions of retailers are buying the stock to HOLD...because they like the stock. Not to bring down corrupt hedge fund fuckers of course. \n\n# 4. GME Steam Has Cooled Off a Bit\n\nI know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this last point but, personally, I think GME has potentially gone up to a point where retailers are not hopping in as much because of the high stock price but the ones who already got in are holding/adding to force the shorts to cover. This could explain why it really hasn't moved all that much in the past 2 days(except when it went down to like $132) despite people saying there will be a gamma squeeze today.\n\nAMC is sitting at $13.00 as of now and it is at a relatively more \"desirable\" price for normal people to hop in. Psychologically it FEELS better to hold 30 stocks than 1 stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not suggesting you should sell GME and buy AMC but I can see about 5x return on AMC and about 3x return on GME in the near future. and I like to make more money so my money goes to AMC. I can write about how I got those 3x and 5x but that's for next time.",
