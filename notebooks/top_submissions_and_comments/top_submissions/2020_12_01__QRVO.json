        "selftext": "So, think with me or just tell me that i'm a complete retard.\n\nQORVO, due to the 5g network and due to the latest earnings, seems a good stock to buy. And by looking at the graph, it seems that it will grow up to 170 soon.\n\nBABA, im really not sure. But as the new year+xmas is coming, maybe they will return to their best values. \n\nGME - PS5 and XBOX sells will make this company value go higher. It looks like that it wont stop growing until 01/21\n\nTDOC - Teladoc bought Livongo Health at the end of october. Since this, the chart has been growing and growing.\n\nI'm looking to keep this stocks until january/february. \n\nWhat do you guys think of these companies?",

        "selftext": "Sup bro's and broette's, I wanted to post an update that is 4 days old, scroll past the article for personal input:\n\n[ANN ARBOR, Mich., Dec. 15, 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zomedica-remain-domiciled-canada-135300103.html) (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zomedica Corp. (NYSE American: ZOM) (\u201cZomedica\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a veterinary health company creating point-of-care diagnostics products for dogs and cats, today announced that while a majority of shareholders voted at its Special Virtual-Only Meeting of Shareholders held on December 15, 2020 in favor of the **Company\u2019s proposed domestication to Delaware, shareholders failed to approve the proposal by the necessary 2/3 vote and therefore the domestication will not be implemented.**\n\n\"I would like to sincerely thank our many shareholders who supported management's recommendation and voted in favor of the domestication of Zomedica, which would have enabled management to achieve a significant cost savings for the Company,\" stated Robert Cohen, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Zomedica. Because the domestication proposal failed to receive the votes required for approval, the implementation of a new stock option plan will not occur even though it was approved by the requisite majority vote at the meeting. The Company will continue to use its present stock option plan to grant options to its personnel. Mr. Cohen further stated that, **\"Remaining a Canadian company will have no impact whatsoever on our upcoming commercial release of TRUFORMA\u2122, planned for March 30, 2021**. Management, as well as all employees of Zomedica, continues to be focused on that release, as evidenced by the recently announced \"launch team\" that has been put in place. We look forward to providing additional updates as we prepare for this exciting event.\u201d\n\n**Protected by approximately 70 issued and pending patents**, the TRUFORMA diagnostic platform uses Bulk Acoustic Wave (\u201cBAW\u201d) technology, **developed by Qorvo** (NASDAQ: QRVO), to provide a non-optical and fluorescence-free detection system for use at the point-of-care. BAW technology, **also used in cell phones and in the world\u2019s most advanced radar and communications systems**, is an extremely reliable and precise technology. Zomedica expects to begin commercial sales of TRUFORMA on March 30, 2021.\"\n\n**Personal Input** : So Cohen &amp; Gang failed to move to Delaware, which if they had succeeded would resulted in a reverse split that would had fucked over investors. The only option on the table (if memory serves me right) is shareholders approved a buy-back option the last time (few months ago?) to which ZOM/Cohen has since made no mention of to when that will begin, unless they had been already buying(verification needed). The release of TRUFORMA will have an impact on how pets are treated, providing a boost to the veterinary industry. The article also touches upon the use of the Bulk-Acoustic Wave (BAW) tech in other industries besides what ZOM is aiming for.\n\nWe know as shareholders (or lurkers if this is you) the recent lawsuit against ZOM failed as TRUFORMA is set for March 31 2021. Back in September they hit a low of $0.07ish and now at $0.1873. ZOM began their climb out in early November as the lawsuit failed. I say the lawsuit failed because from September up until their climb out of their 52 week low ZOM/Cohen were tight-lipped. \n\nWith all that said, I believe ZOM is a golden opportunity to jump into. I do NOT have an estimated price range of what this stock will be at March 31 2021; although I can safely say this stock will be higher than $0.60 come release date. Why?\n\nQORVO(ticker symbol QRVO) is the 'big daddy' in this development with ZOM. QORVO is trading at $162, when it was trading  at $70 March 23, 2020. Prior, if looking at the past year, they were trading at $119 near the end of December 2019. Their 5 year history shows this stock was trading at $43. QORVO has tremendous value and can stand easily on their own two legs, which begs the question: **Why does a semi-conductor company has interest in a veterinary company such as ZOM?**\n\n**My position:** 4,265 shares with an average of $0.15-$0.157 (the renaming of ZOM to ZOM Corp screwed with the average listing on Robinhood). I been holding since September. This imo is a long play.\n\n**Is it too late to jump in?** I personally believe it's not, there is obvious potential in ZOM's product and the way Cohen/The Board have been acting is greedy af, willing to fuck shareholders to increase their shares (which failed to remind you readers).\n\n**I advise you to do your own DD before jumping into this speculative stock.**\n\n**EDIT:** Forgot to mention Jim Cramer gave a shoutout to QORVO, ZOM's development partner fwiw.",

        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

        "selftext": "I've been dollar cost averaging in M1 Finance since October 28, 2019. I contributed $2000 for tax year 2019 and $6000 (max) for tax year 2020. I have current positions in the following: \n\nTTD, TSLA, FVRR, CRWD, PYPL, NFLX, SNPS, PINS, HUBS, TWLO \n\nMy last change, I took a little off the top with TWLO as I thought it was going to tank...it did not and it kept going. I wanted to spread some love to PYPL, NFLX, SNPS and PINS. I should have let it run, but oh wellz. \n\nWhat I'd like to do is hopefully have 40% annualized return so I can get $1,000,000 in a 10 year timeline. I'm not interested in going index funds (I will advise folks who are in their 20s to do that.) \n\nI am think of liquidating everything to keep my double-up and go into the following M1 pies: \n\n**Financial Pie** 25%\n\n**Consumer Cyclical Pie** 25%\n\n**Communication Services Pie** 25%\n\n**Technology Pie** 25%\n\n**\\*** **Financial Pie** \n\nLMND 50%\n\nPYPL 50%\n\n\\* **Consumer Cyclical Pie**\n\nAMZN 50%\n\nTSLA 50%\n\n\\* **Communication Services Pie**\n\nDIS 20%\n\nFVRR 20%\n\nPINS 20%\n\nTWLO 20%\n\nZM 20%\n\n\\* **Technology Pie**\n\nCRWD 17%\n\nHUBS 17%\n\nSHOP 17%\n\nTTD 17%\n\nADSK 16%\n\nOKTA 16%\n\n\\--------\n\nShould I start from scratch with the above? If I can get 40% or more of annualized returns with what I've done I'd be very happy. Once I get a million, I will then turn into a dividend investor and live off yields for the rest of my life. That's my goal anyway. I welcome any advice or being pointed in the right direction.",
