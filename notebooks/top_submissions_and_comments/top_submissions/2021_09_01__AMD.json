In the long term always seems to keep up with the pace of new tech and has solid workforce and at least since they dropped Bannon, management is on point\n\nAMZN- Absolute monster. Hard to not want it in my line up. They will continue to grow and buy up/absorb new tech and not afraid to buy up the little guy to increase their market share.\n\nAMD- I like them for the fact that their tech has been setting the bar as of late. While Intel or Nvidia might be bigger and have more market share, i think AMD has more potential over a long term.\n\nHD- I like the grasp on the non tech market they have. They do well during economic growth. They sustain during economic lulls. And even though I'm a Lowes guy, they are the workhorse in household consumer goods and building materials.\n\nBA- Chose this over an airline because it moves with the same news, but is tied in closely with US Military spending and  will sustain over times of peace and war.\n\nNote: Honestly i invest 70ish% in funds. And only about 25% of my portfolio is in blue chips. But thought it'd be fun to see what people choose and they're reasoning.",

        "selftext": "Hey retards, \n\nso ending normal funnies and jokes- here\u2019s something that you all will need to understand and hopefully help you on your tax understanding. \n\nNow it won\u2019t be much fun to read it but knowing it may be helpful to you at some point.\n\n1) what is wash sale rule? \n\n&gt;A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar.\n\nNow the actual way to understanding this is kind of complex and even out of the scope of this post. You can be held at a tax higher than your gain (some retard got a 800k tax bill in a 40k gain because of wash sale rule since he was trading same stocks 10+ times a day). \n\nBut do know that this rule, is made to stop shady things. It usually won\u2019t effect you because brokerages are smart enough to realize it and do mathematical calculation to your second buy to fix the wash sale rule instantly. But there can be mistakes. \n\nNOTE: you should only be paying taxes on your actual gain and deducting from your all losses (total after net year). If anything is wrong, see tax accountant instantly. \n\n2)  tax-loss harvesting\n\nThis is like algebra math where you try to add and subtract to get the best number. Say you have 2 positions, one in AMD and one in GME. You realized a gain (so you closed your position) on AMD but still have your GME options chugging along. Your GME options don\u2019t expire until next year but they are in loss. It\u2019s December- so you say \u201cwait, rather than pay full tax on my gains from AMD, why don\u2019t I close my GME positions for a loss and now I can subtract that loss from my AMD gain and pay less tax\u201d. \n\n3) deduction of capital loss\n\nYou say you have -20k realized loss in 2020. You can deduct 3000$ from your earned income every year until that 20k is used up. This means you lost 20k in stocks but made 60k in your job- you can automatically deduct 3000 from your income so now you effectively have a 57,000$ income for tax. \n\nNow some people are confused but this is only for EARNED INCOME. The 3000 deduction limit is so it\u2019s not abused. But say you have 2021 capital gain from GME of 15k. \n\nHere if you still had -20k loss of 2020, you can deduct the full 15k gain from 2021 so that -20k loss now is at 5k loss and use the remaining 3000 from 5k to deduct the earned income (from job) of 2021. For a total net loss of -2k still left for next year. \n\n4) positions that you hold for less than 1 year will be taxed at higher % than positions held more than year. \n\nThere are more Things like Tax-optimized Portfolio and many other tax implication that are too far out of reach for a single post but be aware of all these things. \n\nSPY 460c 9/10- free money",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CHIIIIIPPPPPPSSSSS - NOM NOM**\n\nGood morning ladies and gents. Lets talk about chips - semiconductors to be exact. If you have tried to purchase a car or refrigerator in the past few months you've noticed that either the price has increased or they are on backorder.\n\nUnfortunately, everything from your car's dashboard to your dragon shaped dildo now requires a computer chip. Because of this all this, the semiconductor/chip stocks have been shooting straight up (**AMD, TSM, NVDA**). Their valuations are high, but this is rightfully so since the semiconductor shortage is theoretically going to last until 2023 according to analysts (1). This is where **HIMX** enters the building.\n\n**HIMX** is a fabless semiconductor provider. They create a multitude of design solutions for visual displays (TV's, Laptops, mobile phones, car navigation, VR devices) as well as a whole host of additional products such as silicon IP's and LCOS micro displays for automotive HUD. The company is based in Taiwan, and has been chugging along during the pandemic, increasing their quarterly revenue growth by an impressive 95.5% yoy. It's quarterly earnings have beaten expectations during the last two quarters, but due to the China FUD and being located in Taiwan it's become risky for investors.\n\n**BEARISH POINTS**\n\nSo let me lay out the bear case before I start pumping the bull argument. There is a legitimate fear that China will eventually completely control Taiwan and impose the same tariffs that already exist for mainland China. This would drastically hurt business with the West, from which HIMX draws a large portion of it's customer base. Taiwan's position is that as long as they keep making semiconductors, they are important to the West, and we will protect them. At the moment, that's still the case, and looks like that will continue to be the case for the next few years.\n\nFrom a technical aspect this company is being shorted heavily. The put/call ratio is 1.34, the short interest on Aug 13th was 10.35%, and the short ratio everyday since Aug 13th has increased dramatically.\n\nSo if you think China doesn't plan to start WWIII, please keep reading.\n\n**BULLISH POINTS**\n\nThe bullish argument is that you have a company creating a product that is in high demand, and will continue to be in high demand in the near future. **TSM** has raised the prices of their semiconductors by 10% within the past month, it's likely that **HIMX** will follow suit. There are two opportunities for them to make this announcement within this week: Sept 6-7th dbAccess IAA Cars Virtual Conference 2021 and Sept 6-10th 22nd Credit Suisse Asian Technology Conference (2).\n\nWhen **HIMX** P/E is compared to other semiconductor stocks, it's much lower (Trailing P/E 9.94 vs. 32.55 for **TSM**). Within the past month the price action has pushed **HIMX** back down to the 200SMA, which it has been grinding along for the past week. The price action appears to be consolidating against the 200SMA which suggests a big move in either direction. According to FinTel the short borrow fee rate jumped from 0.7% to 1.86% on Sep 3rd. The number of shares available to borrow has been steadily decreasing within the past two weeks while the price has begun to stagnate. It appears HIMX is going to make a decent sized move soon, and with analysts suggesting a low PT of 19 and high 23.50, it's only a matter of time until this puppy pops (3).\n\nPositions:\n\n40x $13 10/15\n\nI had references to the little numbers in parenthesis, but WSB hates links, so I'm going to see if this gets through then I'll post them in the comments.

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Listen Apes. I know all of our tendies are being eaten by the big bad MM\u2019s and institutions, but I have a theory.\n\nThere is a reason normal stocks that are shorted do not usually exceed 100% short interest. Don\u2019t ask me the mechanics behind it, but I think this is something we can all agree on - just look at AMD, GE, and several other companies that have historically been on the brink of collapse. The events in which SI exceeds 100% are exceptional conditions, such as the case we have with TMC. \n\nWhile the reported short interest on TMC is not over 100%, between it being a delayed metric reported to the market and the fact that we can ALL AGREE with the low float and enormous Reddit volume to the buy side, that SI must be well in excess of 100%. Maybe well upward of 300%. I do not know how these shares are still borrowable at this point, but the shorts must be using synthetic shares and complex derivative agreements to keep up this selling pressure.\n\nWhat I think we can also ALL AGREE on is that there is a give and take to any type of strategy in the stonk market.\n\nWith the SI (I am speculating) in excess of 300% through the use of god-knows-what mechanisms employed by the MM\u2019s and institutions, combined with the fact that stonks actually shorted for the true intention of riding them down towards bankruptcy never exceed 100% of short interest, I think it likely that most of this SI activity will have to cover Monday or early next week. \n\nIf it were profitable to short every stock and make money with SI this high, it would happen more often but it does not. The MM\u2019s in our TMC scenario are not making money by driving the price down to this extent off shares. The money they are making is off the OTM options contracts to expire worthless. THIS profit off the options is worth MORE than the cost of the shares they are shorting. Not the ACTUAL cost of borrowing the shares, but manipulating the price beyond what is practical. \n\nWe see this with normal MM activity in any other stock. All those textbook resistance and support points you\u2019ve learned? The MM\u2019s smash through them by pennies most of the time to trigger stops and additional buying and selling that allows them to scoop shares cheap, drive the price back up, and sell them. This is only profitable if employed within reason. To do this with the purpose of gaining ABSOLUTE CONTROL over the share price means that the MM is incurring losses to do so.\n\nWhat does this have to do with TMC? Absolute control and synthetic short interest must come at a cost. This cost is lower than fulfilling all of the OI on ITM calls, which is why we are seeing it occur. MM\u2019s are loaded with short shares that are not economically profitable to buy back (as soon as they start to cover, the price rises like a chain reaction). They have exceeded the \u201cnatural equilibrium\u201d of how much price control they can obtain without taking on unadvantageous and unprofitable positions on these shares. I also theoreticize that through whatever synthetic shares/complex derivative agreements allow them to create such a large SI, most of these must be unwound very soon as they are not normal shorting transactions. \n\nHow can we still beat the MM\u2019s and institutions stealing our tendies in round 1 of our TMC fight? These synthetic shorts must be covered, and SOON. While they have had significant influence over the price of TMC today (Friday 9/17), it comes at the cost of price action to occur next week when they must cover. Think of the stock price like a trampoline - you can push down on it from the top or push up from the bottom, but as soon as you remove your hand it is back to  equilibrium. I think the MM\u2019s have offset equilibrium with this extreme control over downward price action, but when they are forced to cover (and they will be) TMC will begin trading up and equilibrium will be restored. \n\nI also think it is possible that multiple MM\u2019s/institutions could have competing interests, where it is profitable to be the first one to cover as opposed to the last. This hypothesis, if correct, could also create a chain reaction of sorts that drives the price back up next week. \n\nIn short:\n1. We can agree SI is higher than what is stated, maybe over 300%\n2. A stock shorted with intentions of actually riding it down to zero will not exceed 100% as bankruptcy approaches\n3. Complete and total pricing control comes at a cost, and equilibrium will be restored\n4. Points 1-3 are why TMC\u2019s price should increase\n5. I further speculate that the synthetic nature of these shorts could require them to be covered sooner than a normal shorting transaction (hopefully next week); and that there is incentive as a MM to be the first one to cover as opposed to the last. \n\nTakeaway? Don\u2019t panic today, if you\u2019re still holding shares it might be worth seeing what happens early next week. ALSO just looking at the closing price today and previous highs this week, it seems normal a little bit of mean reversion should occur and raise the price.",

        "selftext": "So I got an upgrade today. Instead of having to color in the lines (which is really hard) with crayons in coloring books, my wife's boyfriend let me draw funny lines on stonk charts for the first time (which was kinda cool). So this is what I found.\n\nBasically I think AMD is consolidating in a bullish pennant. It massively rallied from end of July to early August (the pole of the pennant) and since then has consolidated with lower highs and higher lows (the actual pennant). Moreover, volume has decreased since the rally, and the RSI 14 indicates the stock is reaching oversold territory, which could be signs of consolidation. Also, the price has been hanging around the EMA 50, which could mean we could see this level become a support if a breakout from the consolidation were to happen. Of course, we would like to see this pattern continue over the next few days to give further validity to the setup. I put the chart below but this was my first time and I am an ape so there's that.\n\n[Chart with funny lines for confirmation bias](https://preview.redd.it/k09sccuh9xm71.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ec92ddba99cab361a6d4ee80f1824dd4f40b119)\n\nObligatory this is not financial advice, don't overextend and do your own \"research\" I guess.",

        "selftext": "Redbubble is an ASX-Listed online marketplace for independent artists that provides printed products. Here was there recent investor presentation. Most of their customers are based in North America amd Europe. They are currently heavily undervalued at around $1.1B AUD ($800M USD).\n\nhttps://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02408798-3A573176?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4\n\nThe company currently has aggressive plans to grow their revenue to $1.5B AUD by 2024, afterwards focusing more efforts on raising margins. Their CAGR for the past 5 years has been 41% on average. Guidance until 2024 is around 20-30% CAGR. Their current revenue is around $657M AUD with a gross profit of $223M AUD. \n\nHere are some of their key selling points. \n\nTheir business is being pushed by 3 key trends: a) they are an emerging winner in a rapidly shifting landscape (personalisation of e-commerce goods), b) this is reinforcing the inherent flywheel (network) effects and c) the shift to e-commerce and online has been accelerated by COVID - this is a structural change, we aren't going back\n\nThey have a very strong balance sheet and a nice cash buffer ($99M). They are cash flow positive, generating $51M EBITDA for FY21. \n\nThe valuation multiple is still extremely low and enticing at circa 2x MP revenue, compared to comparators at 10x revenue or more. \n\nI want to emphasise the comparison between Etsy here because their business model is inherently similar, utilizing the incredibly rare flywheel effect between artists and customers. Their growth rate is also very similar. At current revenue, my estimates would put them at 3-4 years behind Etsy. \n\nEtsy Revenue (USD)\n\n2015 - 273M \n2016 - 364M\n2017 - 441M\n2018 - 603M\n2019 - 818M\n2020 - 1.7B\n\nRedbubble Revenue (AUD). \n\n2019 - 306M\n2020 - 416M\n2021 - 657M\n2024 - 1.5B Target\n\nEtsy's has appreciated 25x over the past 4-5 years. Not only did Etsy's valuation increase with its revenues, but also its revenue multiple too. The current difference in valuation between Etsy and RBL is around 37x. \n\nMostly because RBL is listed on the ASX and relatively unknown globally (yet). Also because Australian funds are typically value investors. OTCMKTS is RDBBY. \n\nThe Australian Tech scene is actually fairly well developed with Atlassian, Afterpay and Xero. Redbubble is shaping up to be the next giant, currently with a very attractive valuation that could yield significant returns in the upcoming years as they start to get noticed by the big NASDAQ players.",

strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader.

        "selftext": "If you have a pulse and have been paying attention to stock news over the past week, you probably saw that MDB (MongoDB) made a HUGE FUCKING RUN post-earnings release. If you weren't in on this (as most weren't) you're probably looking at this and wonder what happens next?  \n\n\nWhile I don't have a crystal ball, what I can provide is some technical analysis and discussion on the dynamics, what happened to the stock, why it shot up so much, and where it might head from here based on that technical analysis and due dilligence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nWe're, generally speaking, \"off the known map,\" but some indicators and dynamics suggest that the stock may still have room to run IF call sellers/short sellers have not yet fully covered as this kind of run with these kinds of dynamics includes some gamma and short squeeze factors.  If they have, chances are it'll probably go down this coming week. It could also run if there's a lot of interest in the stock, because the liquid float is probably pretty small but that could change if institutions shift position. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Anal-ysis:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[HOLY FUCKING SHIT](https://preview.redd.it/7u4ovm6hnyl71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ece7331b268228b06090b3ac89ff1aac65d884a4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook at that! I've got bad news for you... your wife's boyfriend is Godzilla, and he just gaped the fuck out of her. You're never fitting in there again!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the monthly chart using a William's alligator indicator (the green, red, and blue moving average lines), fractal directionals (the triangles), and a volume weighted moving average (purple line).  \n\n\nWhen you have a move like this where you've found an all time high in basically one day of trading, no moving average or technical is going to be completely reliable, so take this analysis with a grain of salt.  One thing to note on this chart is that the Volume Weighted Moving Average has not crossed over the green line on the alligator indicator, which will come into play later on in our discussion. This suggests that there's still positive momentum in the run. While monthly RSI and MACD are clearly showing an overbought pattern, note that the MACD moving average line has not crossed the signal line YET.  The alligator indicator is still open (spread out, like your wife after Godzilla's bit run) but that's not predictive of direction, and we'll see why in a later chart.  \n\n\nThe suggestion here is that while volume lost some steam later in the day, there's still some juice in the tank according to this run, even though it's overly stretched.\n\n# \n\n# What does MDB's history tell us about behavior around earnings and big swing pattern?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB historical earnings and Fibonacci ranges 1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/cqe62t0voyl71.png?width=1827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=715f2387eee85784a2af62a4a75aa531cc7b71a2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMDB moves significantly around earnings catalysts, essentially amplifying prior trends lately. In the past 3 earnings patterns, what we see is a Fibonacci relationship starting from the pre-earnings trend. In the two upswings, what we see if you track the entire pattern, making 0 level your earnings date, what we get is significance around the 1.618 and 2.618 fib retracement zones. On the decline, we bounce off the 1.618 and return to the 0 line before generating a new fractal direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese tends last for about 2 months, with most of the change happening during the latter half of the period. This suggests broadly that the pattern for these catalysts with the stock is to amplify existing trends until they play out their directional dynamics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this earnings report response is drastically different... we didn't hit the 2.618 over the span of a few weeks from the 0 line... we did it in 1 day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This has to be the definition of a rocket](https://preview.redd.it/swcwm05rqyl71.png?width=1815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a709541bdefa3cc26d18e8c600f8b38f6f2a4bbf)\n\nWhile historical trends might suggest this means the run is over, and it very well may be. There are definitely some reversal candles in the prior charts and some bouncing around in the space between 2.618 and 0, but each one eventually bounces down to t he 1.618 range. \n\nSince this was exaggerated, though, I don't know that the old Fibonacci relationship matters anymore. This could very well break the 2.618 tomorrow on a squeeze dynamic and then all bets are off as to where it could stop. \n\nThe proof will be in the early day trade, I think. If it runs very early in the trading session, that could very well be a sign of a continuing squeeze in motion. If it doesn't, I'm looking at a target in the 1.618 range just below $450. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Can we learn anything else from these technicals about how the stock trades and what signals we can possibly use? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB 1 year chart 9-6-2021 Fractals, Alligator moving averages, VWMA crossover](https://preview.redd.it/mtsw9x8rryl71.png?width=1821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c67a2d9482dcbfab300c0fcb40865dd1242d59b1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the one year chart, the VWMA (Volume Weighted Moving Average) appears to be predictive on big movement around catalysts. I've marked all of the points where it converges on big moves where put/call trades would have been profitable around a catalyst/predictable big trend change had we used them as buy/sell signals. Of course, these are not perfectly predictive in all circumstances, so supplement any moves with knowledge of catalysts and other externals that you might have available, but currently the VWMA has not crossed over to a sell-off signal yet. It's flirting with it on the Monthly chart, and the intra-day signals are crossed over back and forth but aren't really applicable to the larger trend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis could be a statistical anomaly, but it could also be evidence that there's still room for the stock to run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# If the run were to continue, how would it happen?\n\nMDB, compared to other tech stocks, is a stock with a very low liquid float. Unlike AMD, which has a float of 1.21B, MDB's float is only around 60M once you account for insiders locked into the open shares statistic. It also sports an almost 89% institutional ownership position:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/v7j1wq7dtyl71.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e1bb1043cfa0d83b4632b8fe0af19fbb0a3e8ff)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVolume is traditionally EXTREMELY low:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB volume history](https://preview.redd.it/xz3q120ityl71.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d66229d85d91495a51e8c1a10b172340030648)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe options chain for this week was much higher than normal as a result of the activity, and increased significantly over the span of just a couple of days:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB 9-3 options chain](https://preview.redd.it/diycy8ymtyl71.png?width=1311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fd5f85db9259115d4041abf96f9a8c861a5809a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile the impact of options chains in gamma squeezes is somewhat controversial since a large percentage of the shares will be covered calls, there's an open question about delta hedging and cash-backed call selling by market makers and institutionals which is central to calls and short covering. Basically, if you have a stock like MDB which is shooting WAY up in a short period of time, the best way to cover yourself is to buy stock so that the value of the stock rides up and you're left with less cost once the stock levels out at the top.\n\nThe most simple method of doing this is a 100% stock-covered call, which most low-level traders have to do because of how their brokers operate. \n\nThat's inefficient, though, since the delta on any one short call may start out more like the .3-.5 range depending on volatility, etc... so more advanced traders don't fully cover a call, they delta hedge by buying only the shares to cover the delta and flex up as needed.  \n\n\nBut delta on all of these calls would have increased insanely fast as they all wound up ITM, and the cover would have been necessary during the run-up OR after the fact if it continues to run up. What anyone who hasn't covered right now is probably looking for is a nice even plateau with a sign of upward motion to buy in to limit losses, or a decline in the price to limit losses.\n\nSpeaking of short interest, here's the short interest in the MDB:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB short interest](https://preview.redd.it/epif7wt5vyl71.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=774f7cc53ca46c1708d01637ff41ae11a0761d74)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost other sites have it around the 9-million mark, give or take.\n\nAdd this all up and what do you get?  \n\n\nA 6 million volume day which increased the stock price by 26%, against a float which is almost 90% owned by institutions, with a short interest which the latest figures suggest is close to 9%, and an options market which is usually small for the stock essentially exploding in value and volume. Any positive movement with this small liquid float is going to increase the dynamic, forcing cover by any entities that haven't yet covered to consider hedging. If this runs up in the morning, it could continue to increase as the available float reduces.  \n\n\nOf course, since institutions own most of the float, they may be tempted to sell to shape the price for ideal cover if they have exposure, so that may result in a structured sell-off, but the difference between the short interest and institutional ownership suggests greater potential upside from the stock's price increase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a result, all technicals suggesting a top aside, my bias is towards a continuing upside.\n\nSince I can't be sure of that upside, I'm currently running a strangle on the stock to see where it goes.\n\n# Positions:\n\n450p/550c exp 9/10\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[450p](https://preview.redd.it/24nv91rxwyl71.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db51147a333d85d33df52070a2e2cde97282e822)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[550c](https://preview.redd.it/qnlq2buywyl71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecd1ce1e77b8d5e793dbd2f87a80e79aa413888d)",

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lymm2dhxxno71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92228b5de309258f52e667bf370e4ed1b6d8322e\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Redbubble is an ASX-Listed online marketplace for independent artists that provides printed products. Here was there recent investor presentation. Most of their customers are based in North America amd Europe. They are currently heavily undervalued at around $1.1B AUD ($800M USD).\n\nhttps://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02408798-3A573176?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4\n\nThe company currently has aggressive plans to grow their revenue to $1.5B AUD by 2024, afterwards focusing more efforts on raising margins. Their CAGR for the past 5 years has been 41% on average. Guidance until 2024 is around 20-30% CAGR. Their current revenue is around $657M AUD with a gross profit of $223M AUD. \n\nHere are some of their key selling points. \n\nTheir business is being pushed by 3 key trends: a) they are an emerging winner in a rapidly shifting landscape (personalisation of e-commerce goods), b) this is reinforcing the inherent flywheel (network) effects and c) the shift to e-commerce and online has been accelerated by COVID - this is a structural change, we aren't going back\n\nThey have a very strong balance sheet and a nice cash buffer ($99M). They are cash flow positive, generating $51M EBITDA for FY21. \n\nThe valuation multiple is still extremely low and enticing at circa 2x MP revenue, compared to comparators at 10x revenue or more. \n\nI want to emphasise the comparison between Etsy here because their business model is inherently similar, utilizing the incredibly rare flywheel effect between artists and customers. Their growth rate is also very similar. At current revenue, my estimates would put them at 3-4 years behind Etsy. \n\nEtsy Revenue (USD)\n\n2015 - 273M \n2016 - 364M\n2017 - 441M\n2018 - 603M\n2019 - 818M\n2020 - 1.7B\n\nRedbubble Revenue (AUD). \n\n2019 - 306M\n2020 - 416M\n2021 - 657M\n2024 - 1.5B Target\n\nEtsy's has appreciated 25x over the past 4-5 years. Not only did Etsy's valuation increase with its revenues, but also its revenue multiple too. The current difference in valuation between Etsy and RBL is around 37x. \n\nMostly because RBL is listed on the ASX and relatively unknown globally (yet). Also because Australian funds are typically value investors. OTCMKTS is RDBBY. \n\nThe Australian Tech scene is actually fairly well developed with Atlassian, Afterpay and Xero. Redbubble is shaping up to be the next giant, currently with a very attractive valuation that could yield significant returns in the upcoming years as they start to get noticed by the big NASDAQ players.",

        "selftext": " AMD, MSFT, AAPL, MU, MRNA are on my short list.\n\nFor a while, I've traded financials and new-space. But, financials are way too high now and are going to burn-up on reentry so I'm looking for a cyclical that's hit the hardest to \"buy the dip\".\n\nBut - I've ignored quite a few sectors for a time and the first question is \"which are dipping and which are staying down\"?\n\nMSFT has seemed a pretty strong candidate for a while, as well as AAPL, but I feel both got too much play up until recently and have more to pull back (whether that looks like price down or sideways for a period of time, who knows).\n\nMRNA is definitely a cult classic, I don't know if it's overvalued or undervalued. Very tip-of-the-spear in biotech, a few more tricks up their sleeves, earnings seem strong.\n\nAMD and MU are getting pummeled by the usual - chip shortage driven price inflation with a strong pullback when it's realized the chip shortage isn't \\*THAT\\* bad....but both have strong fundamentals as well.\n\nSo AMD and MU are attractive, but MU definitely seems like something's wrong - don't know what yet, but 6 months since an ATH during a huge tech bull run?

What does HIMAX make you ask? Money. Now I\u2019m no expert on money but what I do know is a deal when I see one. With a SP of under $11, a market cap of 1.8 billion and a PE of 8.5 HIMAX is literally fucking your wife as you read this. \n\n\nFrom what I gather HIMAX is a 10 inch player from 3 inch Taiwan.\n\n\nI will now copy/paste some shit I found on the internet to fill you in on what they do because I\u2019m too retarded to grasp it. This company is a sleeping giant, the price can 10x and it\u2019ll only be twice as large as it\u2019s direct competitor, Marvell, and be 10x less than AMD. \n\n\n\u201cHIMAX is a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used  in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and other consumer electronics devices. Additionally, it designs and provides controllers for touch sensor displays, in-cell Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions, LED driver ICs, power management ICs, scaler products for monitors and projectors, tailor-made video processing IC solution, silicon IPs and LCOS micro-displays for augmented reality (AR) devices and head-up displays (HUD) for automotive. Additional offers include digital camera solutions, including CMOS image sensors and wafer level optics for AR devices, 3D sensing and machine vision, which are used in a wide variety of applications such as mobile phone, tablet, laptop, TV, PC camera, automobile, security, medical devices, home appliance and Internet of Things\u201d. \n\n\nTVs \u2705 \nLaptops \u2705 \nMonitors \u2705 \nTablets \u2705 \nCellphones \u2705 \nCameras \u2705 \nCar navigation \u2705 \nVirtual reality \u2705 \n\n\nEverything your wife\u2019s boyfriend bought you most likely has HIMAX technology in it. On a scale of 1- I\u2019m a virgin HIMAX is a horse gangbang. Not only are they doing things I don\u2019t understand with everyday things like cellphones and TVs they are also doing it with AR and VR. VR is inevitably part of our future. Not only is the AR/VR segment not priced into HIMAX, the chip shortage is. This makes my penis harder than when you clean your wife\u2019s creampie from a rando. \n\n\nIts not everyday you find a gem like this from a shitpost that doesn\u2019t belong to some intern from a hedge fund. \n\nPositions: 3k shares 50 dec 17 $13c.",

With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.\n\n**Main Watchlist:**\n\nGapping UP:\n\n* AVIR\n* BRKS\n* UVXY\n\nGapping DOWN:\n\n* TSLA\n* BABA\n* NIO\n* BA\n* UAL\n* AMD\n* PUK\n* CLF\n* AMC\n\n**Market Outlook:**\n\nStocks are looking to open lower this morning after some choppiness in last week's sessions. The Fed is set to hold its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, and we could be getting an indicator as to when the Fed will taper its asset purchase program. US Treasury Secretary called for Congress to raise the US debt ceiling, and that failing to do so would generate \"widespread economic catastrophe\". There are also concerns that Chinese Evergrande Group, a Chinese real estate juggernaut, could collapse because of major debt. Shares were down more than 10% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Adding to the fear is the broader crackdown on real estate by the Chinese government; this situation is worth monitoring, as it could have effects on the overall market. Worth watching UVXY if we continue to see fear in the market.\u00a0\n\nSPY is currently trading a bit under 434, and if we see more weakness we could test the SMA(100) as support at \\~432. We'll see what things look like closer to open, but regardless, we should see some volatility today. DIA is trading just under 339, after breaking down below the SMA(100) in last week's trading. We could see a retrace to the \\~332 level by the SMA(200) if we continue to see weakness. Potential support levels at 337 and 335, so we could see a bounce. QQQ\u00a0is trading a bit under 367 and is currently gapping down below the SMA(50). 370 will now be a key resistance point, and we could be in for a bigger correction if we can't get back above that 370 level today. Gold and silver are up a bit this morning, while crude oil is pulling back. Crude oil is currently hovering right around $70 per barrel, we'll see if that holds up. B\\*\\*coin is currently trading around 42,800 and things are looking bearish at the moment. Unless we see a strong bounce off support at these levels, we could see more selling off in the near future. Cr\\*\\*to-related stocks are down in premarket trading, as a result. Airlines and cruise stocks are down this morning. It will be worth watching to see if we bounce off support levels sometime this morning, or continue to see weakness. Meme stocks are showing weakness at the moment, but worth keeping on the radar.\u00a0\n\nRemember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses).

It is in our very nature as humans to take risk sometimes for that ultimate return of maximum reward. Having been raised in Las Vegas, I was taught to stay away from America's sin city, even though my dad worked in a Casino before. Growing up, I did. Now, I'm not trading or passing chips or cards around a table, I'm on comfortably on my phone, trading options, almost all-in style with CLOV, GME, BB, BABA(puts), APPL, F, TSLA, AMD, and a few others as my chips. I now know why this sub has coined the term \"FD\", oh boy, those chips are fucking delicious. I have been quite silent so far here, just observing, only to talk now that I, have earned almost $400 thousand dollars (accumulated), the most money in my life, in just 17 months of gambling (I don't do no research). Thanks to this sub for the meme stocks you created and more so, the trend setting you have put up for the stocks. I bought my dream car, a 2nd hand Porsche 911 Gt2, vacationing from Miami, to London, back to Cuba, Colombia, As far as The Philippines, and Australia and getting pussy from all of those places more than I can ever drink. Sure, I'm not like the big shot celebrities to do those on the daily, but man, the experience of it is life-changing. These are the things I never thought would come to ever, as I was raised to stay away from taking risks. With that all said, fellow apes, Options are better than sex, Options are better than having a family, options, are life. Gambling, is the mind's greatest creation.",

        "selftext": "All of my recent options plays have gone to shit. In large part because I put zero effort into research anymore. See stock going down, buy deep otm weekly calls on said stock, stare at charts and watch myself lose money for about 15 minutes. Get mad that I'm losing money. Close robinhood. \n\nA couple hours later I'll be busy doing something else and I'll randomly remember to check robinhood. Instantly my heart starts racing and I frantically grab my phone, open up robinhood. If my position is deep in the red I stare at charts for a minute or two, take some extra strength black tar copium, accept the fact I will lose all of that money, and close robinhood again. \n\nIn the rare occasion that the position is deep in the green, I exhale a sigh of relief, stare at charts for 10 minutes, get nervous as I watch the stock start to tank, continue staring at the chart as half of my gains disappear, sell my options so I can relax and enjoy the rest of my day without distractions. \n\nI had finally decided I was done with this roller coaster ride. I started to think \"You know what, I've lost a lot of money on options, but I'm fine with it. I'm still doing well. I'm just going to stop playing with them, since they aren't helping me gain money, and I'm just going to focus on work.\" \n\n\nThere was still a part of me that wanted to play with options though so I decided I would make one final yolo and be done with it. Bought on the dip a bunch of slightly OTM AMD calls expiring tomorrow, and some $1 otm SPY calls expiring next week. \n\n\nStuck to the playbook by staring at charts for 20 minutes, started losing money fast. Was down $300. Doubled down on AMD after freeing up some cash selling a few stocks. Everything came back up a little bit but then started going down again. \"Oh well, if this doesn't pan out I will just stop playing options\" I thought to myself. \n\nI then closed robinhood and went out to do some maintenance on my truck and totally forget about the whole thing. \n\nIn typical fashion, all of the sudden I think \"Oh shit! The calls!\" and open robinhood. Only to find myself up 95% on my AMD calls and 30%+ on my spy calls. \n\nThese gains have made up for the last 3 months of my shitty options trading. I know this is going to go to my head and lead to more bad trading. Even though I am self aware enough to acknowledge this I know it's not going to make a difference. \n\nTldr; I am back on my yolo shit boys. \n\n\nYa'll got any of them poorly written DD posts?",

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/labor-day-weekend-and-more-bullish)\n\n**TLDR:** stock market news sentiment remains significantly bullish for yet another week in a row, driven by optimistic monthly reports released for the month of August and continued upward trends from the SP500 and global cryptocurrency market.\n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nAs we commence our first week of Autumn 2021, stock market news remains just as bullish as it was to end the summer. News coverage this week was relatively unchanged in terms of sentiment compared to last week. Overall, the average finance article written this week scored a 0.35 in terms of sentiment (meaning that just over 1-in-3 sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically) and a 0.63 in terms of time-sense expressed (meaning that almost 2-in-3 sentences published this week were written in future tense). Here\u2019s a look at the major news events driving the continued all-time high bullish sentiment this past week:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Stocks: The major U.S. stock indexes traded in a narrow range all week, but the S&amp;P 500 managed to post a modest gain for the second week in a row.1 The NASDAQ outperformed its peers for the second consecutive week while the Dow fell slightly. Despite sustaining a mid-month decline, the S&amp;P 500 recovered to record its seventh positive month in a row, posting a return of about 3% in August. The index reached 12 record closing highs in the month versus 7 in July.\n\n\u20bf Cryptos: Much of this week\u2019s news optimism can be attributed to the continued meteoric rise in cryptocurrency prices. Global cryptocurrency market capitalization grew 11.5% this week to $2.4T dollars to cap off the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume. The majority of crypto-related headlines this week came on the back of Ethereum ($ETH) which rose more than 20% to $3,935.17 per coin this week at the time of this writing; other big crypto movers this week include Solana ($SOL) and Bitcoin ($BTC) as it eyes its first \u201cgolden cross\u201d since May 2020.\n\n\ud83e\udd85 Economy: While news optimism remains relatively high overall, time-sense fell slightly this week as a slew of monthly economic reports were released for the month of August. A private report showed that the U.S. economy recorded its 15th consecutive monthly gain in manufacturing activity in August. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index rose 0.4% to 59.9. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing activity. We also saw August\u2019s monthly job report this week. The economy generated 235,000 new jobs last month, far short of economists\u2019 expectations and trailing gains of nearly 1.1 million in July and 962,000 in June. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% in July.\n\n# 2. Most Mentioned Tickers \ud83d\udcca\n\nEach week we analyze the number of headlines written about each stock and cryptocurrency. The most mentioned tickers in this week\u2019s news and the tickers with the biggest volume increase compared to last week are shown here: [most mentioned tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d976bee-76fb-40f8-b7b7-1a97515e6ff3_1230x753.png)\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Apple ($AAPL): For the second consecutive week, $AAPL was mentioned more in news coverage than any other ticker in finance articles scraped this week. A mainstay of our weekly most-mentioned list, Apple Inc. churns news headlines, whether or not there\u2019s actually significant news to report about the company or its stock. Following the 10-year anniversary of Tim Cook\u2019s tenure as Apple CEO last week \u2014 as part of which he received $750M in $AAPL share value under the terms of his contract \u2014 headlines this week centered around an open letter written to Cook by Apple employees presenting a litany of grievances including concerns about privacy and diversity within the company. Apple also saw headlines from outside the workplace this week, as regulators from around the world mount pressure on the company\u2019s current App Store policy, accusing Apple of exerting too much control (ex. a 30% commission on in-app purchases) on developers who use it to sell products.\n\n\u201cWhat is Apple Thinking?\u201d | The New York Times\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 Automatic Data Processing Inc. ($ADP): The ticker with the biggest increase in news headlines this week compared to last week was $ADP. The stock fell a slight -0.86% last week and has now dropped nearly 3% over the past month to $207.38 per share as the company plans to go ex-dividend on September 9th. This means investors who purchase and settle shares of $ADP before this upcoming Thursday will be eligible to receive the company\u2019s $0.93 dividend payment per share, which will be paid out on October 1st. Automatic Data Processing\u2019s previous dividend payment consumed approximately 61% of the company\u2019s free cash flow last year, and while this is in the normal range for most dividend-paying organizations, analysts seem to agree that the decision bodes well for the company\u2019s long-term strategy by freeing up some space on their margins during a relatively lean period in its history as a business. Overall news sentiment for $ADP scored a +41.05% on a scale from -100% to +100%, signaling relatively bullish sentiment to boot over the past week.\n\n\u201cAutomatic Data Processing, Inc.

Sentiment Winners and Losers \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e\n\nEach week we summarize the most extreme sentiment scores in the news for each ticker to help you decide where to focus your attention. Here\u2019s a look at which tickers scored the highest (and lowest) in terms of optimism, pessimism, speculation, and reaction expressed in this past week\u2019s news: [most optimistic and pessimistic tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ce2ff0-9cf0-4d9e-b630-893857f80eee_2181x1305.png)\n\n# Sentiment: Most Optimistic\ud83d\ude00 and Pessimistic\ud83d\ude12 Tickers\n\n\ud83d\udcf6 Motorola Solutions Inc. ($MSI): This week\u2019s most optimistic stock in news coverage was Motorola Solutions Inc. (optimism score: 58.9%). $MSI stock rose a mere 0.76% on the week to build on 46.7% growth so far in 2021. Motorola Solutions \u2014 which succeeded Motorola, Inc., following the spinoff of the mobile phone division into Motorola Mobility in 2011 \u2014 has been spoken of with relatively good cheer compared to industry competitors like Qualcomm ($QCOM) and Verizon ($VZ). Much of the optimism has come as a revelation following the company\u2019s Q2 earnings released nearly a month ago on August 5th, in which the company revealed stratospheric annual earnings per share growth of 41% compound. While some may call it an old-fashioned investment in today\u2019s age of \u201ctech-stock blue sky investing\u201d, it\u2019s hard to argue with bonafide profitability like this if you\u2019re investing for the long-term. This week\u2019s most optimistic $MSI article:\n\n\u201cHere's Why I Think Motorola Solutions Is An Interesting Stock\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n\ud83d\udc15 Shiba Inu Coin ($SHIB): This week\u2019s most pessimistic (and reactive) ticker in news coverage was Shiba Inu Coin (pessimism score: 29.3%). Even though we saw relatively low amounts of pessimism in this week\u2019s news coverage across the board, $SHIB saw more pessimism expressed in articles this week than any other ticker, as the fringe cryptocurrency reached its lowest price of the past month on Tuesday (a whopping $0.000006735 per coin \u2014 yes, that\u2019s five zeroes after the decimal) as its developers announced that they\u2019d be removing a portion of the existing $SHIB supply from circulation. Though $SHIB price rose considerably heading into the weekend and continues to trend upwards at the time of this writing, it\u2019s still down 11% in value over the past month. Keep in mind that the coin \u2014 which was created in April as a blatant meme and borderline Ponzi scheme in response to the meteoric rise in the price of Dogecoin early this year \u2014 has grown 45x in value since its inception four months ago. In other words: a $1,000 investment in Shiba Inu Coin back in April is now worth somewhere around $42,000. This week\u2019s most pessimistic $SHIB article:\n\n\u201cHow the Shiba Inu Coin Burn is Attempting to Rekindle a Meme\u2019s Magic\u201d | Fast Company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Time-Sense: Most Speculative\ud83e\udd14\u23e9 and Reactive\ud83d\ude2e\u23ee\ufe0f Tickers: \n\nimage: [most speculative and reactive tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9219e3f-a6d0-4987-8b31-8e3d32fc3bfd_2203x1315.png)\n\n\ud83d\udd0b FirstEnergy Corp. ($FE): The stock with the most speculative (ie. future-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was FirstEnergy (speculation score: 95.4%). $FE stock 2.86% this week to $39.59 to cap a 34.16% run in share price year-to-date as the energy utility company has benefited from improving electricity demand in recent months. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. retail electricity sales are likely to inch up 2.7% in 2021 after sliding 3.9% in 2020. Given the growth in demand, coupled with FirstEnergy\u2019s 96.5% earnings growth this year and given that its stock is still trading 52.8% below its estimated fair value (according to Simply Wall St.), analysts speculate that its stock is set to remain a handsome mid- to long-term investment. Analysts also cite $FE\u2019s 14% return on equity (ROE) as a reassuring sign that the company is growing in value and effectively managing investors\u2019 money. This week\u2019s most speculative $FE article:\n\n\u201cShould You Be Excited About FirstEnergy Corp.'s 14% Return On Equity?\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udc5c PVH Corp. ($PVH): The stock with the most reactive (ie. past-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was PVH Corp. (reaction score: 53.6%). $PVH stock price stair-stepped up 5.12% to $118.84 per share on Wednesday following the release of its Q2 earnings report, which beat consensus analyst earnings and laid out an upbeat outlook for the remainder of the year. The company (formerly known as Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation) is one of the world\u2019s largest clothing conglomerates and owner/licenser of brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole New York, and Michael Kors. PVH Corp announced quarterly earnings per share of $2.72 \u2014 crushing analyst estimates $1.52 \u2014 and posted revenue growth of 46% YoY to $2.31 billion as consumers begin to return to their pre-pandemic apparel shopping habits. Following the beat-and-raise report, analysts at JPMorgan and Credit Suisse both announced increased price targets for $PVH. The most reactive $PVH article this week:\n\n\u201cPVH, IBD Stock Of Day, Breaks Out As Calvin Klein Owner's Earnings Beat\u201d | Investor\u2019s Business Daily\n\n# Biggest Mood Swings and Changes \ud83c\udfad\ud83d\udd00\n\nEach week we compare the sentiment of each ticker to its sentiment from the previous week. Presented below are the tickers that saw the biggest change in each of our four sentiment metrics this week compared to last: [image](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ffb0c2-1e95-4b38-b913-cf5a9e81061e_2038x769.png)\n\n\ud83d\udcbd Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week after $AMD stock broke resistance above $109 per share early in the week; analysts at Benzinga say the stock has now settled into its second bullish pattern of the past month. On Wednesday, it was reported the U.S. Department of Energy was nearing a deal worth $500 million to purchase a supercomputer made with AMD and NVIDIA Corp.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Coinbase Inc. ($COIN) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week despite the stock rallying 8.62% to $278.44 per share. This increase in pessimism can be widely attributed to a handful of contrarian, negative articles published by the likes of the Motley Fool and SeekingAlpha arguing that the underlying volatility of digital assets makes Coinbase an inherently risky stock to invest in.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Hewlett Packard Enterprises Co. ($HPE) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last as the stock remained relatively flat over the trading period, rising just 0.06% to $15.67 per share. Much of the speculation surrounding the company\u2019s lackluster earnings report released early in the week, in which the company\u2019s continued supply chain issues showed through. Analysts wonder if HP\u2019s component supply concerns will continue.\n\n\ud83d\udc89 Moderna Inc. ($MRNA) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed after increasing in stock price by more than 13% to $416.70 per share on strong trading volume and new research released this week suggesting that the company\u2019s COVID-19 shot may offer longer-lasting protection that Pfizer\u2019s amid growing conversation about the importance (or lack thereof) of booster shots.\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis past week brought a close to the month of August and commenced the unofficial start of Fall 2021. In terms of market action, August was the 7th consecutive month of stock market growth, and the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trade volume. This past week was no exception to the tremendous momentum in both realms, and news sentiment reflected this: stock market news articles published this week saw more optimism expressed on average than any other week this year except for one (the first week of August, the height of Q2 earnings).\n\nLooking ahead into September and October, the extreme optimism is showing no signs of slowing down as Wall Street expectations for the next stock market earnings season continue to rise. Over July and August, forecasts for third-quarter earnings of companies in the S&amp;P 500 rose 3.8%, according to FactSet. That\u2019s the fourth-largest such increase during the first two months of a quarter since 2009.\n\nWhile market bulls are currently reveling in the continued outperforms of stocks, market bears may be quick to point out that we are growing more and more due for some sort of correction. The S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t suffered a 5% pullback since October 2020. The last time the index experienced such a long period without a big drop was from June 2016 to early February 2018. With that in mind, we will continue to watch the progression of international economic factors like the COVID-19 Delta variant and the transition to Taliban rule in Afghanistan for any inkling of adverse impact on the U.S. stock market. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s report; good luck this week everyone, and thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude4f",

What does HIMAX make you ask? Money. Now I\u2019m no expert on money but what I do know is a deal when I see one. With a SP of under $11, a market cap of 1.8 billion and a PE of 8.5 HIMAX is literally fucking your wife as you read this. \n\n\nFrom what I gather HIMAX is a 10 inch player from 3 inch Taiwan.\n\n\nI will now copy/paste some shit I found on the internet to fill you in on what they do because I\u2019m too retarded to grasp it. This company is a sleeping giant, the price can 10x and it\u2019ll only be twice as large as it\u2019s direct competitor, Marvell, and be 10x less than AMD. \n\n\n\u201cHIMAX is a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used  in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and other consumer electronics devices. Additionally, it designs and provides controllers for touch sensor displays, in-cell Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions, LED driver ICs, power management ICs, scaler products for monitors and projectors, tailor-made video processing IC solution, silicon IPs and LCOS micro-displays for augmented reality (AR) devices and head-up displays (HUD) for automotive. Additional offers include digital camera solutions, including CMOS image sensors and wafer level optics for AR devices, 3D sensing and machine vision, which are used in a wide variety of applications such as mobile phone, tablet, laptop, TV, PC camera, automobile, security, medical devices, home appliance and Internet of Things\u201d. \n\n\nTVs \u2705 \nLaptops \u2705 \nMonitors \u2705 \nTablets \u2705 \nCellphones \u2705 \nCameras \u2705 \nCar navigation \u2705 \nVirtual reality \u2705 \n\n\nEverything your wife\u2019s boyfriend bought you most likely has HIMAX technology in it. On a scale of 1- I\u2019m a virgin HIMAX is a gangbang. Not only are they doing things I don\u2019t understand with everyday things like cellphones and TVs they are also doing it with AR and VR. VR is inevitably part of our future. Not only is the AR/VR segment not priced into HIMAX, the chip shortage is. This makes my penis harder than when you clean your wife\u2019s cream pie from a rando. \n\n\nIts not everyday you find a gem like this from a shitpost that doesn\u2019t belong to some intern from a hedge fund. \n\nPositions: 3k shares 50 dec 17 $13c.",

Having been raised in Las Vegas, I was taught to stay away from America's sin city, even though my dad worked in a Casino before. Growing up, I did. Now, I'm not trading or passing chips or cards around a table, I'm on comfortably on my phone, trading options, almost all-in style with CLOV, GME, BB, BABA(puts), APPL, F, TSLA, AMD, and a few others as my chips. I now know why this sub has coined the term \"FD\", oh boy, those chips are fucking delicious. I have been quite silent so far here, just observing, only to talk now that I, have earned almost $400 thousand dollars (accumulated), the most money in my life, in just 17 months of gambling (I don't do no research). Thanks to this sub for the meme stocks you created and more so, the trend setting you have put up for the stocks. I bought my dream car, a 2nd hand Porsche 911 Gt2, vacationing from Miami, to London, back to Cuba, Colombia,  As far as The Philippines, and Australia and getting pussy from all of those places more than I can ever drink. Sure, I'm not like the big shot celebrities to do those on the daily, but man, the experience of it is life-changing. These are the things I never thought would come to ever, as I was raised to stay away from taking risks. With that all said, fellow apes, Options are better than sex, Options are better than having a family, options, are life. Gambling, is the mind's greatest creation.",

        "selftext": "**CHIIIIIPPPPPPSSSSS - NOM NOM**\n\nGood morning ladies and gents.  Lets talk about chips - semiconductors to be exact.  If you have tried to purchase a car or refrigerator in the past few months you've noticed that either the price has increased or they are on backorder.  \n\nUnfortunately, everything from your car's dashboard to your dragon shaped dildo now requires a computer chip.  Because of this all this, the semiconductor/chip stocks have been shooting straight up (**AMD, TSM, NVDA**).  Their valuations are high, but this is rightfully so since the semiconductor shortage is theoretically going to last until 2023 according to analysts (1).  This is where **HIMX** enters the building.\n\n**HIMX** is a fabless semiconductor provider.  They create a multitude of design solutions for visual displays (TV's, Laptops, mobile phones, car navigation, VR devices) as well as a whole host of additional products such as silicon IP's and LCOS micro displays for automotive HUD.   The company is based in Taiwan, and has been chugging along during the pandemic, increasing their quarterly revenue growth by an impressive 95.5% yoy.  It's quarterly earnings have beaten expectations during the last two quarters, but due to the China FUD and being located in Taiwan it's become risky for investors.  \n\n**BEARISH POINTS**\n\nSo let me lay out the bear case before I start pumping the bull argument.  There is a legitimate fear that China will eventually completely control Taiwan and impose the same tariffs that already exist for mainland China.  This would drastically hurt business with the West, from which HIMX draws a large portion of it's customer base.   Taiwan's position is that as long as they keep making semiconductors, they are important to the West, and we will protect them.  At the moment, that's still the case, and looks like that will continue to be the case for the next few years.\n\nFrom a technical aspect this company is being shorted heavily.  The put/call ratio is 1.34, the short interest on Aug 13th was 10.35%, and the short ratio everyday since Aug 13th has increased dramatically. \n\nSo if you think China doesn't plan to start WWIII, please keep reading.  \n\n**BULLISH POINTS**\n\nThe bullish argument is that you have a company creating a product that is in high demand, and will continue to be in high demand in the near future.  **TSM** has raised the prices of their semiconductors by 10% within the past month, it's likely that **HIMX** will follow suit.  There are two opportunities for them to make this announcement within this week: Sept 6-7th dbAccess IAA Cars Virtual Conference 2021 and Sept 6-10th 22nd Credit Suisse Asian Technology Conference (2).  \n\nWhen **HIMX** P/E is compared to other semiconductor stocks, it's much lower (Trailing P/E 9.94 vs. 32.55 for **TSM**).  Within the past month the price action has pushed **HIMX** back down to the 200SMA, which it has been grinding along for the past week.  The price action appears to be consolidating against the 200SMA which suggests a big move in either direction.  According to FinTel the short borrow fee rate jumped from 0.7% to 1.86% on Sep 3rd.  The number of shares available to borrow has been steadily decreasing within the past two weeks while the price has begun to stagnate.  It appears HIMX is going to make a decent sized move soon, and with analysts suggesting a low PT of 19 and high 23.50, it's only a matter of time until this puppy pops (3).  \n\nPositions:\n\n[40x $13 10/15 calls](https://imgur.com/a/Nc296SF)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) [Chip shortage could last into 2023, says car boss (BBC)](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58465954) \n\n2) [HIMX Event Calendar](https://www.himax.com.tw/investors/event-calendar/)\n\n3) [HIMX - CNN Forecast](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=HIMX)",

        "selftext": "This is in no way financial advice. I'm merely informing any potential readers about some of the less obvious things I've learned that turned out to be \"profitable knowledge.\" \n\nHowever, being as I'm a small sample-size, it's impossible to determine whether or not this knowledge is actually inherently sound/true, or is it just luck / happenstance? Consequently, this cannot be considered factual. \n\n1.) Trade what you, as a consumer, find value in. Every American Adult is an expert consumer, to varying degrees. It comes with the territory. If you find a (preferably new) product or service that is clearly doing something superior in comparison to it's competitors, chances are, others will notice this too. Eventually, this should reflect in the stock price. \n\n2.) Create a watch-list. These should be companies you are VERY familiar with. What do they provide to their consumers? Who is their CEO? How many employees do they have? Have you looked at their income statements? Can you find trends in their share price? \n\n2.5.) Keep adding companies to your watch-list. \n\n3.) Knowledge that doesn't DIRECTLY PERTAIN to the stock-market is often the most valuable knowledge. For example, 3-4 years ago, any person who understands basic computer jargon (CPU, GPU, Benchmarks, etc) could tell you that AMD was TOTALLY changing the paradigm in CPU development for PC's. \nLast year, any person who pays for gyms &amp; tanning salons could recognize that Planet Fitness memberships are incredibly value-centric. \nMy point is this: reading the Wall Street Journal, or watching traders on Youtube, this is fine &amp; dandy, but, often to truly understand a market, you need to have a VERY GOOD understanding of the service or product they provide. \nLet's say you're contemplating investing in a Shipping Company who specializes in Over-Seas &amp; Heavy-Load hauling. \nDon't ask some trader or broker if it's a good investment. \nFind a commercial Boat Captain. \n\n4.) (This one I hate) When I first contemplated trading, I assumed that the catalyst for most share price moves were recently acquired revenue streams, new services &amp; products, etc.   \nHowever, as I've come to realize, The Market is more akin to a sewing circle than an actual reflection of the companies it is comprised of. Specifically speaking: The perception of potential is, somehow, far more appealing to most investors than the revenue of today.  \n\nIf anyone is seriously interested in more of the things I've learned, let me know, I just don't want to keep writing if nobody cares. \nI enjoy helping people. Gives me that white magic. \n:P",

The CRM stock was from the result of Slack acquisition. \n\nFor Intel, I'm waiting to see how their big.Little CPUs and ARC GPUs will perform in reviews. If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.\n\nFor Qualcomm, I'm betting that their Nuvia acquisition will allow them to move into the laptop/desktop market but it's a small bet right now. Again, I will wait for reviews of their first Nuvia product before deciding if I want to buy more because of the lag between reviews and Wallstreet reacting.\n\nSo far, I've beaten S&amp;P500 last year and this year so far.",

In the long term always seems to keep up with the pace of new tech and has solid workforce and at least since they dropped Bannon, management is on point\n\nAMZN- Absolute monster. Hard to not want it in my line up. They will continue to grow and buy up/absorb new tech and not afraid to buy up the little guy to increase their market share.\n\nAMD- I like them for the fact that their tech has been setting the bar as of late. While Intel or Nvidia might be bigger and have more market share, i think AMD has more potential over a long term.\n\nHD- I like the grasp on the non tech market they have. They do well during economic growth. They sustain during economic lulls. And even though I'm a Lowes guy, they are the workhorse in household consumer goods and building materials.\n\nBA- Chose this over an airline because it moves with the same news, but is tied in closely with US Military spending and  will sustain over times of peace and war.\n\nNote: Honestly i invest 70ish% in funds. And only about 25% of my portfolio is in blue chips. But thought it'd be fun to see what people choose and they're reasoning.",

I invested $1000 into NVDA right before earnings so I'm doing pretty great so far.\n\nBut what should my next investment be? I was thinking TSM, AMD, ASML and AMAT. Which one would you recommend long term? I'm thinking about investing $200 a month since that is what I earn on my job.

        "selftext": "Hey retards, \n\nso ending normal funnies and jokes- here\u2019s something that you all will need to understand and hopefully help you on your tax understanding. \n\nNow it won\u2019t be much fun to read it but knowing it may be helpful to you at some point.\n\n1) what is wash sale rule? \n\n&gt;A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar.\n\nNow the actual way to understanding this is kind of complex and even out of the scope of this post. You can be held at a tax higher than your gain (some retard got a 800k tax bill in a 40k gain because of wash sale rule since he was trading same stocks 10+ times a day). \n\nBut do know that this rule, is made to stop shady things. It usually won\u2019t effect you because brokerages are smart enough to realize it and do mathematical calculation to your second buy to fix the wash sale rule instantly. But there can be mistakes. \n\nNOTE: you should only be paying taxes on your actual gain and deducting from your all losses (total after net year). If anything is wrong, see tax accountant instantly. \n\n2)  tax-loss harvesting\n\nThis is like algebra math where you try to add and subtract to get the best number. Say you have 2 positions, one in AMD and one in GME. You realized a gain (so you closed your position) on AMD but still have your GME options chugging along. Your GME options don\u2019t expire until next year but they are in loss. It\u2019s December- so you say \u201cwait, rather than pay full tax on my gains from AMD, why don\u2019t I close my GME positions for a loss and now I can subtract that loss from my AMD gain and pay less tax\u201d. \n\n3) deduction of capital loss\n\nYou say you have -20k realized loss in 2020. You can deduct 3000$ from your earned income every year until that 20k is used up. This means you lost 20k in stocks but made 60k in your job- you can automatically deduct 3000 from your income so now you effectively have a 57,000$ income for tax. \n\nNow some people are confused but this is only for EARNED INCOME. The 3000 deduction limit is so it\u2019s not abused. But say you have 2021 capital gain from GME of 15k. \n\nHere if you still had -20k loss of 2020, you can deduct the full 15k gain from 2021 so that -20k loss now is at 5k loss and use the remaining 3000 from 5k to deduct the earned income (from job) of 2021. For a total net loss of -2k still left for next year. \n\n4) positions that you hold for less than 1 year will be taxed at higher % than positions held more than year. \n\nThere are more Things like Tax-optimized Portfolio and many other tax implication that are too far out of reach for a single post but be aware of all these things. \n\nSPY 460c 9/10- free money",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CHIIIIIPPPPPPSSSSS - NOM NOM**\n\nGood morning ladies and gents. Lets talk about chips - semiconductors to be exact. If you have tried to purchase a car or refrigerator in the past few months you've noticed that either the price has increased or they are on backorder.\n\nUnfortunately, everything from your car's dashboard to your dragon shaped dildo now requires a computer chip. Because of this all this, the semiconductor/chip stocks have been shooting straight up (**AMD, TSM, NVDA**). Their valuations are high, but this is rightfully so since the semiconductor shortage is theoretically going to last until 2023 according to analysts (1). This is where **HIMX** enters the building.\n\n**HIMX** is a fabless semiconductor provider. They create a multitude of design solutions for visual displays (TV's, Laptops, mobile phones, car navigation, VR devices) as well as a whole host of additional products such as silicon IP's and LCOS micro displays for automotive HUD. The company is based in Taiwan, and has been chugging along during the pandemic, increasing their quarterly revenue growth by an impressive 95.5% yoy. It's quarterly earnings have beaten expectations during the last two quarters, but due to the China FUD and being located in Taiwan it's become risky for investors.\n\n**BEARISH POINTS**\n\nSo let me lay out the bear case before I start pumping the bull argument. There is a legitimate fear that China will eventually completely control Taiwan and impose the same tariffs that already exist for mainland China. This would drastically hurt business with the West, from which HIMX draws a large portion of it's customer base. Taiwan's position is that as long as they keep making semiconductors, they are important to the West, and we will protect them. At the moment, that's still the case, and looks like that will continue to be the case for the next few years.\n\nFrom a technical aspect this company is being shorted heavily. The put/call ratio is 1.34, the short interest on Aug 13th was 10.35%, and the short ratio everyday since Aug 13th has increased dramatically.\n\nSo if you think China doesn't plan to start WWIII, please keep reading.\n\n**BULLISH POINTS**\n\nThe bullish argument is that you have a company creating a product that is in high demand, and will continue to be in high demand in the near future. **TSM** has raised the prices of their semiconductors by 10% within the past month, it's likely that **HIMX** will follow suit. There are two opportunities for them to make this announcement within this week: Sept 6-7th dbAccess IAA Cars Virtual Conference 2021 and Sept 6-10th 22nd Credit Suisse Asian Technology Conference (2).\n\nWhen **HIMX** P/E is compared to other semiconductor stocks, it's much lower (Trailing P/E 9.94 vs. 32.55 for **TSM**). Within the past month the price action has pushed **HIMX** back down to the 200SMA, which it has been grinding along for the past week. The price action appears to be consolidating against the 200SMA which suggests a big move in either direction. According to FinTel the short borrow fee rate jumped from 0.7% to 1.86% on Sep 3rd. The number of shares available to borrow has been steadily decreasing within the past two weeks while the price has begun to stagnate. It appears HIMX is going to make a decent sized move soon, and with analysts suggesting a low PT of 19 and high 23.50, it's only a matter of time until this puppy pops (3).\n\nPositions:\n\n40x $13 10/15\n\nI had references to the little numbers in parenthesis, but WSB hates links, so I'm going to see if this gets through then I'll post them in the comments.  Along with my position pic.",

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Listen Apes. I know all of our tendies are being eaten by the big bad MM\u2019s and institutions, but I have a theory.\n\nThere is a reason normal stocks that are shorted do not usually exceed 100% short interest. Don\u2019t ask me the mechanics behind it, but I think this is something we can all agree on - just look at AMD, GE, and several other companies that have historically been on the brink of collapse. The events in which SI exceeds 100% are exceptional conditions, such as the case we have with TMC. \n\nWhile the reported short interest on TMC is not over 100%, between it being a delayed metric reported to the market and the fact that we can ALL AGREE with the low float and enormous Reddit volume to the buy side, that SI must be well in excess of 100%. Maybe well upward of 300%. I do not know how these shares are still borrowable at this point, but the shorts must be using synthetic shares and complex derivative agreements to keep up this selling pressure.\n\nWhat I think we can also ALL AGREE on is that there is a give and take to any type of strategy in the stonk market.\n\nWith the SI (I am speculating) in excess of 300% through the use of god-knows-what mechanisms employed by the MM\u2019s and institutions, combined with the fact that stonks actually shorted for the true intention of riding them down towards bankruptcy never exceed 100% of short interest, I think it likely that most of this SI activity will have to cover Monday or early next week. \n\nIf it were profitable to short every stock and make money with SI this high, it would happen more often but it does not. The MM\u2019s in our TMC scenario are not making money by driving the price down to this extent off shares. The money they are making is off the OTM options contracts to expire worthless. THIS profit off the options is worth MORE than the cost of the shares they are shorting. Not the ACTUAL cost of borrowing the shares, but manipulating the price beyond what is practical. \n\nWe see this with normal MM activity in any other stock. All those textbook resistance and support points you\u2019ve learned? The MM\u2019s smash through them by pennies most of the time to trigger stops and additional buying and selling that allows them to scoop shares cheap, drive the price back up, and sell them. This is only profitable if employed within reason. To do this with the purpose of gaining ABSOLUTE CONTROL over the share price means that the MM is incurring losses to do so.\n\nWhat does this have to do with TMC? Absolute control and synthetic short interest must come at a cost. This cost is lower than fulfilling all of the OI on ITM calls, which is why we are seeing it occur. MM\u2019s are loaded with short shares that are not economically profitable to buy back (as soon as they start to cover, the price rises like a chain reaction). They have exceeded the \u201cnatural equilibrium\u201d of how much price control they can obtain without taking on unadvantageous and unprofitable positions on these shares. I also theoreticize that through whatever synthetic shares/complex derivative agreements allow them to create such a large SI, most of these must be unwound very soon as they are not normal shorting transactions. \n\nHow can we still beat the MM\u2019s and institutions stealing our tendies in round 1 of our TMC fight? These synthetic shorts must be covered, and SOON. While they have had significant influence over the price of TMC today (Friday 9/17), it comes at the cost of price action to occur next week when they must cover. Think of the stock price like a trampoline - you can push down on it from the top or push up from the bottom, but as soon as you remove your hand it is back to  equilibrium. I think the MM\u2019s have offset equilibrium with this extreme control over downward price action, but when they are forced to cover (and they will be) TMC will begin trading up and equilibrium will be restored. \n\nI also think it is possible that multiple MM\u2019s/institutions could have competing interests, where it is profitable to be the first one to cover as opposed to the last. This hypothesis, if correct, could also create a chain reaction of sorts that drives the price back up next week. \n\nIn short:\n1. We can agree SI is higher than what is stated, maybe over 300%\n2. A stock shorted with intentions of actually riding it down to zero will not exceed 100% as bankruptcy approaches\n3. Complete and total pricing control comes at a cost, and equilibrium will be restored\n4. Points 1-3 are why TMC\u2019s price should increase\n5. I further speculate that the synthetic nature of these shorts could require them to be covered sooner than a normal shorting transaction (hopefully next week); and that there is incentive as a MM to be the first one to cover as opposed to the last. \n\nTakeaway? Don\u2019t panic today, if you\u2019re still holding shares it might be worth seeing what happens early next week. ALSO just looking at the closing price today and previous highs this week, it seems normal a little bit of mean reversion should occur and raise the price.",

It massively rallied from end of July to early August (the pole of the pennant) and since then has consolidated with lower highs and higher lows (the actual pennant). Moreover, volume has decreased since the rally, and the RSI 14 indicates the stock is reaching oversold territory, which could be signs of consolidation. Also, the price has been hanging around the EMA 50, which could mean we could see this level become a support if a breakout from the consolidation were to happen.

        "selftext": "First of all, is there an easy way to look this up? I'd like to know what percent a company is away from their ATH, I can of course do some maths to find out, but who wants to do maths?\n\nAnyways, two that spring to mind for me are **AMD** and **QCOM**. AMD's ATH is $122.49. It closed today at $106.15. It's a bit over 13 percent below it's ATH. QCOM's ATH is $167.94. It closed today at $141.58  It's about 15.7 percent below it's ATH.\n\nSo, if you imagine that AMD or Qualcomm will hit a new ATH in the next six months, it might be worth it to jump in there for a quick 13 or 16 percent, respectively.\n\nDo you know of any other solid tech stocks that have real products, real management and a proven track record that are similar to these two?\n\nNote: I don't own any shares in AMD or QCOM at this time",

        "selftext": "Redbubble is an ASX-Listed online marketplace for independent artists that provides printed products. Here was there recent investor presentation. Most of their customers are based in North America amd Europe. They are currently heavily undervalued at around $1.1B AUD ($800M USD).\n\nhttps://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02408798-3A573176?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4\n\nThe company currently has aggressive plans to grow their revenue to $1.5B AUD by 2024, afterwards focusing more efforts on raising margins. Their CAGR for the past 5 years has been 41% on average. Guidance until 2024 is around 20-30% CAGR. Their current revenue is around $657M AUD with a gross profit of $223M AUD. \n\nHere are some of their key selling points. \n\nTheir business is being pushed by 3 key trends: a) they are an emerging winner in a rapidly shifting landscape (personalisation of e-commerce goods), b) this is reinforcing the inherent flywheel (network) effects and c) the shift to e-commerce and online has been accelerated by COVID - this is a structural change, we aren't going back\n\nThey have a very strong balance sheet and a nice cash buffer ($99M). They are cash flow positive, generating $51M EBITDA for FY21. \n\nThe valuation multiple is still extremely low and enticing at circa 2x MP revenue, compared to comparators at 10x revenue or more. \n\nI want to emphasise the comparison between Etsy here because their business model is inherently similar, utilizing the incredibly rare flywheel effect between artists and customers. Their growth rate is also very similar. At current revenue, my estimates would put them at 3-4 years behind Etsy. \n\nEtsy Revenue (USD)\n\n2015 - 273M \n2016 - 364M\n2017 - 441M\n2018 - 603M\n2019 - 818M\n2020 - 1.7B\n\nRedbubble Revenue (AUD). \n\n2019 - 306M\n2020 - 416M\n2021 - 657M\n2024 - 1.5B Target\n\nEtsy's has appreciated 25x over the past 4-5 years. Not only did Etsy's valuation increase with its revenues, but also its revenue multiple too. The current difference in valuation between Etsy and RBL is around 37x. \n\nMostly because RBL is listed on the ASX and relatively unknown globally (yet). Also because Australian funds are typically value investors. OTCMKTS is RDBBY. \n\nThe Australian Tech scene is actually fairly well developed with Atlassian, Afterpay and Xero. Redbubble is shaping up to be the next giant, currently with a very attractive valuation that could yield significant returns in the upcoming years as they start to get noticed by the big NASDAQ players.",

strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

The alligator indicator is still open (spread out, like your wife after Godzilla's bit run) but that's not predictive of direction, and we'll see why in a later chart.  \n\n\nThe suggestion here is that while volume lost some steam later in the day, there's still some juice in the tank according to this run, even though it's overly stretched.\n\n# \n\n# What does MDB's history tell us about behavior around earnings and big swing pattern?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB historical earnings and Fibonacci ranges 1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/cqe62t0voyl71.png?width=1827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=715f2387eee85784a2af62a4a75aa531cc7b71a2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMDB moves significantly around earnings catalysts, essentially amplifying prior trends lately. In the past 3 earnings patterns, what we see is a Fibonacci relationship starting from the pre-earnings trend. In the two upswings, what we see if you track the entire pattern, making 0 level your earnings date, what we get is significance around the 1.618 and 2.618 fib retracement zones. On the decline, we bounce off the 1.618 and return to the 0 line before generating a new fractal direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese tends last for about 2 months, with most of the change happening during the latter half of the period. This suggests broadly that the pattern for these catalysts with the stock is to amplify existing trends until they play out their directional dynamics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this earnings report response is drastically different... we didn't hit the 2.618 over the span of a few weeks from the 0 line... we did it in 1 day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This has to be the definition of a rocket](https://preview.redd.it/swcwm05rqyl71.png?width=1815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a709541bdefa3cc26d18e8c600f8b38f6f2a4bbf)\n\nWhile historical trends might suggest this means the run is over, and it very well may be. There are definitely some reversal candles in the prior charts and some bouncing around in the space between 2.618 and 0, but each one eventually bounces down to t he 1.618 range. \n\nSince this was exaggerated, though, I don't know that the old Fibonacci relationship matters anymore. This could very well break the 2.618 tomorrow on a squeeze dynamic and then all bets are off as to where it could stop. \n\nThe proof will be in the early day trade, I think. If it runs very early in the trading session, that could very well be a sign of a continuing squeeze in motion. If it doesn't, I'm looking at a target in the 1.618 range just below $450. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Can we learn anything else from these technicals about how the stock trades and what signals we can possibly use? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB 1 year chart 9-6-2021 Fractals, Alligator moving averages, VWMA crossover](https://preview.redd.it/mtsw9x8rryl71.png?width=1821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c67a2d9482dcbfab300c0fcb40865dd1242d59b1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the one year chart, the VWMA (Volume Weighted Moving Average) appears to be predictive on big movement around catalysts. I've marked all of the points where it converges on big moves where put/call trades would have been profitable around a catalyst/predictable big trend change had we used them as buy/sell signals. Of course, these are not perfectly predictive in all circumstances, so supplement any moves with knowledge of catalysts and other externals that you might have available, but currently the VWMA has not crossed over to a sell-off signal yet. It's flirting with it on the Monthly chart, and the intra-day signals are crossed over back and forth but aren't really applicable to the larger trend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis could be a statistical anomaly, but it could also be evidence that there's still room for the stock to run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# If the run were to continue, how would it happen?\n\nMDB, compared to other tech stocks, is a stock with a very low liquid float. Unlike AMD, which has a float of 1.21B, MDB's float is only around 60M once you account for insiders locked into the open shares statistic. It also sports an almost 89% institutional ownership position:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/v7j1wq7dtyl71.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e1bb1043cfa0d83b4632b8fe0af19fbb0a3e8ff)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVolume is traditionally EXTREMELY low:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB volume history](https://preview.redd.it/xz3q120ityl71.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d66229d85d91495a51e8c1a10b172340030648)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe options chain for this week was much higher than normal as a result of the activity, and increased significantly over the span of just a couple of days:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB 9-3 options chain](https://preview.redd.it/diycy8ymtyl71.png?width=1311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fd5f85db9259115d4041abf96f9a8c861a5809a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile the impact of options chains in gamma squeezes is somewhat controversial since a large percentage of the shares will be covered calls, there's an open question about delta hedging and cash-backed call selling by market makers and institutionals which is central to calls and short covering. Basically, if you have a stock like MDB which is shooting WAY up in a short period of time, the best way to cover yourself is to buy stock so that the value of the stock rides up and you're left with less cost once the stock levels out at the top.\n\nThe most simple method of doing this is a 100% stock-covered call, which most low-level traders have to do because of how their brokers operate. \n\nThat's inefficient, though, since the delta on any one short call may start out more like the .3-.5 range depending on volatility, etc... so more advanced traders don't fully cover a call, they delta hedge by buying only the shares to cover the delta and flex up as needed.  \n\n\nBut delta on all of these calls would have increased insanely fast as they all wound up ITM, and the cover would have been necessary during the run-up OR after the fact if it continues to run up. What anyone who hasn't covered right now is probably looking for is a nice even plateau with a sign of upward motion to buy in to limit losses, or a decline in the price to limit losses.\n\nSpeaking of short interest, here's the short interest in the MDB:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MDB short interest](https://preview.redd.it/epif7wt5vyl71.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=774f7cc53ca46c1708d01637ff41ae11a0761d74)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost other sites have it around the 9-million mark, give or take.\n\nAdd this all up and what do you get?  \n\n\nA 6 million volume day which increased the stock price by 26%, against a float which is almost 90% owned by institutions, with a short interest which the latest figures suggest is close to 9%, and an options market which is usually small for the stock essentially exploding in value and volume. Any positive movement with this small liquid float is going to increase the dynamic, forcing cover by any entities that haven't yet covered to consider hedging. If this runs up in the morning, it could continue to increase as the available float reduces.  \n\n\nOf course, since institutions own most of the float, they may be tempted to sell to shape the price for ideal cover if they have exposure, so that may result in a structured sell-off, but the difference between the short interest and institutional ownership suggests greater potential upside from the stock's price increase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a result, all technicals suggesting a top aside, my bias is towards a continuing upside.\n\nSince I can't be sure of that upside, I'm currently running a strangle on the stock to see where it goes.\n\n# Positions:\n\n450p/550c exp 9/10\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[450p](https://preview.redd.it/24nv91rxwyl71.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db51147a333d85d33df52070a2e2cde97282e822)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[550c](https://preview.redd.it/qnlq2buywyl71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecd1ce1e77b8d5e793dbd2f87a80e79aa413888d)",

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Redbubble is an ASX-Listed online marketplace for independent artists that provides printed products. Here was there recent investor presentation. Most of their customers are based in North America amd Europe. They are currently heavily undervalued at around $1.1B AUD ($800M USD).\n\nhttps://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02408798-3A573176?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4\n\nThe company currently has aggressive plans to grow their revenue to $1.5B AUD by 2024, afterwards focusing more efforts on raising margins. Their CAGR for the past 5 years has been 41% on average. Guidance until 2024 is around 20-30% CAGR. Their current revenue is around $657M AUD with a gross profit of $223M AUD. \n\nHere are some of their key selling points. \n\nTheir business is being pushed by 3 key trends: a) they are an emerging winner in a rapidly shifting landscape (personalisation of e-commerce goods), b) this is reinforcing the inherent flywheel (network) effects and c) the shift to e-commerce and online has been accelerated by COVID - this is a structural change, we aren't going back\n\nThey have a very strong balance sheet and a nice cash buffer ($99M). They are cash flow positive, generating $51M EBITDA for FY21. \n\nThe valuation multiple is still extremely low and enticing at circa 2x MP revenue, compared to comparators at 10x revenue or more. \n\nI want to emphasise the comparison between Etsy here because their business model is inherently similar, utilizing the incredibly rare flywheel effect between artists and customers. Their growth rate is also very similar. At current revenue, my estimates would put them at 3-4 years behind Etsy. \n\nEtsy Revenue (USD)\n\n2015 - 273M \n2016 - 364M\n2017 - 441M\n2018 - 603M\n2019 - 818M\n2020 - 1.7B\n\nRedbubble Revenue (AUD). \n\n2019 - 306M\n2020 - 416M\n2021 - 657M\n2024 - 1.5B Target\n\nEtsy's has appreciated 25x over the past 4-5 years. Not only did Etsy's valuation increase with its revenues, but also its revenue multiple too. The current difference in valuation between Etsy and RBL is around 37x. \n\nMostly because RBL is listed on the ASX and relatively unknown globally (yet). Also because Australian funds are typically value investors. OTCMKTS is RDBBY. \n\nThe Australian Tech scene is actually fairly well developed with Atlassian, Afterpay and Xero. Redbubble is shaping up to be the next giant, currently with a very attractive valuation that could yield significant returns in the upcoming years as they start to get noticed by the big NASDAQ players.",

        "selftext": "Seeing if anyone would be willing to give some (non financial) advice on options strategies, how to find potential plays, what you guys look for, etc. I only have about 2k to play with and pretty new and so far have been scalping 20-30% gainers on options that I\u2019ve bought that same day or day before like AMD 105c last week, GOEV 7.50 and 8.50c and NKE puts. Every once in a while I\u2019ll get lucky and catch a 100%+ gainer but more often than not my stop losses trigger at -20% cause my balls aren\u2019t big enough to ride it down to -99% and wait for a reversal.

Their core recommendations have outperformed the market for me.  I mean, I get it... they don't return 1,000% in 10 days on a squeeze.  But they never claimed to be that company.

        "selftext": "\nI\u2019ve been on hiatus because I\u2019ve had real life shit to deal with like which video to upload on Onlyfans because I\u2019ve been fucking all your wives but let\u2019s get to the topic at hand. \n\nHIMAX is undervalued and the best part is that the chip shortage is priced in. What does HIMAX make you ask? Money. Now I\u2019m no expert on money but what I do know is a deal when I see one. With a SP of under $11, a market cap of 1.8 billion and a PE of 8.5 HIMAX is literally fucking your wife as you read this. \n\n\nFrom what I gather HIMAX is a 10 inch player from 3 inch Taiwan.\n\n\nI will now copy/paste some shit I found on the internet to fill you in on what they do because I\u2019m too retarded to grasp it. This company is a sleeping giant, the price can 10x and it\u2019ll only be twice as large as it\u2019s direct competitor, Marvell, and be 10x less than AMD. \n\n\n\u201cHIMAX is a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used  in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and other consumer electronics devices. Additionally, it designs and provides controllers for touch sensor displays, in-cell Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions, LED driver ICs, power management ICs, scaler products for monitors and projectors, tailor-made video processing IC solution, silicon IPs and LCOS micro-displays for augmented reality (AR) devices and head-up displays (HUD) for automotive. Additional offers include digital camera solutions, including CMOS image sensors and wafer level optics for AR devices, 3D sensing and machine vision, which are used in a wide variety of applications such as mobile phone, tablet, laptop, TV, PC camera, automobile, security, medical devices, home appliance and Internet of Things\u201d. \n\n\nTVs \u2705 \nLaptops \u2705 \nMonitors \u2705 \nTablets \u2705 \nCellphones \u2705 \nCameras \u2705 \nCar navigation \u2705 \nVirtual reality \u2705 \n\n\nEverything your wife\u2019s boyfriend bought you most likely has HIMAX technology in it. On a scale of 1- I\u2019m a virgin HIMAX is a horse gangbang. Not only are they doing things I don\u2019t understand with everyday things like cellphones and TVs they are also doing it with AR and VR. VR is inevitably part of our future. Not only is the AR/VR segment not priced into HIMAX, the chip shortage is. This makes my penis harder than when you clean your wife\u2019s creampie from a rando. \n\n\nIts not everyday you find a gem like this from a shitpost that doesn\u2019t belong to some intern from a hedge fund. \n\nPositions: 3k shares 50 dec 17 $13c.",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone. I hope you had a nice weekend, and let's get back at it today. Lots of stocks gapping down this morning, things could get interesting. Make sure to stay disciplined, I'll be cautious today.\n\n*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.\n\n**Main Watchlist:**\n\nGapping UP:\n\n* AVIR\n* BRKS\n* UVXY\n\nGapping DOWN:\n\n* TSLA\n* BABA\n* NIO\n* BA\n* UAL\n* AMD\n* PUK\n* CLF\n* AMC\n\n**Market Outlook:**\n\nStocks are looking to open lower this morning after some choppiness in last week's sessions. The Fed is set to hold its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, and we could be getting an indicator as to when the Fed will taper its asset purchase program. US Treasury Secretary called for Congress to raise the US debt ceiling, and that failing to do so would generate \"widespread economic catastrophe\". There are also concerns that Chinese Evergrande Group, a Chinese real estate juggernaut, could collapse because of major debt. Shares were down more than 10% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Adding to the fear is the broader crackdown on real estate by the Chinese government; this situation is worth monitoring, as it could have effects on the overall market. Worth watching UVXY if we continue to see fear in the market.\u00a0\n\nSPY is currently trading a bit under 434, and if we see more weakness we could test the SMA(100) as support at \\~432. We'll see what things look like closer to open, but regardless, we should see some volatility today. DIA is trading just under 339, after breaking down below the SMA(100) in last week's trading. We could see a retrace to the \\~332 level by the SMA(200) if we continue to see weakness. Potential support levels at 337 and 335, so we could see a bounce. QQQ\u00a0is trading a bit under 367 and is currently gapping down below the SMA(50). 370 will now be a key resistance point, and we could be in for a bigger correction if we can't get back above that 370 level today. Gold and silver are up a bit this morning, while crude oil is pulling back. Crude oil is currently hovering right around $70 per barrel, we'll see if that holds up. B\\*\\*coin is currently trading around 42,800 and things are looking bearish at the moment. Unless we see a strong bounce off support at these levels, we could see more selling off in the near future. Cr\\*\\*to-related stocks are down in premarket trading, as a result. Airlines and cruise stocks are down this morning. It will be worth watching to see if we bounce off support levels sometime this morning, or continue to see weakness. Meme stocks are showing weakness at the moment, but worth keeping on the radar.\u00a0\n\nRemember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",

It is in our very nature as humans to take risk sometimes for that ultimate return of maximum reward. Having been raised in Las Vegas, I was taught to stay away from America's sin city, even though my dad worked in a Casino before. Growing up, I did. Now, I'm not trading or passing chips or cards around a table, I'm on comfortably on my phone, trading options, almost all-in style with CLOV, GME, BB, BABA(puts), APPL, F, TSLA, AMD, and a few others as my chips. I now know why this sub has coined the term \"FD\", oh boy, those chips are fucking delicious. I have been quite silent so far here, just observing, only to talk now that I, have earned almost $400 thousand dollars (accumulated), the most money in my life, in just 17 months of gambling (I don't do no research). Thanks to this sub for the meme stocks you created and more so, the trend setting you have put up for the stocks. I bought my dream car, a 2nd hand Porsche 911 Gt2, vacationing from Miami, to London, back to Cuba, Colombia, As far as The Philippines, and Australia and getting pussy from all of those places more than I can ever drink. Sure, I'm not like the big shot celebrities to do those on the daily, but man, the experience of it is life-changing. These are the things I never thought would come to ever, as I was raised to stay away from taking risks. With that all said, fellow apes, Options are better than sex, Options are better than having a family, options, are life. Gambling, is the mind's greatest creation.",

        "selftext": "All of my recent options plays have gone to shit. In large part because I put zero effort into research anymore. See stock going down, buy deep otm weekly calls on said stock, stare at charts and watch myself lose money for about 15 minutes. Get mad that I'm losing money. Close robinhood. \n\nA couple hours later I'll be busy doing something else and I'll randomly remember to check robinhood. Instantly my heart starts racing and I frantically grab my phone, open up robinhood. If my position is deep in the red I stare at charts for a minute or two, take some extra strength black tar copium, accept the fact I will lose all of that money, and close robinhood again. \n\nIn the rare occasion that the position is deep in the green, I exhale a sigh of relief, stare at charts for 10 minutes, get nervous as I watch the stock start to tank, continue staring at the chart as half of my gains disappear, sell my options so I can relax and enjoy the rest of my day without distractions. \n\nI had finally decided I was done with this roller coaster ride. I started to think \"You know what, I've lost a lot of money on options, but I'm fine with it. I'm still doing well. I'm just going to stop playing with them, since they aren't helping me gain money, and I'm just going to focus on work.\" \n\n\nThere was still a part of me that wanted to play with options though so I decided I would make one final yolo and be done with it. Bought on the dip a bunch of slightly OTM AMD calls expiring tomorrow, and some $1 otm SPY calls expiring next week. \n\n\nStuck to the playbook by staring at charts for 20 minutes, started losing money fast. Was down $300. Doubled down on AMD after freeing up some cash selling a few stocks. Everything came back up a little bit but then started going down again. \"Oh well, if this doesn't pan out I will just stop playing options\" I thought to myself. \n\nI then closed robinhood and went out to do some maintenance on my truck and totally forget about the whole thing. \n\nIn typical fashion, all of the sudden I think \"Oh shit! The calls!\" and open robinhood. Only to find myself up 95% on my AMD calls and 30%+ on my spy calls. \n\nThese gains have made up for the last 3 months of my shitty options trading. I know this is going to go to my head and lead to more bad trading. Even though I am self aware enough to acknowledge this I know it's not going to make a difference. \n\nTldr; I am back on my yolo shit boys. \n\n\nYa'll got any of them poorly written DD posts?",

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/labor-day-weekend-and-more-bullish)\n\n**TLDR:** stock market news sentiment remains significantly bullish for yet another week in a row, driven by optimistic monthly reports released for the month of August and continued upward trends from the SP500 and global cryptocurrency market.\n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nAs we commence our first week of Autumn 2021, stock market news remains just as bullish as it was to end the summer. News coverage this week was relatively unchanged in terms of sentiment compared to last week. Overall, the average finance article written this week scored a 0.35 in terms of sentiment (meaning that just over 1-in-3 sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically) and a 0.63 in terms of time-sense expressed (meaning that almost 2-in-3 sentences published this week were written in future tense). Here\u2019s a look at the major news events driving the continued all-time high bullish sentiment this past week:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Stocks: The major U.S. stock indexes traded in a narrow range all week, but the S&amp;P 500 managed to post a modest gain for the second week in a row.1 The NASDAQ outperformed its peers for the second consecutive week while the Dow fell slightly. Despite sustaining a mid-month decline, the S&amp;P 500 recovered to record its seventh positive month in a row, posting a return of about 3% in August. The index reached 12 record closing highs in the month versus 7 in July.\n\n\u20bf Cryptos: Much of this week\u2019s news optimism can be attributed to the continued meteoric rise in cryptocurrency prices. Global cryptocurrency market capitalization grew 11.5% this week to $2.4T dollars to cap off the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume. The majority of crypto-related headlines this week came on the back of Ethereum ($ETH) which rose more than 20% to $3,935.17 per coin this week at the time of this writing; other big crypto movers this week include Solana ($SOL) and Bitcoin ($BTC) as it eyes its first \u201cgolden cross\u201d since May 2020.\n\n\ud83e\udd85 Economy: While news optimism remains relatively high overall, time-sense fell slightly this week as a slew of monthly economic reports were released for the month of August. A private report showed that the U.S. economy recorded its 15th consecutive monthly gain in manufacturing activity in August. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index rose 0.4% to 59.9. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing activity. We also saw August\u2019s monthly job report this week. The economy generated 235,000 new jobs last month, far short of economists\u2019 expectations and trailing gains of nearly 1.1 million in July and 962,000 in June. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% in July.\n\n# 2. Most Mentioned Tickers \ud83d\udcca\n\nEach week we analyze the number of headlines written about each stock and cryptocurrency. The most mentioned tickers in this week\u2019s news and the tickers with the biggest volume increase compared to last week are shown here: [most mentioned tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d976bee-76fb-40f8-b7b7-1a97515e6ff3_1230x753.png)\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Apple ($AAPL): For the second consecutive week, $AAPL was mentioned more in news coverage than any other ticker in finance articles scraped this week. A mainstay of our weekly most-mentioned list, Apple Inc. churns news headlines, whether or not there\u2019s actually significant news to report about the company or its stock. Following the 10-year anniversary of Tim Cook\u2019s tenure as Apple CEO last week \u2014 as part of which he received $750M in $AAPL share value under the terms of his contract \u2014 headlines this week centered around an open letter written to Cook by Apple employees presenting a litany of grievances including concerns about privacy and diversity within the company. Apple also saw headlines from outside the workplace this week, as regulators from around the world mount pressure on the company\u2019s current App Store policy, accusing Apple of exerting too much control (ex. a 30% commission on in-app purchases) on developers who use it to sell products.\n\n\u201cWhat is Apple Thinking?\u201d | The New York Times\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 Automatic Data Processing Inc. ($ADP): The ticker with the biggest increase in news headlines this week compared to last week was $ADP. The stock fell a slight -0.86% last week and has now dropped nearly 3% over the past month to $207.38 per share as the company plans to go ex-dividend on September 9th. This means investors who purchase and settle shares of $ADP before this upcoming Thursday will be eligible to receive the company\u2019s $0.93 dividend payment per share, which will be paid out on October 1st. Automatic Data Processing\u2019s previous dividend payment consumed approximately 61% of the company\u2019s free cash flow last year, and while this is in the normal range for most dividend-paying organizations, analysts seem to agree that the decision bodes well for the company\u2019s long-term strategy by freeing up some space on their margins during a relatively lean period in its history as a business. Overall news sentiment for $ADP scored a +41.05% on a scale from -100% to +100%, signaling relatively bullish sentiment to boot over the past week.\n\n\u201cAutomatic Data Processing, Inc.

Sentiment Winners and Losers \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e\n\nEach week we summarize the most extreme sentiment scores in the news for each ticker to help you decide where to focus your attention. Here\u2019s a look at which tickers scored the highest (and lowest) in terms of optimism, pessimism, speculation, and reaction expressed in this past week\u2019s news: [most optimistic and pessimistic tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ce2ff0-9cf0-4d9e-b630-893857f80eee_2181x1305.png)\n\n# Sentiment: Most Optimistic\ud83d\ude00 and Pessimistic\ud83d\ude12 Tickers\n\n\ud83d\udcf6 Motorola Solutions Inc. ($MSI): This week\u2019s most optimistic stock in news coverage was Motorola Solutions Inc. (optimism score: 58.9%). $MSI stock rose a mere 0.76% on the week to build on 46.7% growth so far in 2021. Motorola Solutions \u2014 which succeeded Motorola, Inc., following the spinoff of the mobile phone division into Motorola Mobility in 2011 \u2014 has been spoken of with relatively good cheer compared to industry competitors like Qualcomm ($QCOM) and Verizon ($VZ). Much of the optimism has come as a revelation following the company\u2019s Q2 earnings released nearly a month ago on August 5th, in which the company revealed stratospheric annual earnings per share growth of 41% compound. While some may call it an old-fashioned investment in today\u2019s age of \u201ctech-stock blue sky investing\u201d, it\u2019s hard to argue with bonafide profitability like this if you\u2019re investing for the long-term. This week\u2019s most optimistic $MSI article:\n\n\u201cHere's Why I Think Motorola Solutions Is An Interesting Stock\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n\ud83d\udc15 Shiba Inu Coin ($SHIB): This week\u2019s most pessimistic (and reactive) ticker in news coverage was Shiba Inu Coin (pessimism score: 29.3%). Even though we saw relatively low amounts of pessimism in this week\u2019s news coverage across the board, $SHIB saw more pessimism expressed in articles this week than any other ticker, as the fringe cryptocurrency reached its lowest price of the past month on Tuesday (a whopping $0.000006735 per coin \u2014 yes, that\u2019s five zeroes after the decimal) as its developers announced that they\u2019d be removing a portion of the existing $SHIB supply from circulation. Though $SHIB price rose considerably heading into the weekend and continues to trend upwards at the time of this writing, it\u2019s still down 11% in value over the past month. Keep in mind that the coin \u2014 which was created in April as a blatant meme and borderline Ponzi scheme in response to the meteoric rise in the price of Dogecoin early this year \u2014 has grown 45x in value since its inception four months ago. In other words: a $1,000 investment in Shiba Inu Coin back in April is now worth somewhere around $42,000. This week\u2019s most pessimistic $SHIB article:\n\n\u201cHow the Shiba Inu Coin Burn is Attempting to Rekindle a Meme\u2019s Magic\u201d | Fast Company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Time-Sense: Most Speculative\ud83e\udd14\u23e9 and Reactive\ud83d\ude2e\u23ee\ufe0f Tickers: \n\nimage: [most speculative and reactive tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9219e3f-a6d0-4987-8b31-8e3d32fc3bfd_2203x1315.png)\n\n\ud83d\udd0b FirstEnergy Corp. ($FE): The stock with the most speculative (ie. future-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was FirstEnergy (speculation score: 95.4%). $FE stock 2.86% this week to $39.59 to cap a 34.16% run in share price year-to-date as the energy utility company has benefited from improving electricity demand in recent months. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. retail electricity sales are likely to inch up 2.7% in 2021 after sliding 3.9% in 2020. Given the growth in demand, coupled with FirstEnergy\u2019s 96.5% earnings growth this year and given that its stock is still trading 52.8% below its estimated fair value (according to Simply Wall St.), analysts speculate that its stock is set to remain a handsome mid- to long-term investment. Analysts also cite $FE\u2019s 14% return on equity (ROE) as a reassuring sign that the company is growing in value and effectively managing investors\u2019 money. This week\u2019s most speculative $FE article:\n\n\u201cShould You Be Excited About FirstEnergy Corp.'s 14% Return On Equity?\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udc5c PVH Corp. ($PVH): The stock with the most reactive (ie. past-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was PVH Corp. (reaction score: 53.6%). $PVH stock price stair-stepped up 5.12% to $118.84 per share on Wednesday following the release of its Q2 earnings report, which beat consensus analyst earnings and laid out an upbeat outlook for the remainder of the year. The company (formerly known as Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation) is one of the world\u2019s largest clothing conglomerates and owner/licenser of brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole New York, and Michael Kors. PVH Corp announced quarterly earnings per share of $2.72 \u2014 crushing analyst estimates $1.52 \u2014 and posted revenue growth of 46% YoY to $2.31 billion as consumers begin to return to their pre-pandemic apparel shopping habits. Following the beat-and-raise report, analysts at JPMorgan and Credit Suisse both announced increased price targets for $PVH. The most reactive $PVH article this week:\n\n\u201cPVH, IBD Stock Of Day, Breaks Out As Calvin Klein Owner's Earnings Beat\u201d | Investor\u2019s Business Daily\n\n# Biggest Mood Swings and Changes \ud83c\udfad\ud83d\udd00\n\nEach week we compare the sentiment of each ticker to its sentiment from the previous week. Presented below are the tickers that saw the biggest change in each of our four sentiment metrics this week compared to last: [image](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ffb0c2-1e95-4b38-b913-cf5a9e81061e_2038x769.png)\n\n\ud83d\udcbd Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week after $AMD stock broke resistance above $109 per share early in the week; analysts at Benzinga say the stock has now settled into its second bullish pattern of the past month. On Wednesday, it was reported the U.S. Department of Energy was nearing a deal worth $500 million to purchase a supercomputer made with AMD and NVIDIA Corp.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Coinbase Inc. ($COIN) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week despite the stock rallying 8.62% to $278.44 per share. This increase in pessimism can be widely attributed to a handful of contrarian, negative articles published by the likes of the Motley Fool and SeekingAlpha arguing that the underlying volatility of digital assets makes Coinbase an inherently risky stock to invest in.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Hewlett Packard Enterprises Co. ($HPE) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last as the stock remained relatively flat over the trading period, rising just 0.06% to $15.67 per share. Much of the speculation surrounding the company\u2019s lackluster earnings report released early in the week, in which the company\u2019s continued supply chain issues showed through. Analysts wonder if HP\u2019s component supply concerns will continue.\n\n\ud83d\udc89 Moderna Inc. ($MRNA) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed after increasing in stock price by more than 13% to $416.70 per share on strong trading volume and new research released this week suggesting that the company\u2019s COVID-19 shot may offer longer-lasting protection that Pfizer\u2019s amid growing conversation about the importance (or lack thereof) of booster shots.\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis past week brought a close to the month of August and commenced the unofficial start of Fall 2021. In terms of market action, August was the 7th consecutive month of stock market growth, and the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trade volume. This past week was no exception to the tremendous momentum in both realms, and news sentiment reflected this: stock market news articles published this week saw more optimism expressed on average than any other week this year except for one (the first week of August, the height of Q2 earnings).\n\nLooking ahead into September and October, the extreme optimism is showing no signs of slowing down as Wall Street expectations for the next stock market earnings season continue to rise. Over July and August, forecasts for third-quarter earnings of companies in the S&amp;P 500 rose 3.8%, according to FactSet. That\u2019s the fourth-largest such increase during the first two months of a quarter since 2009.\n\nWhile market bulls are currently reveling in the continued outperforms of stocks, market bears may be quick to point out that we are growing more and more due for some sort of correction. The S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t suffered a 5% pullback since October 2020. The last time the index experienced such a long period without a big drop was from June 2016 to early February 2018. With that in mind, we will continue to watch the progression of international economic factors like the COVID-19 Delta variant and the transition to Taliban rule in Afghanistan for any inkling of adverse impact on the U.S. stock market. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s report; good luck this week everyone, and thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude4f",

I cant focus on anything else, iam struggling to breath. \n\nWhat should i do? Iam suspecting that it will go up today slightly and then maybe sell.

        "selftext": "**CHIIIIIPPPPPPSSSSS - NOM NOM**\n\nGood morning ladies and gents.  Lets talk about chips - semiconductors to be exact.  If you have tried to purchase a car or refrigerator in the past few months you've noticed that either the price has increased or they are on backorder.  \n\nUnfortunately, everything from your car's dashboard to your dragon shaped dildo now requires a computer chip.  Because of this all this, the semiconductor/chip stocks have been shooting straight up (**AMD, TSM, NVDA**).  Their valuations are high, but this is rightfully so since the semiconductor shortage is theoretically going to last until 2023 according to analysts (1).  This is where **HIMX** enters the building.\n\n**HIMX** is a fabless semiconductor provider.  They create a multitude of design solutions for visual displays (TV's, Laptops, mobile phones, car navigation, VR devices) as well as a whole host of additional products such as silicon IP's and LCOS micro displays for automotive HUD.   The company is based in Taiwan, and has been chugging along during the pandemic, increasing their quarterly revenue growth by an impressive 95.5% yoy.  It's quarterly earnings have beaten expectations during the last two quarters, but due to the China FUD and being located in Taiwan it's become risky for investors.  \n\n**BEARISH POINTS**\n\nSo let me lay out the bear case before I start pumping the bull argument.  There is a legitimate fear that China will eventually completely control Taiwan and impose the same tariffs that already exist for mainland China.  This would drastically hurt business with the West, from which HIMX draws a large portion of it's customer base.   Taiwan's position is that as long as they keep making semiconductors, they are important to the West, and we will protect them.  At the moment, that's still the case, and looks like that will continue to be the case for the next few years.\n\nFrom a technical aspect this company is being shorted heavily.  The put/call ratio is 1.34, the short interest on Aug 13th was 10.35%, and the short ratio everyday since Aug 13th has increased dramatically. \n\nSo if you think China doesn't plan to start WWIII, please keep reading.  \n\n**BULLISH POINTS**\n\nThe bullish argument is that you have a company creating a product that is in high demand, and will continue to be in high demand in the near future.  **TSM** has raised the prices of their semiconductors by 10% within the past month, it's likely that **HIMX** will follow suit.  There are two opportunities for them to make this announcement within this week: Sept 6-7th dbAccess IAA Cars Virtual Conference 2021 and Sept 6-10th 22nd Credit Suisse Asian Technology Conference (2).  \n\nWhen **HIMX** P/E is compared to other semiconductor stocks, it's much lower (Trailing P/E 9.94 vs. 32.55 for **TSM**).  Within the past month the price action has pushed **HIMX** back down to the 200SMA, which it has been grinding along for the past week.  The price action appears to be consolidating against the 200SMA which suggests a big move in either direction.  According to FinTel the short borrow fee rate jumped from 0.7% to 1.86% on Sep 3rd.  The number of shares available to borrow has been steadily decreasing within the past two weeks while the price has begun to stagnate.  It appears HIMX is going to make a decent sized move soon, and with analysts suggesting a low PT of 19 and high 23.50, it's only a matter of time until this puppy pops (3).  \n\nPositions:\n\n[40x $13 10/15 calls](https://imgur.com/a/Nc296SF)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) [Chip shortage could last into 2023, says car boss (BBC)](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58465954) \n\n2) [HIMX Event Calendar](https://www.himax.com.tw/investors/event-calendar/)\n\n3) [HIMX - CNN Forecast](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=HIMX)",

        "selftext": "This is in no way financial advice. I'm merely informing any potential readers about some of the less obvious things I've learned that turned out to be \"profitable knowledge.\" \n\nHowever, being as I'm a small sample-size, it's impossible to determine whether or not this knowledge is actually inherently sound/true, or is it just luck / happenstance? Consequently, this cannot be considered factual. \n\n1.) Trade what you, as a consumer, find value in. Every American Adult is an expert consumer, to varying degrees. It comes with the territory. If you find a (preferably new) product or service that is clearly doing something superior in comparison to it's competitors, chances are, others will notice this too. Eventually, this should reflect in the stock price. \n\n2.) Create a watch-list. These should be companies you are VERY familiar with. What do they provide to their consumers? Who is their CEO? How many employees do they have? Have you looked at their income statements? Can you find trends in their share price? \n\n2.5.) Keep adding companies to your watch-list. \n\n3.) Knowledge that doesn't DIRECTLY PERTAIN to the stock-market is often the most valuable knowledge. For example, 3-4 years ago, any person who understands basic computer jargon (CPU, GPU, Benchmarks, etc) could tell you that AMD was TOTALLY changing the paradigm in CPU development for PC's. \nLast year, any person who pays for gyms &amp; tanning salons could recognize that Planet Fitness memberships are incredibly value-centric. \nMy point is this: reading the Wall Street Journal, or watching traders on Youtube, this is fine &amp; dandy, but, often to truly understand a market, you need to have a VERY GOOD understanding of the service or product they provide. \nLet's say you're contemplating investing in a Shipping Company who specializes in Over-Seas &amp; Heavy-Load hauling. \nDon't ask some trader or broker if it's a good investment. \nFind a commercial Boat Captain. \n\n4.) (This one I hate) When I first contemplated trading, I assumed that the catalyst for most share price moves were recently acquired revenue streams, new services &amp; products, etc.   \nHowever, as I've come to realize, The Market is more akin to a sewing circle than an actual reflection of the companies it is comprised of. Specifically speaking: The perception of potential is, somehow, far more appealing to most investors than the revenue of today.  \n\nIf anyone is seriously interested in more of the things I've learned, let me know, I just don't want to keep writing if nobody cares. \nI enjoy helping people. Gives me that white magic. \n:P",

The CRM stock was from the result of Slack acquisition. \n\nFor Intel, I'm waiting to see how their big.Little CPUs and ARC GPUs will perform in reviews. If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.\n\nFor Qualcomm, I'm betting that their Nuvia acquisition will allow them to move into the laptop/desktop market but it's a small bet right now. Again, I will wait for reviews of their first Nuvia product before deciding if I want to buy more because of the lag between reviews and Wallstreet reacting.\n\nSo far, I've beaten S&amp;P500 last year and this year so far.",

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/772aqq7nwno71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7319d506eb7da567c5ab1a86d4e4f1d08dc06e29\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.
