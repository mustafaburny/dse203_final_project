I subscribed for $99/year and booted the Windows virtual machine onto my computer. I proceeded to install Google Chrome, login to Schwab and downloaded and installed StreetSmart Edge.\n\nAt no point has it yet asked me to PURCHASE a Windows 10 license. It did prompt me when I opened the Windows settings to see if I\u2019m all good.\n\nOnly a handful of reputable brokerages have a native Mac installable platform. With this option, I saved myself so much hassle, kept my positions fungible and saved $XXXX on the theoretical purchase of a new computer. This is such a game changer for me, and I hope I help someone today with this information.",

        "selftext": "ZIXI is a rocket and blast off is next week when they report earnings. For the uninformed, Zix Corporation provides  a whole suite of Cyber security shits and data management; email encryption, data loss prevention (DLP), threat protection, archiving for the secure exchange of email, etc. So if youre a boomer and need to put labels on things, theyre an Integrated Email Security Solutions company. But they're making a strongly push into cloud adoption by increasing coverage of SaaS apps on cloud platforms. They acquired CloudAlly(channel focused cloud computing) which will add to Zix's capabilities in cloud-based data backup and recovery for appliance purposes.\n\nNow enough of the into. Here's the long dick of reasons it's Undervalued now, and will be even more undervalued after earnings which is going to be the catalyst for the price to catch up to financials/growth: \nThey grew their ARR by 11% in Q3'20... That's annual recurring revenue, meaning as it grows it's compounding unlike a typical revenue growth which could be fluke or one time spike. More specifically, cloud-based ARR was 19%, which is the area to be most excited about and the area they're expanding through acquisitions and strategic partnerships/marketing.\n\n Their market cap is only $540.7m, with LTM revenue of $211m. So trading at only about 2.5x. Additionally,  FY20 revenue is expected to come in at $217.5m, which would be 25.4% YoY growth from it's FY19 revenue of $173m. That's huge growth and it is not priced in. That growth expectation is also probably way too conservative from the analysts because last earnings they beat EPS estimates by over 13% and the CloudAlly numbers/synergies aren't factored in at all because the estimates for this quarter are still the same as they were a year ago and haven't been revised despite the acquisition in November. Clown shit\nLTM EBITDA is $43.6m, a whole ass 65.8% jump from FY19 EBITDA which was $26.3m.\u00a0\n\nNow for the cherry on tits::::\nFair Value Estimates\n\nZIXI is currently trading at\u00a0$10.02.\u00a0There are 3 fair value models that compare ZIXIs financials, price, growth, and other historical data then compares it to ZIXI growth and price action and also compares the same data of competitors and peers. The 3 models are listed below and come in with an average target price of\u00a0$14.67\u00a0and represents\u00a046.4% upside.

        "selftext": "ZIXI is a rocket and blast off is next week when they report earnings. For the uninformed, Zix Corporation provides  a whole suite of Cyber security shits and data management; email encryption, data loss prevention (DLP), threat protection, archiving for the secure exchange of email, etc. So if youre a boomer and need to put labels on things, theyre an Integrated Email Security Solutions company. But they're making a strongly push into cloud adoption by increasing coverage of SaaS apps on cloud platforms. They acquired CloudAlly(channel focused cloud computing) which will add to Zix's capabilities in cloud-based data backup and recovery for appliance purposes.\n\nNow enough of the into. Here's the long dick of reasons it's Undervalued now, and will be even more undervalued after earnings which is going to be the catalyst for the price to catch up to financials/growth: \nThey grew their ARR by 11% in Q3'20... That's annual recurring revenue, meaning as it grows it's compounding unlike a typical revenue growth which could be fluke or one time spike. More specifically, cloud-based ARR was 19%, which is the area to be most excited about and the area they're expanding through acquisitions and strategic partnerships/marketing.\n\n Their market cap is only $540.7m, with LTM revenue of $211m. So trading at only about 2.5x. Additionally,  FY20 revenue is expected to come in at $217.5m, which would be 25.4% YoY growth from it's FY19 revenue of $173m. That's huge growth and it is not priced in. That growth expectation is also probably way too conservative from the analysts because last earnings they beat EPS estimates by over 13% and the CloudAlly numbers/synergies aren't factored in at all because the estimates for this quarter are still the same as they were a year ago and haven't been revised despite the acquisition in November.
