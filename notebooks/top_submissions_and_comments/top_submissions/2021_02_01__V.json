        "selftext": "KEY POINTS: (Please read) thank you\n\n1. Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the \"cause\" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers.\n2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying \"lets get this to $30\" or \"let get this to 100\". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.\n3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video &gt;&gt;&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)\n4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)\n\nFamiliarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.\n\n\\- They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.\n\n5. Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.\n\n6. Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.\n\n7. Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.\n\n8. What is short selling: &gt;&gt; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)\n\n9. Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)\n\n10. Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.\n\n11. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.\n\n12. Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.\n\nI hope this helps many.",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, I been looking for a good stock under the radar and managed to find one finally\n\nI will be talking about $INKW (Greene Concepts)\n\nThe company came back to life because of their new product BeWater and they are looking really good and have a strong future ahead.\n\nLet's get straight to the facts.\n\n\\- CEO is talking about listing in the NASDAQ and has a future in being in the NASDAQ. They have already 4m in assets which is a requirement for the NASDAQ. I don't think I have seen any CEO's of any penny stock companies talking about listing in NASDAQ this early so this is a good sign to me.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-prepared-rise-steadily-152500531.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-prepared-rise-steadily-152500531.html)\n\n\\-2 months ago they restructured their share structure. They retired 285 million shares from their OS. Now why would a company that is just getting started do that? Think guys.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-announces-284-million-150100223.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-announces-284-million-150100223.html)\n\n\\- They got into amazon and sold out in less than a hour. They are also looking to expand into Walmart and global markets which is a very very strong sign imo.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-water-product-online-145400843.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-water-product-online-145400843.html)\n\namazon listing - [https://www.amazon.com/Artesian-Natural-Alkaline-Artisanal-Springs/dp/B08QF9CB9L/ref=sr\\_1\\_6?dchild=1&amp;keywords=be+water+artesian&amp;qid=1611925054&amp;sr=8-6](https://www.amazon.com/Artesian-Natural-Alkaline-Artisanal-Springs/dp/B08QF9CB9L/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&amp;keywords=be+water+artesian&amp;qid=1611925054&amp;sr=8-6)\n\nrestocking amazon inventory - [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-demand-high-greene-concepts-145400877.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-demand-high-greene-concepts-145400877.html)\n\nThere is also very strong buys indicator from different analysts from what I can find online.\n\n[https://otcbb.swingtradebot.com/equities/INKW:OTC](https://otcbb.swingtradebot.com/equities/INKW:OTC)\n\n\\- this is a example, don't want to link every site\n\nAlso in between the lines of one of the news article the CEO states \"  This is just the beginning of many wonderful things to come and I would like to thank Amazon for helping us get this wonderful product to the masses. This is an immensely powerful step in our quest to reach NASDAQ and continual incremental growth as a company\". So my question is not only are they releasing water will they be coming out with new products? And after the performance of the opening day of BeWater, I wonder how strong the new products will be.\n\nI think this stock will get the attention it deserves when earnings report is out because a stock evaluated at 0.015 right now with this strong of a profile is really rare.\n\nMy opinion on the CEO - I also strongly believe in this company because of the CEO. I like how he talks about his vision and his plans months before he does it. He claimed to moving into amazon 3 months ago and as soon as he puts his product on amazon, it sells out in less than a hour. Keep in mind this was the #1 new best seller in mineral water when it came out.\n\nVideo on why you should hold the stock- \n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=ByDuChGGIzM&amp;feature=share",

JUST TELL ME WHAT THE ANALYSTS ARE SAYING.**\n\n&gt; The major analyst firms that are currently providing coverage include [Cantor Fitzgerald](https://www.cantor.com/), \n[H.C. Wainwright](https://hcwco.com/),\n[Stifel Nicolaus](https://www.stifel.com/), [William Blair](https://www.williamblair.com/), [Mizuho](https://www.mizuhogroup.com), and\n[Canaccord Genuity](https://www.canaccordgenuity.com/). \n\n&gt; All analysts have initiated a [consensus overweight rating](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SELB/research-ratings), \nwith an average price target of $7.08, and an upper estimate of $13. Respectively, that\u2019s a share\nprice increase of 77% and 225%. A critical note is that these ratings are quite recent, not historic. For example, Mizuho upgraded Selecta Biosciences as recently as [last week](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-selb-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-01/), while HC Wainwright issued a buy rating on January 7th, and Canaccord Genuity set a $13.00 [price target](https://www.analystratings.com/articles/canaccord-genuity-sticks-to-its-buy-rating-for-selecta-biosciences-selb/) also on January 7th. \n\n &gt; The stock currently trades at a 21% discount from its 52 week high of $4.83.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**COMPANY OVERVIEW**\n\nSelecta Biosciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company, headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts, and led by President and CEO, Dr. Carsten Brunn, who previously served as the President of Pharmaceuticals at Bayer (American Region). Selecta Biosciences was founded in 2008, and initiated their public offering on June 22nd, 2016. Their flagship product is the clinically-validated ImmTOR platform, a system for developing antigen-specific tolerogenic therapies. They have acquireed partnerships with multiple major pharmaceutical\ncompanies, including [Sobi](https://www.sobi.com/), [Serepta Therapeutics](https://www.sarepta.com/), and [AskBio](https://www.askbio.com/), and they have recently received a consensus analyst buy rating, with an upper end price target of $13, representing a 225% increase from the current share price. The science behind Selecta, and their ImmTOR technology, is largely based on a 1994 [research paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8128245/) published in the journal *Science*. In 2006, [Dr. Omid Farokhzad](https://farokhzad.bwh.harvard.edu/wp/members/principal-investigator/), a professor at Harvard Medical school and the director of [The Center for Nanomedicine at BWH](https://nanomedicine.bwh.harvard.edu/), along with prolific MIT inventor, [Dr. Robert Langer](https://www.statnews.com/2016/05/31/robert-langer-biotech-new-york-city/), published a [highly cited paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17070960/) showing how to use synthesized nanoparticles to deliver drugs to cancer cells. In 2008, they founded Selecta Biosciences with Harvard immunologist Ulrich von Andrian.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE COMPANY MANAGEMENT LOOK LIKE?**\n\nIf you have followed some of my previous posts and comments, you will know that I consider management to be the most important factor. Regardless of the product, industry, or finances, it is the people running the company that will determine its success. In my opinion, among every biotechnology company that I have evaluated, Selecta Biosciences has the strongest management team.\n\nSelecta Biosciences is led by President and CEO, Dr. Carsten Brunn, who holds a Ph.D\nin chemistry, from the University of Hamburg. Prior to his work at Selecta, Dr. Brunn was\nthe president of Pharmaceuticals for the Americas Region at Bayer. He served as chairman\nof the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations Japan, and he held senior leadership positions at Eli Lilly, Novartis, Basilea, and Bausch &amp; Lomb.\n\nSelecta\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer is Dr. Takashi Keisters Kishimoto, who holds a Ph.D in immunology\nfrom Harvard University. Dr. Kishimoto was previously the Vice President of Discovery\nResearch at Momenta Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company that was purchased\nBy Johnson &amp; Johnson in October of 2020, for $6.5 billion. Over the course of his career, \nDr. Kishimoto has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles in major scientific journals, \nIncluding Nature, Science, and The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAmong their all-star Board of Directors is [Dr. Goran A. Ando](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gran-ando), a 37 year veteran in the\npharmaceutical industry. Dr. Ando is the former Chairman of the Board of Novo Nordisk, one \nof the world\u2019s leading pharmaceutical companies. Prior to that, Dr. Ando held executive\npositions at Pfizer and Bristol-Myers. \n\nFor a full list of leadership, please use [this link](https://selectabio.com/about-us/).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS THE ImmTOR PLATFORM?**\n\nLet\u2019s start with an introduction to the problem. Immunogenicity is the ability of a substance to stimulate an antigen-specific immune response. Antigens include a wide array of substances produced by cells,\nbacteria, fungi, or other organisms, but they are typically proteins. Unfortunately, immunogenicity can cause unwanted immune responses, such as the formation\nof anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), which can alter the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of different drugs, or the induction of hypersensitivity reactions, which have life-threatening\nconsequences. ImmTOR is coadministered with biologic therapies, and it is shown to restore natural tolerance and enable patients to remain on therapies longer.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**HOW DOES THE ImmTOR PLATFORM WORK?**\n\nFrom Selecta Biosciences,\n\n&gt; ImmTOR is designed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance by targeting rapamycin to immune cells using nanoparticle technology, which has been clinically proven as an effective delivery system. When administered to a patient, ImmTOR nanoparticles are filtered out by lymph nodes, spleen and liver, where they are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), a type of APC which can trigger immunogenic as well as tolerogenic responses from T cells. ImmTOR promotes the induction of tolerogenic DC which go on to activate antigen-specific regulatory T cells to suppress the immune response to the antigen.\n\nFor a more in-depth look at ImmTOR, please refer to [this article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00969/full#:~:text=general%20immune%20suppression%20is%20supported,to%20subsequent%20challenge%20with%20antigen), which discusses\nThe development of ImmTOR Tolerogenic Nanoparticles.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THEIR PIPELINE LOOK LIKE?**\n\nFor a portfolio overview, please use [this link](https://selectabio.com/portfolio/)\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHERE CAN I FIND PEER-REVIEWED RESEARCH?**\n\nYou can find a selection of peer-reviewed research [here](https://selectabio.com/resources/).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT PARTNERSHIPS HAS SELECTA SECURED?**\n\nSelecta has several research and commercial rights partnerships with global pharmaceutical companies. These \ninclude [Sobi](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/11/2047185/0/en/Sobi-and-Selecta-announce-strategic-licensing-agreement-for-SEL-212-a-phase-3-ready-novel-treatment-for-Chronic-Refractory-Gout.html), for strategic licensing of SEL-212, [AskBio](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/12/19/1962801/0/en/AskBio-Licenses-Rights-to-Selecta-Biosciences-ImmTOR-Immune-Tolerance-Platform-for-the-Treatment-of-Pompe-Disease.html) for the use of ImmTOR in the treatment\nof Pompe Disease, and [Serepta Therapeutics](https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-and-selecta-biosciences-enter-research)\nfor the use of ImmTOR for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS THE VALUE PROPOSITION?**\n\nThis is likely one of the easiest questions to answer. A large amount of drugs provoke unwanted immune responses, which reduce a drug\u2019s efficacy\nand exacerbate adverse effects. The ImmTOR platform creates drug-specific immune tolerance, enhancing the effectiveness of drugs, as well\nas its safety profile. This means the ImmTOR platform can be used in cooperation with a substantial amount of other drugs. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS SELECTA BIOSCIENCES FINANCIAL SITUATION?**\n\n\n*Recent Financing:* \n\nOn June 11th of 2020, Selecta entered into a [strategic licensing agreement](https://www.sobi.com/en/press-releases/sobi-and-selecta-announce-strategic-licensing-agreement-sel-212-phase-3-ready-novel)\nwith [Sobi](https://www.sobi.com/en/about), and international biopharmaceutical company worth $48 billion. \nThe agreement is for SEL-212, Selecta\u2019s phase-3-ready therapy powered\nby ImmTOR, their immune tolerance platform. Included in the deal is an initial\npayment of $100 million, commercial and milestone payments of up to\n$630 million, tiered double-digit royalties on net sales, and equity purchases at $4.62/share.\nThis means you can currently purchase shares at a discount to what Sobi paid. \n\n\nOn September 1st of 2020, Selecta Biosciences secured up to [$35 million in debt financing](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/01/2086854/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-Secures-Up-To-35-Million-Debt-Financing-with-Oxford-Finance-LLC-and-Silicon-Valley-Bank.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20terms%20of%20the,achievement%20of%20two%20development%20milestones%3A), available in two tranches, \nwith $25 million issued at closing, and an additional $10 million available through September 30th of 2021. Part of these proceeds will be used to retire $12.6 million\nin existing debt.\n\n*Cash Position:* \n\nSelecta had $147.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2020, which compares to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $91.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Selecta believes its available cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2020 will enable Selecta to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2023.\n\n*Revenue:* \n\nRevenue recognition for the third quarter 2020 was $4.6 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized $4.3 million under the license agreement with Sobi resulting from the shipment of clinical supply and the reimbursement of costs incurred for the Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program and $0.3 million for shipments under the collaboration agreement with Sarepta. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, Selecta did not recognize revenue.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT KEY MILESTONES HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ACHIEVED?**\n\n* **1.** In September, Selecta commenced the Phase 3 clinical program, known as [DISSOLVE](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/23/2097859/0/en/First-Patient-Randomized-in-the-Phase-3-DISSOLVE-Clinical-Program-of-SEL-212-for-Chronic-Refractory-Gout.html) for the clinical evaluation of SEL-212, which is the foundation\nfor Selecta\u2019s pipeline of tolerogenic therapies. \n\n* **2.** In October, the FDA granted Selecta the [Rare Pediatric Disease Designation](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/20/2111023/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-and-AskBio-Receive-FDA-Rare-Pediatric-Disease-Designation-for-their-Gene-Therapy-for-Methylmalonic-Acidemia.html) for MMA-101, used in the treatment of\nIsolated methylmalonic academia. This designation highlights the significant unmet medial need that Selecta is seeking to address. Phase 1 clinical trials\nare expected to begin in the first half of 2021, with data expected before the end of the year. \n\n* **3.** Also in October, Selecta and IGAN Biosciences entered into a [research license and option agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/08/2105919/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-and-IGAN-Biosciences-Enter-into-Research-License-and-Option-Agreement-to-Study-Selecta-s-ImmTOR-Immune-Tolerance-Platform-in-Combination-with-IGAN-s-IgA-Proteas.html)\nwhich provides Selecta with the option to exclusive licensure for the rights to develop and commercialize the ImmTOR platform in\ncombination with IGAN\u2019s [IgA protease](https://www.iganbio.com/iga-protease-for-igan/), which is used to treat [IgA Nephropathy](https://igan.org/)\n\n* **4.** On January 6th, Selecta announced pre-clinical data in non-human primates\nthat validated the ImmTOR platform\u2019s ability to enhance the efficacy, safety and durability of \nadeno-associated viral vector gene therapies. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE INSIDER ACTIVITY LOOK LIKE**\n\nInsider activity is an excellent way to assess the confidence of the company executives. I\u2019m sure most of you are familiar with the phrase, \u201cput your money\nwhere your mouth is\u201d. I prefer to speculate on companies where the executives have a large incentive for success.\n\nOver the last twelve months, we\u2019ve seen a staggering 9,351,485 [shares purchased by insiders](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/selb/insider-activity), compared against 13,314 that were sold.\nOn January 4th of 2021, we saw 262,000 non-open market shares acquired by company officers, and in October, Timothy Springer [purchased a whopping](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/timothy-springer-just-bought-25-142015780.html)\n$5.4 million worth of stock.\n\nIn addition to this, Selecta has an astounding institutional ownership of 64.41%, compiled from 98 different institutional holders.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE OPTION CHAIN LOOK LIKE?**\n\nSelecta has options available with three strike prices and expirations on March 19th, June 18th, and September 17th. The March 19th $5 call options have recently seen a volume spike, and had\nan open interest of 2564 as of Friday, January 29th. These are the highest volume of all available options. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHY AM I PURCHASING THE STOCK NOW?**\n\nIn my opinion, all clinical-stage biotechnology companies present three obvious challenges. Will their product work, do they have enough capital to reach commercialization, and have they partnered with any major company that can accelerate their product or service? Prior to discovering these answers, biotechs are highly speculative. After years of development, I believe that Selecta has reached all three milestones. In light of these milestones, as well as analyst endorsements, FDA approvals, institutional and insider purchasing, option volume and volatility, and growing sentiment, I think Selecta is poised for significant growth. Beyond this, I find tremendous value in a company that has licensing deals worth more than the companies entire market capitilization. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**TL:DR;**\n\nSelecta Biosciences is a Watertown, Massachusetts based biotechnology company. They are engaged in the \nresearch and development of nanoparticle immunomodulatory drugs that work in conjunction with existing\nbiologics, for the treatment and prevention of numerous human diseases. Their flagship product\nis the ImmTOR Tolerogenic Nanoparticle Platform, a technology used to mitigate anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)\nin response to life-sustaining drugs. Their lead pharmaceutical candidate is SEL-212, a Phase 3 enzymatic \ntherapy for the treatment of gout, one of the most common forms of arthritis. The company is managed by\na cast of successful executives, many of whom previously held leadership roles at Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, Bayer,\nand other global pharmaceutical companies. They are financed through 2023, and have recently received\na consensus buy rating from major analysts, with a price target range of $7-$13. The stock is majority held by \ninstitutional investors, and insiders have made large volume share acquisitions over the past several months. \nTheir partnership with Sobi, an international pharmaceutical juggernaut, is worth $100 million in\ninitial payments, and over $630 million in commercial and milestone payments. This deal alone\nis worth more than Selecta\u2019s entire market capitalization. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**POSITIONS**\n\n4,000 shares at $4.28, but I plan to increase my position this week.",

Sears is conducting a 368 (a) Tax reorganization which is simply the transfer of the assets and liabilities of one corporation to another corporation.\n\nMost people believe ESL bought Sears out of Bankruptcy in a 363 sale for $5.2 Billion and left minority bondholders and shareholders, but he did not. Sears Shareholders and Bondholders will get equity of Transform Holdco (New Sears) or paid off the sale of the unencumbered assets. (See Section 354)\n\nFurthermore, Sears is not just a \"Dying Retailer\" the unencumbered assets included:\n\n1. Innovel solutions (sold to Costco for $1Billion)\n2. Sears Home Services (For sale for $1 Billion)\n3. Diehard (Sold to AutoZone for $200M)\n4. Kenmore\n5. 1100 pieces of unencumbered real estate\n6. NOL's and tax credits with worth at least $2.2 Billion\n\nCollectively these assets are valued at over $5 Billion after all remaining debt is paid, This translates into at least $17-$25 a share (not including any lawsuit proceeds from the ESL v SHLDQ Lawsuit.\n\nThe largest shareholder is Eddie Lampert (48.4%) the largest debtholder is also Eddie Lampert (80-90%) and he has not sold any of his stock or unsecured bonds, this is a HUGE TELL. No selling from $120 dollars down to a low of .12 cents.\n\n* Mainstream media talks exclusively about the dying retail division, but the other subsidiaries are highly profitable, but this was hard to see with the retail division losing so much.\n\nSHLDQ is the best most misunderstood investment I have ever seen, I think the bankruptcy will be over by January 2022, this gives us plenty of time to buy. I have studied it Sears Holdings for about 4.5 years, the brick and mortar retailer is only ONE part of Sears.\n\nThe best returning distressed stocks have majority owner/operators with major skin in the game and no incentive to wipe out the other shareholders, or unsecured bondholders, and SHLDQ is such a company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.scribd.com/document/488944576/Sears-Holdings-How-to-Buy-17-Dollars-for-17-Cents-OTCMKTS-SHLDQ-FINAL](https://www.scribd.com/document/488944576/Sears-Holdings-How-to-Buy-17-Dollars-for-17-Cents-OTCMKTS-SHLDQ-FINAL)",

        "selftext": "**Episode 2: Using Options to protect your crown jewels when the market starts to fall**\n\nThere are many ways in which Options can be traded, for income, profit, loss, insurance or to subsidise a Stock purchase and in this, the 2nd of my introductory series on Options, I\u2019ve decided to going to cover off why you might want to buy a PUT on either an individual stock or indices to cover and protect your \u2018long\u2019 positions.\n\nSo what is a PUT exactly?\n\nAt its simplest a PUT is a type of Option you buy (or *sell* \\- see Episode 3 next Monday) which can make you money when a stock or the market is going down. (NB: You don\u2019t actually need to own a stock to buy a PUT, it just depends on whether you want to run around the market \u2018sans underwear\u2019 and risk your private assets for no good reason \u2013 other than profit! :-) Joking aside however, the purpose of this post is to explain how the financial \u2018instrument\u2019 known as a PUT - loved and hated in equal measure, can be used for the purpose for which it was originally conceived.\n\nTiming is pretty much everything when working with the stock market and that becomes 100 x more critical when you start trading Options. Buying a PUT at the wrong time (i.e. when the market or your stock is going upwards) is unlikely to win you many admirers and can be detrimental to your relationship if you have a shared brokerage account! J But as I mentioned in the first Episode of this series on the Covered CALL, a single Option = 100 shares; a relationship often referred to as \u2018leverage.\u2019 As such, and if you had 100 shares in Apple for example, another trader could achieve a similar holding ON A TIME LIMITED BASIS for just 1% of the money you paid for those Apple shares (less spread and commission); tempting isn\u2019t it - $13,000 odd of stock for just $1,300. The problem however, is that at some point in the future (and unlike the Stock), an Option expires and then becomes valueless \u2013 a time few investors relish. Also, when multiple Options expire at the same time it\u2019s known as a \u2018Witching\u2019 or even a triple Witching when stock Options, stock index futures and stock index options expire at the same time - Fun, fun, fun for the boys and girls on their Option broomsticks sans underwear, but not do good for anyone else! :-)\n\nOn the plus side however, and with a 99% theoretical leverage on your money, a PUT will gain value rapidly whenever the market or the stock it relates too goes down, and even after taking the \u2018spread\u2019 into account (that\u2019s the difference between the \u2018buy\u2019 and the \u2018sell\u2019 price of the Option) it typically delivers anywhere from a 65: 1 to 75:1 return (profit or loss), so it\u2019s a cheap way to insure your portfolio against a V shaped dip. It would be fair to say that PUT purchased and sold for the right reasons *at the right time* can go a long way towards protecting your crown jewels (Stocks) against temporary stock market downdrafts, and at the wrong time is a ruddy nuisance J\n\nSo what\u2019s the catch?\n\nThere\u2019s more than one actually :-)  Firstly, neither stocks nor indices tend to travel up or down in nice predictable patterns \u2013 if they did, we\u2019d all be minted by now and I probably wouldn\u2019t these articles from the cupboard under the stairs! :-)\n\nWhen you buy a PUT, it will bounce around your ticker from red to green (and then back to red again), :-) in much the same way that you would if you suddenly decided to take a stroll across a hot bed of coals to impress your friends here on Reddit, and just like those hot coals and your pretty little feet, it\u2019s painful, unnerving and it doesn\u2019t smell too good either! :-) But joking aside, let\u2019s run some scenarios to show how this defensive strategy might not do what you\u2019d like it to do;\n\na) Imagine your stock takes a sharp dive and up goes your PUT (65: 1 after the spread). You call your Partner and rave about your natural genius and unrivalled flare, but by the time the phone call ends and you return to your screen, you discover that the Stock has actually recovered and that pesky PUT you were just raving about has sent your ticker back in the red again! (what's the betting you don\u2019t ring them back and confess your sins!?) J (I appreciate you could put a STOP order SELL order on your Options but due to the ways these things bounce around, it\u2019s not always an ideal strategy to do so \u2013 see b) for why.\n\nor\n\nb) Maybe your stock takes that proverbial dive again but this time bottoms out and bounces along the floor for a few minutes, then you see the candlesticks starting to change, confirming that the recovery is imminent so you sell your PUT on a wave of GREEN \u2013 Yipee! J - Only to discover that for reasons unknown, the candle has melted and your Stock is now launching itself off a vertical cliff with all your money to oblivion! You start to wonder if the PUT *knew* it was about to be dumped and in a last act of revenge at your unfaithfulness, waited till the last possible moment when you had taken off the parachute before sticking in the boot? (It happens believe me, and it\u2019s a very weird feeling when it does, as if someone at the brokerage firm (aka Casino) was watching your moves and had set you up) . . . :-)\n\nBut please don\u2019t be put off (no pun intended - honest) J Buying a PUT can be a great idea, and when successfully deployed can protect your assets against downdraughts in both theory and in practice, but working with one is not as straight forward as anyone would like; it\u2019s a bit like riding a Tandem (bicycle) with a drunk co-pilot in the lead, you both know timing is everything and where you want to get too, but getting there seems frustratingly elusive (and you keep falling off in the road!) :-)\n\nA PUT can and will protect you and it\u2019s a great defensive play but don\u2019t stay in one for too long unless you know that crash in your assets is both imminent and ongoing! Timing remember is everything (x100) and walking on hot coals hurts!\n\nNext Monday, I\u2019ll take a closer look at using a PUT as a way to buy an underlying stock you want and get paid for the privilege, but until then; stay safe \u2018guys\u2019 and watch the market right now, it\u2019s looking a bit choppy out there.

        "selftext": "The question of when or what to sell is a concept that every investor will come across regardless of how knowledgeable or skillful one may be. Ideally, when an individual is approaching Mr. Market with sound fundamentals and a strong sense of rationality, there will be five key matters which they have already taken into consideration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.)  The General Price Level\n\na.) Being able to determine roughly how over/undervalued the market is should provide an individual with some perspective on the amount of risk they should be taking. Defining risk is quite difficult as there is not a concrete definition which a majority of investors can agree upon. I see risk as to the stability of a companies earnings power and business model in a wide variety of conditions. During a bull market, many companies still remain undervalued, but those with a more sensitive or complex business model will in my opinion carry more risk compared to a staunch consumer defensive, even if both companies share the same margin of safety. Bear markets provide an opportunity to increase risk. It is only when overall sentiment is quite negative that I would favor a slightly more sensitive and complex business over that of a consumer defensive. Consumer defensives provide cushions on the way down and can offer sizable dividends to help steadily build up cash positions during bull markets.\n\nb.) Essentially the idea I have explained above is to purchase undervalued consumer defensives during good times and to take more risk with more complex and sensitive companies during bad times. Yet I have not explained when I think one should sell. From personal experience, utilizing the margin of safety but in the opposite direction can offer some guidance. Positions with more risk who have a negative margin of safety in excess of 15% (overvalued by 15% or more) should be gradually reduced from your portfolio during the upper heights of a bull market. Consumer defensives and strong brands are best held unless significantly overvalued with a negative margin of safety of 20% or more. In some regards, these companies are justified with a higher valuation as a result of intangible assets like brand, moat, and leadership. Often times companies like this tend to maintain their fair value in times of turmoil which is why it's best to show reluctance when selling them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) Business Profits\n\na.) It is imperative that an investor understands the exact source of a companies earnings. A company may have good earnings, but being unaware of the source of said earnings can leave an investor vulnerable to unexpected changes in certain conditions. A current example of this would be individuals on this sub praising Visa for strong earnings while simultaneously stressing the dire situation of our economy. Visa's earning sources are incredibly sensitive to customers' abilities to pay bills, so in an incredibly severe recession, it is likely that at some point their earnings will take a substantial hit. Although this may not happen, it is out of my control whether or not it does, meaning the risk is something I cannot control and thus am not comfortable having exposure to. If a companies price has advanced or remained the same, yet the source of their earnings is adversely affected by negative conditions, it is likely best to sell. People have criticized Warren Buffet for selling airlines, yet airlines collectively lost more than 25 billion since the pandemic has started. It makes sense to have sold.\n\nb.) As I have laid out in a previous post discussing George Soro's theory of reflexivity, high stock prices do have the ability to alter fundamentals. The example I used was Tesla, whose recent earnings have come not from cars, but from carbon credits. Additionally, their most recent factory expansions have come not as a result of strong earnings and an incentive to expand, but from the issuance of common stock at elevated prices. Had their stock price remained stagnant, their fundamentals would have continued to deteriorate. Yet participants of the market have altered the fundamentals through a strong sense of loyalty for the stock which has substantially increased the price. What is the point of these new factories when the old ones were still unable to turn a profit? Tesla was also close to bankruptcy multiple times, yet there has been no change other than a small increase in cash that will prevent the same thing from happening in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.) Interest rates\n\na.) I laid out my opinion on low rates and valuations in a previous post, but essentially low rates only justify increased valuations if cash flows remain stable and don't take a hit. If the business model and earnings decreases due to a deterioration of economic conditions, then a higher valuation, is not necessarily warranted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4.) Dividends\n\na.) Many individuals try to justify extreme valuations of companies by comparing the risk-free rate of T-bills to dividend yields. This argument immediately falls apart when explaining how companies should command a significantly higher yield overly t-bills as any private company is extensively more risky than the US Government. When doing a DCF model, if you use a risk-free rate in your calculations you are essentially laying out that the asset valued has the same amount of risk as the US Goverment. Buffet can do this because the knowledge he possesses in his area of expertise is so great that he can confidently assign a propper risk profile to the asset he is attempting to value. If you are new to security analysis, use a larger discount rate to compensate for any potential error or mishaps you may implement in your calculations. If the asset valued still trades with a significant margin of safety after using a larger discount rate, it's likely that your investment will carry diminished risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5.) Security Price Movements\n\na.) A large spike in general volatility across the entire market should entice an investor. Stretches of time with low volatility across the entire market should drive away an investor as it likely means that there is a substantial amount of buying going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I will continue to add to this post when I have more time later today",

        "selftext": "For background, I'm 20. The markets have been very exciting lately. Huge gains have been made....but also huge losses. I am in the latter group. I saved money for most of my life, and started investing during 2020 after the pandemic hit. I didn't want to trade, I wanted to just get long term investments and hold them. And that did work out pretty well. I was down red at certain points, but it was never SERIOUS drops, and I was confident that my picks were good in the long run. I wouldn't go into details about the weighting, but my portfolio essentially contained AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, SQ, NKE, ARKK, PLTR, NVDA, WMT, COST, DIS, JNJ, PG, V, and a couple other small picks that were my \"fun\" stocks - I actually had a few dozen APHA shares at $6. I had heavy tech weighting, but I was confident in the long term prospects. \n\nBy this year, just about everything was in the green, and collectively up around 15%. Then came BB. BB looked appealing so I sold most of my stocks that had been moving sideways for a while (AMZN, MSFT, NVDA) and put the money into BB when it was low teens. Within a couple days, it hit the 20s and I sold for thousands in profit. The fact that I made thousands of dollars by doing nothing was crazy to me. The rest of my portfolio was also up several thousand dollars (overall, my profit was around $7000 at this point - a combination of the realized gains from BB and the unrealized gains from everything else). \n\nThen came GME. Several months ago, I neglected GME because I did not think they were a good long term investment, and so I did not buy them when they were less than $20/share. So when I saw the stock jump to 40, and 60 in the span of hours, I thought that was crazy. So what did I do? Naturally, I got FOMO when the stock was almost $400 and bought into the hype because I actually believed in what people over at another subreddit were saying. Within a week, my portfolio dropped around 80% (roughly $20,000). I thought that would be the best learning experience for me, but I bought into the weed hype this week, and have lost another few thousand dollars. All in all, I've lost 90% of my money in the past month. I'm young so I can recover, and this wasn't money I needed urgently. But my money I worked for and saved is completely gone because of my decisions. \n\nI'm writing this mostly for myself because I needed a reality check for myself and don't have anyone to talk to. I can't sleep at nights, and can't really focus on anything else. I've lost all interest in playing video games, and my grades are starting to take a hit. This is really embarrassing for me, and nobody knows I lost my money on stocks (nor do I want them to). I don't know if anyone needs to here this, but please be careful with your money, and don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Especially for young investors, we have such a long time horizon. There's no need to try and get rich quick. Conservative investing will compound over our lives.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nLast weekend I created a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?), in which I documented which brokers stopped people from purchasing specific securities, and which ones didn't.\n\nBefore it gets forgotten, I want to bring that list back again, and insist that you get a new broker if yours is one of the bad ones.\n\nThis is a much, MUCH bigger issue than you think, and this can and WILL affect you eventually, if you stay with a broker that decides that you cannot trade a security that they don't want you to trade. Note that the securities affected were not just meme stocks, several large stocks some of you might own or have heard about were restricted and their price was thus manipulated, including:\n\n- General Motors\n- Rolls Royce\n- Trivago\n- Workhorse Group\n- Jaguar Health\n\nAnd [many more](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html).\n\nWhen boomer stocks get affected, this means the entire free market is at risk and the next time this happens you might be the one unable to trade your favorite stock if you continue using a bad discount broker. \n\n**Whether this is the broker's fault or their clearinghouse's fault is irrelevant, the result is your inability to engage in the free market.** This behavior needs to be punished to ensure other brokers don't start doing the same thing.\n\nHere is my list of brokers which I will continue to update, as per the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/?):\n\n\n### Horrible Brokers -

        "selftext": "I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:\n\n1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.\n2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&amp;P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&amp;P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the \"value\" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&amp;P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)\n3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability &amp; Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine \"quality\" and \"value\" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&amp;P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!\n4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to \"Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.\"  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past year!\n5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!\n6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.\n7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.\n8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH &amp; TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&amp;P 500 upside during \"normal\" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.\n9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.\n10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.\n\nok, here's a bonus #11:\n\n11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.\n\nDisclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.\n\nWhat do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up!

This company should see strong near-term price increases and I expect at least **8-12x** growth in the next 24 months. As of this writing the share price is sitting at **$0.50**.\n\nBefore you read any further, I want you to understand what I look for in an investment; I invest in companies that are undervalued, possess world changing technology and have a large potential catalyst, be it financial changes, a market inflection point, buy out or pending regulatory approval. For it to make sense to me, the company must provide me with a large near-term upside and continued long-term growth. Basically, I am looking for penny stocks that should not be. Kraken fits all these requirements for me and is just starting to pick up speed in the industry. I will continue to update this, but I feel that it will be moving quickly so I would like to get this in front of everyone\u2019s eyes ahead of time.

[(6) Release the Kraken - Autonomous Vehicles, AI, Battery &amp; Sensor Tech, RaaS and clean energy play : trakstocks (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/lm102y/release_the_kraken_autonomous_vehicles_ai_battery/?sort=new) \n\n**About** Kraken Robotics is a 6-year-old robotics company specializing in autonomous vehicles, high-end, software-centric sensors, subsea batteries, and thrusters for military and commercial customers. They are now providing AI assisted RaaS (Robots as a service) and they are transitioning their business model to focus on recurring revenue from subsea data acquisition and data analytics.\n\nTheir key areas of innovation are **autonomous vehicles**, **battery and sensor technology**, **AI data analytics and robotics as a service** (RaaS)\n\nKraken is an up-and-coming player that has gone from a workforce of 20 to over 150 in the past couple of years as they have been acquiring companies and their technology while expanding their operations. They are a growing presence in the 10-billion-dollar underwater vehicle market, ranked by [Deloitte](https://www.thetelegram.com/business/local-business/kraken-robotics-leads-east-coast-tech-companies-on-canadas-fastest-growing-list-521886/) as the fastest growing tech company on the East coast (Canada).\n\n**Financials -** Kraken\u2019s financial will change drastically in mid-April when they release their 2020 Q4 which will show a 40 million dollar contract they received. This contract alone is equal to half their market cap.\n\nTheir current revenue stream supports a **$1 price point**, with a $6 price point factoring in unrecognized contracts, continued sector growth with similar contract capturing. I see $1 in the next 6 weeks and $3 by end of year.\n\n**Market cap of 86.33M** 165.01M outstanding shares and an extremely low float of only 112.29M \u2013 insider ownership sits right around 30%. Con- there is no real institutional ownership. [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KRKNF?p=KRKNF&amp;guccounter=1)\n\n\\*\\*Typical volume for Kraken has been about 178k a day, the recent contract news has pushed this to **1.3m today**, telling me it is ready to move on up. The lack of attention this company has received is a major reason for its low price point.\n\nKraken raised 10m in October 2020 to expand its robotics as a service business, on leasehold improvements, equipment, parts and inventory and possible future acquisitions.\n\n[Q3 Fiscal 2020](https://krakenrobotics.com/themencode-pdf-viewer/?file=https://krakenrobotics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kraken-Q3-2020-Financial-Statements.pdf)\n\n[Management Discussion and Analysis Q3](https://krakenrobotics.com/themencode-pdf-viewer/?file=https://krakenrobotics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kraken-MDA-Q3-2020.pdf)\n\n**Products -**\n\n**Autonomous Vehicles**\n\n\u00b7 AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles)\n\n\u00b7 USV (unmanned surface vehicles)\n\n\u00b7 Towfish (Towed underwater vehicle)\n\n\u00b7 ROV (remotely operated vehicle)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/naunop6x33i61.jpg?width=747&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6ce4b19e025060e204dc83fe61b0f78e89d96c1\n\n**Katfish subsea pressure neutral batteries**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img z0pvh20y33i61...*\n\n**Software-Centric Sensors \u2013** These innovative sensors provide ultra-high-resolution imagery of the sea floor, think of it as GoogleMaps \u2013 water edition.\n\n\u00b7 **SaS Sonar**\\-synthetic aperture sonar provides 15x high image resolution than conventional side scanning sonar, with larger coverage area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img v226xdkz33i61...*\n\n**\u00b7 Seavision** \u2013 1st ever full color 3-D underwater laser with real-time processing, live video streams and\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img fb0t40z043i61...*\n\n**Rim Mounted Thrusters**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img relqerf243i61...*\n\n**Market and Application \u2013** Representatives of Kraken Robotics, the underwater vehicle market could be worth $10 billion annually by 2025.\n\nThe military market encompasses naval mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. They believe this could be a US$4 billion market by 2025.\n\nThe commercial market includes far more, cable &amp; pipeline surveys, subsea mapping, oil rig and offshore wind and wave energy asset inspection, maintenance repair and environmental monitoring.

HF have been stealing from retail investors through [illegal tactics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp) as the ones we see all this week and for years, this is our moment to make them pay for all the did.  \n\n\nI know when this start to show the real value a lot of us are going to want to sell to recover the initial invest, but remember there's fellow who put their live

in that let\u2019s be real and together billions*), or don't receive support to transfer your money in order to ditch it, cancel your account with all your money in it for no reason, etc, put a

look like the good ones, we need those fake brokers to go down, they sell our data to the corrupt HF, no more robbery.\n\n\\- Don't waste your time sending reports to the SEC about this case, these corrupt dogs are in HF side too, if not, they would have already done something with how obvious all this is.\n\n\\- No sell GME neither AMC [until we get what we deserve,](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lkal7q/warning_there_are_several_people_trying_to/) they must pay for all the money they have been stealing from us, not lower after they conducted a daylight robbery for years.\n\n\\- Finance laws need to be updated to the new era in order to avoid corrupt HF like these ones keep destroying business and keeps stealing from us. \n\n\\- Downvote all

corrupt mods and HF stocks.(if you buy those stocks they see you as stupid, they just push and dump to keep taking your money)\n\n\\- Keep doing and posting when you do charity with your tendies in

But if your DD doesn't hold water, then it truly is dumb.\n\n# tl;dr It's great you love GME as a stock, I hope they do great and think they'll make a great turnaround.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'll start off by saying this is not financial advice, do you baby. I'll also say I'm NOT an expert. I had some experience trading before the GME hype, mainly in ETFs, and I've taken Finance courses in college, but that's it. \n\nIn any case, I noticed how weirdly correlated the GME Volume and Price were as I watched my gambling money wash away. But that was purely anecdotal. So I wrote a simple script to pull the Volume and Price of 10 stocks, including GME and AMC, every 60 seconds or so. [This was pulling directly from Yahoo! Finance, here's GME as an example](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/). The script was just looking for the Volume and Price on each stock's page. The tickers I chose are:\n\n* AMC\n* ATVI\n* GM\n* GME\n* JPM\n* SNDL\n* SNOW\n* TSLA\n* UPS\n* V\n\n\nThe criteria was just \"fairly popular stocks\", so if you all have suggestions of other stocks you'd want to see, feel free to comment.\n\n\nI left this script running from 1:47 PM until 7:02 PM, which gave me a total of 210 observations per stock. The scrape failed twice, once for GME and once for ATVI, so I have 209 observations for those.\n\n\nWhat I found was surprising to me, but I am not savvy enough to know if this is a \"sign\" of anything. So I'm leaving it up to you apes. [Here's an album with the Regression Analysis results from each of those tickers](https://imgur.com/a/U7myXa2). You'll notice that the R^2 for GME is off the charts, at 90.7%. The second highest is TSLA, with 70.9%, followed by UPS, at 68.5%. \n Here's a general definition of R^2 : \n&gt;R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.\n\nHere are the R^2 values for all 10 stocks (all in the album above):\n\n* AMC: 0.6766\n* ATVI: 0.579\n* GM: 0.0012\n* GME: 0.907\n* JPM: 0.6203\n* SNDL: 0.3488\n* SNOW: 0.0948\n* TSLA: 0.7087\n* UPS: 0.6852\n* V: 0.39\n\n\nI believe this is telling us that there is an extremely strong correlation between the Volume movement and the Price movement, so as the volume goes up, price goes up, as the volume goes down, price goes down. This relationship is also much much stronger than in any other stock. So what can/does this mean? I cannot conclude if this is shady or not, but with everything else going on (weird sub behavior, media blitz, RH being ass), I can't help but think this is odd. And my point here is not to claim I've made some ground-breaking discovery, I'm looking to use the data we have available to better assess my GME position. My current \"reasoning\" for holding is that there's a lot of \"weird\" things going on and each one is getting brushed off individually as \"maybe it's this, maybe it's that\". The point of this post is to add to that weird pile (what your wife's bf calls you).\n\nPS: I understand this is an overly simplistic model, with one variable. I also understand my observations are from one day and the sample size is not large enough to make perfect conclusions.\n\n#####EDIT: If anyone knows a safe, **anonymous**, way of sharing this data, I'm happy to post it",

        "selftext": "First off, this isn't your normal DD post. I am not going to breakdown the financials of the business, but I will tell you why I think psychedelics are the next to get pumped. I will say, I am not the originator of this idea and I received valuable insight from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShRX-x8YBg) video from Andrei Jikh, my favorite finance YouTuber. \n\nSimply put, the reason I am a believer both in the long-term and in the short-term is because: \n\n**Promising results for curing depression** \n\nToday's teens are at higher risk than anybody for suffering from symptoms of depression, not even taking in consideration the new statistics that will come out from the pandemic. I am expecting a jump from the estimate of 20% of all teens experiencing depression. Additionally, today's anti-depressants are usually ineffective or come with horrible side effects. The mental health industry knows they need another way to help because SSRIs simply don't work well and they are not for everybody. It is actually common to have treatment-resistant depression, which is bullshit. \n\n**Ideal for meme culture**\n\nIt only makes sense that after the hype from weed stocks, the degenerates from WallStreetBets will run over and play with psychedelics. The weed stocks are going to be a gateway into other drug stocks, if you will. The boomers were right! \n\nOn top of that, I am already seeing everybody claiming psychedelics as the next meme stock. They are calling it \"the shroom boom,\" which is amazing. \n\n**Personal experiences** \n\nThe reason I am a believer in the power of how  psilocybin mushrooms and different fungi can effect the brain is because a majority of my friends give me an in-depth analysis of their trips. They mainly state that if they need to clear their head from something that is bothering them deep down, shrooms will force you to face it, learn from it, and move on. This is how many researchers have come to believe it will have a positive effect on the mental health community.\n\n**Beating the rush** \n\nBottom line is that we are still early to the party. The first ever psychedelic ETF (PSYK) hasn't even been listed in the U.S. yet. It debuted in Canada a few weeks ago. The psilocybin research companies are just getting into the business and filing their IPOs.\n\n**Big players our side** \n\nIt is well-known that Kevin O'Leary is heavily invested in psychedelics and his YouTube channel is filled with videos in support of medicinal psilocybin.  \n\n*But which stock should I buy?* \n\nPersonally, I believe there are two big players that have the best chances of succeeding. \n\n## Compass Pathways (CMPS)\n\nThis company is a therapy company that is focused on psilocybin research. They have quickly become the center of attention because their recent IPO. The reason for their recent success has been obtaining the approval from the FDA, which is massive for continuing their research on treatment-resistant depression. \n\n## Mind Medicine (MMEDF)\n\n This company is focusing on psilocybin research, but mainly as an aid for battling opioid dependency. This company has been highly touted by Canopy Growth CEO Bruce Linton. This is going to sound stupid, but in my opinion, this company has the most potential for the shroom boom because of its' slick name and cheap price. It really does appeal to this age of new investing!",

        "selftext": "Hello options people.  With all the new blood in the options community, I thought it was worthwhile to update my Options guide and re-post it.  It has significantly more content than last time.  This should be really useful for newer traders, I hope it helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent a huge amount of time learning about options and tried to distill my knowledge down into a helpful guide.  This should especially be useful for newbies and growing options traders.\n\nWhile I feel I\u2019m a successful trader, I'm not a guru and my advice is not gospel.  This will hopefully be a good starting point, teach you a lot, improve on your existing skills (if you already know the basics), and make you a better trader.  I plan to keep typing up more info from my notebook, expanding this guide, and posting it every couple months.  \n\nAny feedback or addition requests are appreciated\n\n*Per requests, I added details of good and bad trades I made.  Some painful lessons learned are now included.  I also tried to organize this better as it got longer.*\n\nThis guide has gotten so big it is too long for one reddit post, so now it\u2019s two parts.

This is imperative since it's attrition when buying and a payout when selling. [ https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta](https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta)\n* DTE: Days till expiration/expiry\n* Understand delta in general and how delta changes with ITM and OTM options.\n* Understand all the Greeks at a high level, as you get better understand them well.  The Greeks: [https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/)\n* Options positions with respect to price:\n   * ITM: In the money; strike is below stock value.\n   * ATM: At the money; strike is just at or above the stock value, often very highly traded.  Can be very effective with moderate - long term expiry.  If the stock moves favorably, an ATM option\u2019s delta will rapidly increase.\n   * NTM: Near the money; strike is above the stock value, but fairly close.  Slightly unofficial term.\n   * OTM: Out of the money; price is at least a few strikes from the current stock price.  I would say 10-30% over stock price.\n   * Very OTM: Not a real definition, this is essentially a lottery ticket.  Cheap, but almost certain to expire worthless unless there is explosive movement.\n* IV, IV crush, and how IV affects pricing.  In general, you want to sell when IV is high and buy when the IV is low.  Increasing  IV is good for held calls/puts.  IV drop or crush is generally good for sellers.\n* Selling options can be quite beneficial.  Once you have a good general understanding, lookup r/thetagang .  Kamikaze Cash has good YouTube videos on most theta strategies (linked above).  I personally believe selling options (especially cash secured) is much safer and can consistently make you profits.  \u0398 Gang 4 life.\n* FOMO and how to avoid chasing a dangerous trend.  DO NOT CHASE FROM FOMO!\n* What intrinsic and extrinsic value are.  Know how they are affected by being exercised/assigned and how theta affects them.\n* Understand that some WSB recommendations are straight up high-risk gambling and factor in that information accordingly.  Be careful with Meme stocks and the survivor-ship bias on YOLO plays.  However, I love the sub and think it\u2019s hilarious.  It has a lot of valuable information / DD if you are comfortable with the \u201ccolorful\u201d language.  It\u2019s also great if you like rocket ship emojis.\n\n## Basics / Mechanics\n\n* Understand the 4 \"main\" option types.  Buying or selling a call and buying or selling a put.  Spreads and more complex multi-legged option strategies are based off these in some way (see below)\n* You can sell calls with 100 shares of stock or if you own an underlying longer term option; see LEAPS and PMCCs later.  Selling calls naked is incredibly risky and often requires Level 4 (very advanced) permissions and usually a lot of capital.  I will literally never sell calls naked since I don't want to ruin my life and end up living in a dumpster eating saltine crackers.\n* Puts can be sold/written cash covered (cash secured), which means you have the cash in your account to buy 100 shares.  Your broker will put this money on hold until the trade is closed.  Puts can be sold \"naked\" using Margin and Level 3 (with most brokers).  Your broker will hold a percentage of cost of 100 shares (often 30-40%, 100% on meme stocks) allowing you to sell more puts.  This increases your available capital/power as well as increasing risk.\n\n# General Tips and Ideas:\n\n* Don't EVER leave (short) spreads open on expiration day, close them.  (more details below)\n* Start off trading very small.  Slowly build up over weeks / months.  You need to get accustomed to a fifty dollar swing a day, then a few hundred, then a few thousand.  You need to ensure you don't get emotional (see below).  I started trading options with 5k, then 25k, 50k, and later over 100k.  I added my own funds over time and used my gains to build my account.  Don\u2019t go all in immediately, that\u2019s dangerous and unwise.\n* Especially as you build up the amount of money you have invested, keep it diversified among several stocks.\n   * Don't go all in on one thing, ever.  Be able to take a hit from one stock and not mortally wound your portfolio.\n   * A company may be doing great, then there's a major product issue out of nowhere.  If you are overexposed in one stock this can really hurt you.\n   * I had to roll options I sold that were about to expire completely worthless because FDX's CEO changed and the stock took a hard dip.\n* Don't trade emotionally.  If you realize you are emotionally trading for vengeance, you should probably exit the trade and cool off for several days with that stock.  Same if you get caught up in a wave of hysteria.\n* Planning Trades:\n   * Have a plan for every trade, ideally with entries / exits that are specific values, ranges, or a set condition.  This helps remove emotions.  This is super important for strong movements and high volatility (see later). \n   * Hedge fund guy on YouTube stated that trading should be 90% planning and 10% execution.  I agree with this more and more.\n   * My rough trading outline:\n      * Make a list of potentially viable stocks.\n      * Perform research.\n      * Set up a watchlist of stocks you want to trade.\n      * Have entry and exit plans for your trades.  Setting stock price alerts for entries is my personal preference.\n      * Market opens / event occurs.  React according to your plan.\n      * Based on new information, adjust, open, or close positions accordingly.\n* Use an options profit calculator from your broker or an online one before entering a \"new\" trade, especially a complex multi legged trade:[ https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)/\n* \u201cRolling\u201d an option:  \n Closing your existing option and opening a similar one at a different strike and/or expiration.\n   * Rolling a call \u201cUp\u201d would be selling a call you own and buying a cheaper call at a higher strike.\n   * Rolling a put \u201cDown and out\u201d closes your original one and buying or selling one at a lower strike at a longer expiry.\n   * Better broker interfaces have a literal \u201cRoll\u201d button.  I know E-trade does.  You can manually do it by selecting relevant contract legs.\n* If you have a losing trade, re-evaluate it.  If your initial assumption is definitely incorrect, close it.  Don't stay in losing trades forever and lose the entire value of the option over stubbornness.  If you re-evaluate and you think your assumption was right, hold, potentially consider adding another cheaper option (or buy another call / put).  Rolling out sold options can help here.\n* Don't try to day trade, especially with options.  It's statistically unlikely to be profitable.  Day-trading with options introduces extra liquidity risks and is dangerous, especially with spreads.\n* Try not to over-trade, you'll likely mis-time the market over time.  When I get emotional I over trade, then lose additional money on wash sales.  If you scale your entries into positions it should help alleviate your desire to exit positions when they turn badly against you.  Whenever I buy calls I do it at larger increments after W almost made me lose my hair; luckily it eventually came back.\n* NEVER enter a position on a stock you have no idea about, especially when you read about it online or heard about it from some rando.\n* At market open options contracts are often volatile and inflated.  Buying during this time can be more expensive.  Options are usually cheaper mid-day, I read somewhere 2-3PM is cheapest.  I\u2019ve had success around 12-1PM EST after prices settle.\n* Try wheeling on cheaper stocks once you get all fundamentals down.\n* When selling puts if you are very bullish consider \"doubling down\"; note this is higher risk.  Use the credit from your put sale to buy shares or a cheap call.  This can be roughly inversed with puts, except I wouldn't ever recommend shorting shares.\n* Learn from your mistakes.  You can\u2019t go back in time and beating yourself up (to a point) is useless.  Make a physical &amp;/or mental note of it so you don\u2019t do it again.  If you don\u2019t learn from it, then beat yourself up so you won\u2019t do it again.\n* If you have friends that like to trade, I find it helpful to discuss strategies and planned plays.  I talk openly with my close friends about my current holdings and planned trades, it helps keep me accountable.  If I get a wide-eyed look, I might be doing something excessively risky or stupid.  I\u2019ve over-leveraged myself in calls twice and I knew I shouldn\u2019t have done it both times.  When I tell my friends what I did and I\u2019m embarrassed, it exemplifies the face that I shouldn\u2019t have done it in the first place.  You will also get ideas for new strategies or plays from them.  It\u2019s good to stay versatile and use multiple strategies when appropriate.  \n Beware of group-think/echo chambers. \n* I recommend NEVER telling someone what to buy/sell and when.  I\u2019ll tell people MY plays or what I like and why, but I will not encourage them to emulate what I do.  Depending on the audience, I\u2019ll tell them my exact positions along with my exit and entrance strategy.  With closer friends I\u2019ll offer my thoughts on their trades (if asked).  If my friend is doing something really risky (one of my friends does some scary stuff) I may ask them if they want my advice, and provide it, especially if they overlooked a risk/event.  I will not encourage someone to execute/enter a trade since it has a high potential for hurt feelings or animosity all around.\n* Don\u2019t fall in love with a stock.  \n Just because something made you money before and you have high confidence in it doesn\u2019t mean it will keep performing.  I joke that FDX betrayed me when it started dipping and losing me money.  I was over-confident of its bounce-back and sold too many puts too quickly.  I\u2019m in several losing trades because of it.  However, I will keep good stocks in my roster/tracking list or try different strategies or re-enter trades when they change their behavior.\n* As you start to both buy and sell options and get more experience in general, you'll start seeing the two sides to every trade.  You will likely start adjusting your strategies or trying new trades out because of this.  Things will likely click one day.  Most/all the Greeks and options concepts will become almost second nature.  For me this was when I could build an Iron Condor from scratch, which was a watershed moment involving a good understanding of many strategies.\n* Understand Liquidity and volume.\n   * Trading in low volume, low open interest contracts results in wide bid/ask spreads and difficulty having your contracts filled.  Look at all the data for a contract, not just the strike and price.\n   * Monthly Expiration dates typically have better liquidity.\n   * Multi-legged trades (Common examples are 2-legged vertical spreads or 4-legged iron condors) have more difficulty being filled, especially on bad brokers like Robin Hood.  Having very liquid options for all legs is extremely helpful in obtaining timely and well-priced fills, which maximize your potential profits.\n* Time in market vs timing the market:\n   * It is extremely difficult to time the market perfectly.  If you wait for the perfect opportunity forever, history has proven you will miss out on gains.  Keeping all your money out of the market has proven to be ineffective.  Now if there is something serious happening with a stock/the market (like say a new pandemic), don\u2019t go all in.  I recommend entering incrementally at dips.  If the stock has huge upside potential it may never go down, so it might make sense to partially enter at the current price.\n   * IMO selling puts is a great strategy to get into a stock you like, or at least make money off it.  I think buying stock in lots of 100 is usually for suckers.  Selling an ATM or ITM put (assuming the math works out) on a stock you were going to buy and hold is ALMOST free money.\n   * I recommend keeping some cash available regardless. If you have a very large account or expect a downturn, hedging with indexes like QQQ, SPY, or VIX or calls/puts may be wise.\n* Every trade can't be a winner.  You will take some losses, you must get used to it.  I don\u2019t like having a realized loss of 1K or more on any trade.  However, this will happen, especially with larger accounts.\n   * As long as you win more often and beat the S&amp;P that year I consider it okay.  I\u2019m kind of aggressive, so I consider 20%+ annually good.  30%+ annually is great.  40%+ and I\u2019m dancing.  After trading options I am almost baffled by my old belief that 5% annual returns (mostly from dividend ETFs) was \u201cgood\u201d.  That\u2019s nothing to me now since I\u2019m willing to take risks.  \nNote: While lots of people danced in 2020, realize that\u2019s an insane Bull Run year and is atypical. \n   * Adhere to your own risk tolerance and never over-extend yourself, especially with margin use.  Don\u2019t make huge gambles leaving you uncomfortable.  Only gamble with money you are willing to lose.\n   * My personal strategy is to make safer gains for the year and then enter slightly riskier strategies using those gains.  I can be slightly-moderately more aggressive and compound my gains.  For me I often sell puts to make money, then when I see a big opportunity I\u2019ll sell a put and buy an OTM or moderately ITM call.\n* Understand it\u2019s not safe to try and get rich overnight.  However, once you hit big \u201csteps\u201d things may start to snowball.  You can enter more positions and take more risks if you choose to.\n   * For me this when I hit 50k, then 100k.  I was able to balance low and moderate risk positions to more significantly grow my account.  I\u2019ll even do a high risk thing now and again because my gains can absorb it (assuming I have them).\n   * I can\u2019t wait to get to 250K, then 500K.  I know it\u2019ll take quite a long time, but I am confident I\u2019ll eventually be able to have 500K and (hopefully) 1M in my non-401k trading account with gains and additions from my job.  I can only imagine how \u201cdangerous\u201d I will be with that kind of capital.\n* If you missed \"the next big thing\" like AAPL, TSLA, or the time machine I\u2019m building in my basement.  Don't get upset, learn from it.  Adapt and become a better trader for next time.\n   * Figure out why a company was so promising, before they mooned.  Determine how you would have traded differently in hindsight.  Apply those lessons to the next company you believe has long term growth prospects.\n   * For me that's putting in 1-2.5k towards shares and/or buying LEAPS on it.  Depending on my bullishness I may buy \u201ccheap\u201d, fairly far OTM calls.  The far OTM options are sort of lottery tickets.  If I'm right the (relatively) low cost will have explosive profits; if I'm wrong, they didn't cost that much so it's a calculated loss I\u2019m willing to accept.  For more serious bets I\u2019ll buy ITM LEAPS to run PMCCs on.  I also like to buy 1-2K in my 401k for very long-term plays.\n* The stock market hates uncertainty, it seems to crave the status quo.  A shakeup can potentially tank a stock, even if it's nothing.  With shares you can wait it out, but this can be problematic for options.  If you see volatile/uncertain times ahead (politics, disease, manufacturing, earnings, etc.), you might want to reduce your overall portfolio risks or hedge.\n* Brokers:\n   * Find a good broker.  This article outlines good brokers that didn\u2019t restrict trading during the GameStop squeeze craziness.  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder\\_whether\\_you\\_own\\_gme\\_or\\_not\\_change\\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder_whether_you_own_gme_or_not_change_your/)\n   * I have personally used the following and here are my ratings:  \nE-Trade &gt;&gt; Fidelity &gt;&gt; Ally &gt;&gt; Robin Hood.\n      * The &gt;&gt; denotes they are significantly better.  Fidelity is reliable, but their interface isn\u2019t good.  The app / site both work, but they are clumsy, \u201cweak\u201d, and outdated.  It\u2019s been described as \u201cboomer-friendly\u201d by a Fidelity employee on Reddit.  Fidelity does have a \u201cpro\u201d type desktop software, it is geared toward more professional traders.\n      * Ally Invest has bad tools, is generally trash, and is unreliable, don\u2019t use it.\n      * RH is free, but has bad fills.  It is super unreliable and has had huge stock buying restrictions in stocks and quantities for multiple days.  I don\u2019t trade in their app anymore, but I do like using their wish lists for quick chart glances at daily activity.\n   * I really like E-Trade (and you\u2019re about to hear why).\n      * E-trade has Power E-Trade on both desktop and mobile.  These are fantastic tools for options trading.\n      * The mobile app destroys (most/all) other mobile apps in terms of organization, data available, and effectiveness.  I think it\u2019s phenomenal.  I can throw together a 4-legged trade in seconds.  I can easily see all Greeks, intrinsic/extrinsic value, volume, and every other trade parameter I need through their option chain screen by swiping left / right.\n      * *Note, I have not tried Schwab, just watched YouTube videos of their app.  From watching those, Power E trade looks better.*\n      * The desktop version also has a trade analyzer (extensive P/L calculator) and a strategy seeker.  The strategy tool gives you suggested trades based on your expected movement direction, expiry date, and amount invested.  Both are well done and powerful.\n      * These tools are so intuitive and powerful that I would have a hard time going to another broker, even if it\u2019s slightly cheaper.  Even if E-Trade drops the ball again, I might keep my main account with them and set up my secondary / backup account with Schwab; that\u2019s how much I like Power E-trade.\n      * **Noteworthy downsides.**  They restricted GME buying for \\~2 hours during market hours (\\~2-4PM) and all after hours on Thursday 1/28/21 when the GME craziness was happening.  This was the only restriction on buying I\u2019m aware of.  \nThe following week there was a day where I couldn\u2019t execute a trade for an hour at open.  This was during very high volume, but still no excuse.  These issues made me very angry with them.  These were the first big problems I\u2019ve had in several months of active trading through them.\n      * My biggest annoyance.  Power e trade sometimes shows spreads incorrectly arranged on mobile.  On desktop you can adjust / fix the spread groups with the \u201cCustom Groups\u201d button, but mobile sometimes mixes two spreads or condors with the same symbol and expiry.  This shows you different things than what you set up, but doesn't actually change what you own.  For example I could open a 170/175 put credit spread and sell a 180 put.  It might get confused on mobile and say 170/180 spread and 175 put.\n      * They are usually very reliable, but they are not perfect.  I\u2019m staying with them unless they have more major issues.\n      * Their options fees go from $.65 to .50 a contract once you trade enough, 30 trades / quarter I think.  They\u2019ll give you further discounts if you trade a lot for months, then call to ask for an option fee reduction/negotiation.\n      * If you decide to open an E-trade account and put enough money in, there is a new account incentive.  It scales up depending on your contribution.  If you feel like it, you can use my referral link.  PM me for it if you\u2019re interested.\n   * Rock Solid Brokers:\n      * Fidelity: Mediocre-bad tools, very reliable.\n      * Vanguard: Expensive.  Reliable.\n      * Schwab: OK prices.  Second hand, tools look okay-good.  Very good reputation and reliable.  If I ever decide to switch / diversify from E-trade, I\u2019m trying them.\n* Don\u2019t over leverage yourself, understand your own risk tolerance.  Don\u2019t use up all your cash or margin buying power.  Leave funds available to react if the market turns against you.  If you use margin maintenance, ensure you have a cushion to prevent a potentially costly margin call.\n\n# Profit Retention / Loss Mitigation\n\n* If selling options, it is a viable strategy to close early after a large gain with many DTE left until expiry.  See TT videos / strategies on this.\n* Don't hold options through earnings unless you literally want to gamble.  I like playing on earnings run ups, but that can be risky.\n* If you hold options through earnings, IV crush will happen immediately afterwards, devaluing the option.  However, if the option is profitable enough, IV crush won\u2019t matter, which will still make money for a call buyer.  A sold put sufficiently far OTM will benefit from IV crush, even if the stock dips after slightly bad or lukewarm earnings.\n* Don't throw good money after bad.  Don't gamble on a recovery if your assumption appears to be wrong or the market is flat out tanking.  If you are wrong and still believe in the company, wait twice as long as your original plan (wait for your 2nd entry point vs 1st) before adding to your position.\n* Consider using stop losses to lock-in profits on rides up or sometimes use them to prevent losses.  Note, stops can be easily triggered in volatile options.  Now when I'm up a lot on calls (especially around earnings or large momentum run-ups) I always set stop losses.  I have been burned too many times.  \n In December 2020 I didn't set a SL on several thousand dollars of FDX calls I was already up on and I \"lost\" \\~$5K of unrealized gains.   If you're up big, don't get too greedy.\n* A possible strategy if a stock is on a tear and you have multiple options open:  \nClose some positions (I prefer to do this incrementally if the stock has momentum), but leave 1+ open in case the stock goes into outer space/the floor.  Next, set a stop loss with a little buffer below its current movement / range so it doesn't get hit unless the stock falls hard.  Finally, watch the stock closely and if it keeps rising, keep moving the stop loss up in little bits incrementally.  This will let you keep more profits on a hot streak, but give some protection and secure more gains.  It will also help eliminate FOMO if a stock exceeds your expectations.\n* Have rules when to roll out, down &amp; out, or up &amp; out.  I like TT\u2019s roll at break even or at 1x loss and to always roll for a credit (or for me a very minor cost).  Obviously these rules need some monitoring.  Know your stocks, the news, and technicals so you don\u2019t jump the gun.  \n   * If you roll early for a credit and you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not the end of the world.  You\u2019ll just need to hold longer, which will obviously tie up capital.  Sometimes it\u2019s better to tie up some money (especially if you aren\u2019t paying interest) than eating a huge loss.\n   * Rolling too late can be worse though.  I currently have a very underwater FDX put I sold that is over 2x loss, rolling it does almost nothing unless you want to pay a debit or extend it extremely far out.\n* On huge options gains, **I strongly recommend taking profits by rolling up/down** or incrementally sell your contracts at several different prices (this is why having multiple contracts is nice).\n   * Rolling up involves selling your initial call, then using a fraction of your proceeds to buy a cheaper, further OTM call with the same expiry; puts are inverse this.  When rolling up I like to ensure the new option\u2019s cost is 15-40% of my realized gains.  I\u2019ll buy a more or less expensive replacement option based on my conviction in the stock and predicted movements.  You can also roll up and out to get a further expiry and strike.\n   * This is monumentally important if you are playing with incredibly high rising stocks or during a short squeeze.\n   * **Sad story time:**  \nI completely screwed up when I forgot to roll up, twice, during the GME gamma/short squeeze.  I didn\u2019t take my own advice; I didn\u2019t have a real exit or transition plan and I got emotional.  It all happened so fast and I was at work; the insanity of the run up and subsequent gamma squeeze caught me off guard.  I should\u2019ve clocked out and thought through the situation for 15-30 minutes to form an impromptu plan, then executed trade(s).  My moderate risk tolerance coupled with my desire to take profits took over.  When the stock partially cratered after a run up, I sold to retain gains.  In the heat of the moment I thought the squeeze was squoze and it was going to plummet into the ground and I wasn\u2019t being rational.\n      * On 1x 4K call I would\u2019ve made an additional 15-25K if I rolled up to a cheaper contract with some of my profits.\n      * I know I missed out on significantly more with a 2nd call I had.  Depending when I rolled it, it would likely have been an additional 25-50k in profits.\n   * I talked about learning from your mistakes above.  **This mistake is branded into my brain due to the massive gains I missed out on** **by not rolling up****.**  I\u2019m furious with myself as I write this 1 week after the GME gamma squeeze, I\u2019m a planner and I didn\u2019t plan.  If anything I own is significantly up ever again, I\u2019m rolling up (or at least setting a stop loss).  If necessary, I\u2019ll roll up a trade multiple times to keep extracting profits.\n   * Learn from my mistake so you don\u2019t miss out on gains too.  I strongly recommend rolling up when you are up big on a call / roll down when you are up big on a put.  This enables you to take profits, stay in the game, and keep extracting more gains.\n* If you trade a lot of options, talk to your broker about a discount.  I was getting the standard $.50/contract with E-Trade, but I traded over 300 contracts a quarter and was able to get the fee reduced by over $.10 by just asking.  I am now doing more spreads and condors, so once my volume gets very high, I\u2019ll ask again.\n* If you have a broker that isn\u2019t great and you want to switch, leverage your current trading fees to the new broker.  Tell them you\u2019ll move over $### thousand if they beat your current options trading fee per contract.\n\n# Trade Planning &amp; Position Management Tips\n\n* As you gain experience, start monitoring what kind of Delta, OTM, DTE, etc. you are most profitable with.  Use it in your future trades.  You'll often see the tasty trade 30-45DTE .3 Delta strategy for selling.\n* Having rough rules to close trades early can be a smart strategy.\n   * A common rule is if you hit 50% max profit in 1/3 of the contract length, close it early.\n   * A slightly more aggressive rule, that I roughly adhere to, is if you hit 66% max profit in \\~1/3 the contract length, close it early.\n   * If you sell \u201cnaked\u201d / on margin it may make sense to keep huge winners open, especially with sold/written puts.  I sometimes keep these big winners open with only 10-20% of the value left.  I let theta slowly bleed them dry to get extra money.  I\u2019m using my (free) naked put margin maintenance to get extra profits.  If other trades start to go bad, I\u2019ll close these big winners to free up capital.\n* Before entering a trade, look at rough technicals like resistances and supports to consider your relevant strikes as well as entry/exit points.  Look at upcoming earnings &amp; dividend dates as well as stock/market news.\n* Consider staggering strikes and expirations for safety and diversity; it\u2019s nice to avoid assignment on 3 puts at once because you used the same strike for all 3.\n* Incrementally enter positions on large rises/falls.  One of my favorite strategies is to buy dips after over reactions.  By doing this slowly in large price \"steps\" it helps combat FOMO and helps you avoid getting slaughtered.\n   * This will also help you avoid \"chasing a falling knife\".  It also ties into having a plan.\n   * I set alerts at several predetermined prices and I REALLY try not to enter new trades unless I hit my preset points.  It makes me less emotional and usually more effective.\n* Don't buy far expiration options with poor liquidity for shorter term plays.  I bought 1x GME 1-year+ LEAPS call before the 2021 short squeeze.  That was stupid, I should've bought 2-3x 60-120 day calls to have better liquidity.  I also paper-handed it and missed out on my lambo.\n* If selling options, consider rolling (for a credit) to avoid assignment when it makes sense / meets your plan.  Rolling closer to expiration can be a valid strategy to get theta on your side.  On the flip side, if the stock moons or plummets it could've been better to roll before it got crazy deep ITM.  See rolling \u201crules\u201d above.\n* Covered Calls:\n   * If a stock has a large movement range, I think it can be worthwhile to wait to open a CC after the last one is closed/expires.  I have been more successful waiting for another opportunity vs. opening one immediately on the Monday after the second the last one expires.\n   * Consider selling covered calls at all time highs/peaks.  If you sell a CC and the stock dips significantly, and you think it\u2019s temporary, you can buy to close your CC for a quick profit, then reopen it later.\n   * If you own Meme stocks, selling covered calls runs the risk of missing out on large gains.  On these stocks I typically only sell them further OTM than I normally would or not at all.  If I do sell CC on a Meme stock I try to ensure I have 25-100 other shares that won\u2019t be called away.\n* Dead cat bounce.\n   * After a huge price drop sometimes a stock will pop or partially recover temporarily.\n   * It could be a reversal or a false flag.  Be aware of this so you can react accordingly.\n   * [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/101700.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/101700.asp)\n* Finding stocks:\n   * u/swaggymedia publishes great lists of stocks at various price points with high and low IVs.  See r/SwaggyStocks, the new subreddit.\n   * Here are a few examples:\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kx6oh6/iv\\_report\\_high\\_iv\\_tickers\\_with\\_share\\_price\\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kx6oh6/iv_report_high_iv_tickers_with_share_price_under/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l3yzo0/weekend\\_iv\\_report\\_tickers\\_with\\_low\\_iv\\_and\\_cheaper/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l3yzo0/weekend_iv_report_tickers_with_low_iv_and_cheaper/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/l3yxn5/weekend\\_iv\\_report\\_stocks\\_with\\_high\\_iv\\_and\\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/l3yxn5/weekend_iv_report_stocks_with_high_iv_and_more/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kz5soi/iv\\_report\\_stocks\\_with\\_high\\_iv\\_and\\_more\\_expensive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kz5soi/iv_report_stocks_with_high_iv_and_more_expensive/)\n   * I recommend building a large roster of stocks you want to trade with and check it at least daily.  My \u201cwheel candidate\u201d list is 26 \u201csolid\u201d stocks plus 20-25 I\u2019m lukewarm about.  I want it to be at 100-200.\n   * With a large stock candidate list it makes it easy to find targets to buy dips on and exploit opportunities.  I like selling puts at dips with some downside protection.\n* Below is another reddit user's more aggressive theta gang variant.  I think this has merits, I'm trying it myself with a few stocks.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k\\_to\\_475k\\_in\\_4\\_months\\_using\\_theta\\_wsb\\_techniques/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k_to_475k_in_4_months_using_theta_wsb_techniques/)\n\n* Buying calls or puts with more DTE than you need is a very smart strategy IMO.\n   * Buying extra time becomes progressively cheaper after \\~1 month and keeps theta from hurting you as much.  See LEAPS later.\n   * I started off buying 30-45 DTE calls, then moved to 45-60 DTE.\n   * Now I am tinkering with only buying calls/puts that have 90-120+ DTE (monthlies).  I plan to close these with at least 30-45 DTE left since theta starts to really depreciate your contracts at 45 days, especially at 30 days.  If I\u2019m playing an event or a specific date, I ensure I have at least 30 days past that with whatever I purchase.\n   * Buying longer dated contracts, while more capital \u201cefficient\u201d, is more costly.  I couldn\u2019t do this when I had a small account.  There is also more downside risk; since the contract is more valuable, you can lose more.  I try to only have 1-3 calls open at a time in one stock so if I\u2019m wrong I don\u2019t get destroyed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI\u2019m not a financial advisor, I\u2019m not an engineer.

        "selftext": "KEY POINTS: (Please read) thank you\n\n1. Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the \"cause\" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers.\n2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying \"lets get this to $30\" or \"let get this to 100\". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.\n3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video &gt;&gt;&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)\n4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)\n\nFamiliarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.\n\n\\- They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.\n\n5. Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.\n\n6. Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.\n\n7. Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.\n\n8. What is short selling: &gt;&gt; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)\n\n9. Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)\n\n10. Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.\n\n11. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.\n\n12. Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.\n\nI hope this helps many.",

        "selftext": "Hello All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,  who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company  specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first  and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant  transposition of truck plans ready for production.FIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV SPAC, yet it has received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most EV SPACs. So what  gives?After doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding  back most investors back from committing to this great company is their  connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a  company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not  unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the  market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,  we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time  we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In  fact, it is quite the opposite \u2013 something that will help propel them  forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully  developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.\n\n# I.  The Team\n\nFirst,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come to know, a  SPAC is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about? After digging deeper  my questions were answered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The AllStars](https://preview.redd.it/7nuwaytesih61.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=545c748bd1fe6d8c68ced28d5ec2b3b14dab7bd2)\n\n***The Allstars*** ***-***\n\n**James (Jim) Taylor** \u2013 35+ years experience \u2013 CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**  he pivoted the company\u2019s focus from the electrification of cars and  SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now  known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).  Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.  Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,  which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the  powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and  what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has  some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to  EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and  Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing  different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build  improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as \u201cThe Great One\u201d when it  comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim \u201cThe EV Man\u201d Taylor,  because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and  innovating in the garage.\n\n**Jason Luo** \u2013 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.   Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now  Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies  in the world.  Oversaw the company\u2019s acquisition of Takata Corporation  for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of  Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.   He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more  importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few  different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows  what it takes to come out on top.\n\n**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,  Inc .  She previously led Google\u2019s automotive services program, during  which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into  automakers\u2019 new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board  of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.  One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a  group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**  (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I found on  their group website was called \u201cHigh-Potential Regions for Electric  Truck Deployments\u201d. It talked about geographical areas they want to  focus on and develop \u2013 one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.  This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry. Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.\n\n**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,   during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also  helped expand the company\u2019s international  footprint in many European  and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some  international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well  as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS\u2019s IPO in 1999, at  the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to  understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.\n\n**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.  Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware! Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).\n\n**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs \u2013 Director of Forum, Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many years of retailing, merchandising  and general management experience.\n\n**David Boris \u2013**  30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum Merger III Corporation. Has been  involved in approximately 20 SPAC transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.   Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well, despite it being one SPAC that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for FIII.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Players](https://preview.redd.it/ebsz6bygsih61.png?width=1227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd9ab4dfdaf343e54fd6ea5cd803f1358fe53a77)\n\n***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***\n\n***Jerry Hu***  \u2013 25+ years - COO , Safety expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**\n\n***Justin Prann*** \u2013 15+ years \u2013 CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.\n\n***Kev Adjemian*** **\u2013** 20+ years \u2013 CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**.

The fact that the Chinese companies that are  connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that  there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many  bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.\n\n# II. What Does ELMS Do?\n\nNow  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they  do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV companies  include:\n\n\u25aaFirst and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the opportunity of being alone  in the field.\n\n\u25aaFactory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production\n\n\u25aaCars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV SPACs aren't on the road until 2022 and later\n\n\u25aaLowest total cost of ownership in Class 1\n\n\u25aaAlready proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China\n\nHere is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note \u2013 this is from December so it may have changed some since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Only Class 1 - no other competition](https://preview.redd.it/fkf5byrjsih61.png?width=1719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=918b7c37a441b1dc5db3308cc03adde6b62b12a4)\n\nThe  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by 35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example, delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon, Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for these types of  vehicles.\n\nA cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business. This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets, shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom upfitting process allows  for :\n\n\u25aa \\~25% reduction time from order to delivery\n\n\u25aa One warranty single point of contact for customer\n\n\u25aa  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel, and Auto  Truck Group.\n\nI have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Custom Upfitting for any business needs. Takes out need for 3rd party.](https://preview.redd.it/ivxxq0ylsih61.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=046d1737914b20c2561b902b67e06b1df73f829d)\n\nNext,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :\n\n\u25aaProductivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles\n\n\u25aaOptimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance\n\n\u25aaCompliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports\n\n\u25aaExpandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins\n\nSome  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will  be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it. For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be more valuable for  both the company and their customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ion6yennsih61.png?width=1205&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90f939ab66bef8d563902529c59681d7de2aaa2b\n\n# III. Sales and Financials\n\nThe  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of 142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives us $1.71  billion.\n\nELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van, representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to 60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox + Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others. These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.\n\nThe ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in 2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. \u201cOur team collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of 100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand, establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.\u201d\n\nI  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000 preorders  being \u201ccontingent upon satisfaction of customer requirements.\u201d As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Companies ELMS is in talks with or has pre-orders from.](https://preview.redd.it/e70l425psih61.png?width=1724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4db1f03d707a18ffe69c02aa8a53ae4d24135ae4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.  Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the  mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed  results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on  creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new  ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite  possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring  more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas.\n\n*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area. Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan, Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County \u2013 it is very wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that \u201cOne-hundred percent of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021 shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.\u201d  Just a few weeks ago another article stated \u201cFairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by Dominion Energy.\u201d Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they will be looking to improve on that  number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Peculiar  section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County, VA  in the top left. Could these be potential county contracts they are  working on?](https://preview.redd.it/654d951rsih61.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d86a264c5a413a3f93f0c7cff53de70d08cc7e19)\n\nSpeaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**  received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the  Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state\u2019s  economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company\u2019s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**  in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)  tax credit program based on the company\u2019s planned capital investment in  Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent  start to pave the way for future endeavors.\n\nAnother  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, \u201cRivian\u2019s becoming the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering, ours is $80  million, That\u2019s really just airbags, seat belts and adapting to \\[U.S.  safety requirements\\]. Tooling is already in place because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. \u201cComing off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSupplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.\u201d Well, that's a  bargain.\n\nThe institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:\n\n\u25aaAlpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around  $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so  far.\n\n\u25aaBNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\\~$20million) \u25aaPhoenix Holdings Ltd \u2013 1,103,741 shares (\\~$12million)\n\n\u25aaBank of America \u2013 70k shares (\\~$1mill)\n\n\u25aaToronto Dominion Bank \u2013 15k shares (\\~$203k)\n\n\u25aaSTA Wealth Management \u2013 13k shares (\\~$176k)\n\n\u25aaUBS Group \u2013 Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\\~$200k)\n\nWe also have in the past month:\n\n\u25aaPolar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.\n\n\u25aaP Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.\n\n\u25aaGabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.\n\n\u25aaJefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.\n\nI  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.\n\nAs  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico), Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental or subscription based services.\n\nSome key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :\n\n\u25aaNo additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches\n\n\u25aaProjected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022\n\n\u25aaEstimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \\~5% of U.S. Market\n\n\u25aaRevenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025\n\n# IV. The Indiana Factory\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana.](https://preview.redd.it/ih444ymtsih61.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7220a5c0179175a34a8d4dac49b03d7710507ef)\n\nAnother **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka, Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000 vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive  Director Bill Schalliol says \u201cELMS has worked out a deal with the United  Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in  recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing  staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of  smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if  it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized delivery  vans.\u201d The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.\n\nAnother  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of production \u2013 workers  who are already familiar with the plant and assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.\n\nIn  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically  positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners and  provides access to one of the world\u2019s best automotive talent pools. The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.   \u201cIn addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our engineering \u2013 from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development \u2013 and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use cases,\u201d said  James Taylor.\n\nELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs\u201cELMS plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.\u201d\n\nDid you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV SPAC is at this level? Very few, if any at all.\n\n# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection\n\nOk,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually. Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China. Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.\n\n**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**\n\nThis  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid Motors! (CCIV  GANG IN THE HOUSE!! They are my #2 to my #1 baby here. I'm sorry for  cheating on you FIII!!)\n\nOne thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have seen mentioned  regarding \u201cbad reviews\u201d from employees online about Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla. At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much of a team player.\n\nSeres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**\n\nWell,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars. This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.\n\n# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?\n\nThe  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is the  important question of: \u201cIs this a Chinese company or not?\u201d\n\n**The short and easy answer is NO.**\n\n**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**\n\n**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**\n\nSokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately, ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its customers. \u201cHey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it\u2019s American,\u201d he said. \u201cOur  engineers are here. The software guys. The homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \\[Michigan\\]. We plan to source the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.   \u201cYou\u2019ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut after we\u2019re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we\u2019re like everybody else. I\u2019m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.\u201d  So as we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.\n\n# VII. Technical Analysis\n\nHad  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past 2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above it and  turn it from resistance back into support. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59871x0ysih61.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebd91fcd7da6cbbafcf5a336af79f9e23c0747e7\n\n# VIII. Conclusion\n\nIf  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.\n\nCome, watch this tree grow with me, friend.\n\n[The ELMS tree](https://preview.redd.it/05c5j9o4tih61.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94648f9e4e79c77df21e06307962fc64daed3f09)\n\n^(Positions: 10,000 warrants, 850 commons)\n\n^(Note: Options just came out last week. Will be accumulating March 12.5C and 15C and June 20C)\n\nTLDR:  1st and only Class 1 EV in the US with no competition. Has an amazing  team and management. Has an EV kitted factory ready for production by Q3  of this year in Indiana. Has 30,000 preorders already and expects  30-60k more by next year. NOT a Chinese company, will just be using  Sokon's already successful model and improving on it.",

        "selftext": "I've noticed a lot of new people in here asking some obvious questions to those of us who have been around for a while. So to generate new and better discussion I want to answer some of these frequently asked questions.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1\\. **Where can I find information about these companies**\n\nI hope you haven't bought any of these names before you did research and before you even know where to start looking. First place you should go to is Google and type in \"&lt;company name&gt; investor relations\". If this is too much you can shorten it to \"&lt;ticker&gt; IR\". It should be the first link in every case and if it's not then that's already a red flag.\n\nRead about the companies products, how they operate. Read their MD&amp;A, read their financial statements from the last few years. Maybe look at product reviews or review the products yourselves. Watch interviews with the CEO. Find out what makes this company unique, operationally effective and worth buying for consumers. You should quickly figure out that APHA is NOT a cannabis company, but a consumer packaged good company. They own Cannabis, Alcohol, and Pharma businesses (plus hemp after the TLRY merger).\n\nDoing your DD should take time. Don't be in a rush to buy the stock because it's run up 100% in the past few weeks. If you look at the chart, 2 years ago these companies rocketed upwards to ATHs, you could have waited another year or so and bought lower. Are we taking off to the moon and never coming back? Probably not.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2\\. **Where can I buy these companies? Are they on Robinhood?**\n\nFirst, ditch Robinhood a get a broker that won't go under in the next few years. Pay a trading fee if you need to but just buy enough stock to make the tade worth it. Don't buy $20 of Apha on investorline or you're immediately taking a 50% haircut with a $9.95 trading fee.\n\nSecond, you can buy these companies on most/all legit trading platforms. I won't name them all but all of the big Canadian banks self-directed platforms have them. I'm not American so I can't speak for them but I've heard good things about Fidelity and Vanguard.\n\nOh, did you also mean what exchanges can I buy them on? Big Canadian names are on the major exchanges like TSX and Nasdaq. Smaller names are on the CSE and OTC markets. US names can't list on the big exchanges because your government decided cannabis was bad like 50 yrs ago so those are only on the OTC and CSE markets. MSOs is a fund on the NYSE (I think) that hold some sort of swaps on the US names but I personally just buy the names myself. Again, do you own DD, even if you're buying a fund.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3\\. **This stock went up x% in the last y time, should I buy it or wait for a dip?**\n\nThis ties into point 1 above, so if you've done your DD you should know if the company is worth what it is priced at. The market does wacky shit all the time (see Gamestop, morgage crisis, great depression) so it'll go up and down, but generally follow along the trajectory of the company profits. If the profits increase by 5x in 10 years, the stock price will do the same. If you're asking for predictions in the short term consult a fortune teller, roll dice or find one of those pets that pick stocks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4\\. **What stocks should I buy? How do you feel about x company?**\n\nSee 1, then 3. I can't tell you what companies are good in the space better than your own research. Especially since you don't know what my plans are. Maybe a poster says buy \"Apha\" but they're only holding until the TLRY merger closes. They'll never tell you when they're selling so if it drops you'll be scratching your head. Do a bunch of research on the main players, then some smaller guys and figure out what you can stomach. Maybe a cannabis ETF is right for you or maybe 1 or 2 strong picks or maybe you like gambling with penny stocks. Just do your own DD.\n\nPopular names and good places to start are:\n\n* Canadian names: APHA/TLRY, CGC/WEED, ACB, CRON\n\n* US names: CURA, TRUL, CL, GTII\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n5\\. **Should I buy leaps or warrents or calls or puts? Also what are derivatives?**\n\nIf you have to ask, no. I'm also not going to explain because I don't know either.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n6\\. **I bought Gamestop at all time highs and I sold and lost 90%, is cannabis good?**\n\nNo, kindly take your paper hands and go back to WSB. We don't want investors in this space who sell at the first 10% drop after an 100% run, or after a 50% drop from ATHs, or after a short report from some short selling parasites. We hold because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity of a product moving from the illicit market to the legal market. There is no need to build up demand, merely move the consumer from buying from their dealer to our dealer. This will take time, regulatory changes, perception changes and most importantly, your patience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n7\\. **Any small companies you can reccomend?**\n\nBeing a small company in this space comes with distinct disadvantages. Price compression in Canada will kill small/medium sized growers since they can't achieve postive margins without scale. Add in some mould on even 1 harvest and the losses have destroyed your business. On the US side, regulations are weird and vary across different states. Califonia is a dumpster fire, Florida requires you to be vertically integrated, and other states have limited licences for retail and grows. Think about how hard it would be to get a foothold in Florida as a small business. Think about how valuable a licence is in limited licence states. Maybe your small player is looking for licences and gets NONE. That's devastating. Curaleaf misses 1 licence? Not great, but they have other applications in multiple states.\n\nIf you're buying a small company or penny stock, know the risks and do extra DD. \n\nTHERE HAVE BEEN COMPANIES THAT ARE FRAUDULENT IN THIS INDUSTRY. \n\nCOMPANIES HAVE GONE BANKRUPT IN THIS INDUSTRY. \n\nCanntrust was legit but had fake walls with more plants behind them. Ignite was run by Dan Bilzerian. YOUR PICKS ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM GOING BANKRUPT.\n\nLet me repeat the most important point: THERE HAVE BEEN COMPANIES THAT ARE FRAUDULENT IN THIS SPACE.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n8\\. **I wanna buy because of US legalization! When will Cannabis be legalized in the US?**\n\nAsking for a specific date is dumb and assuming that it's going to pass is dumber. Yes, Democrats control all 3 branches of government and yes, they are more cannabis friendly than Republicans and yes, some Republican states also recently legalized cannabis. THIS DOES NOT MEAN LEGALIZATION WILL PASS THIS YEAR, OR EVEN UNDER THIS CONGRESS OR PRESIDENT. Some Republicans in the house voted for cannabis regulation under Trump and some Democrats voted against it. We have no idea how the senate will vote and it doesn't take many votes to torpedo any legislation. \n\nIf you know the US Cannabis space right now you'll know that descheduling and getting access to lower tax rates, access to capital and ability to cross state lines are some of the most important regulatory changes that need to happen. Look up the ~~208e~~280e tax code. Seriously do it. Full legalization is nice but also unlikely.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf I've missed any questions post them below. and I'll add them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL:DR: Do your own DD. Start here:\n\n* Canadian names: APHA/TLRY, CGC/WEED, ACB, CRON\n\n* US names: CURA, TRUL, CL, GTII\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Adding in some resources for those who want more. These are my own resources I use/used to get started. If you have resources to share please do so but don't self promote you ding dongs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Resources**\n\nNew to Investing:\n\n* Most people think Warren Buffet is the GOAT but [Peter Lynch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Pq5zKEi_g) is also a GOAT in his own right and a better speaker.\n* People also think you need to read through all of \"The Intelligent Investor\" before you can start investing but that's bs. Read \"One up on Wallstreet\" by Peter Lynch. It's like 300 pages shorter and more fun. Then read Intelligent Investor if you want but if you get 20 pages in and fall asleep or feel stupid then I told you so.\n* Martin Shkreli is an asshat but he knows the finance side of valuing companies. [His finance lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI_riscmviI&amp;list=PLJsVF3gZDcuTxcdH5FmQRTd6MiJ29X_OQ) are awesome if you stand him  for a few hours at a time. Follow along with your own companies.\n\nCannabis Resources:\n\n* The sidebar has great resources. ~~Stateside cannabis investors~~(EDIT: Currently down) is awesome for the US side.\n* The OCS releases a [quarterly report](https://ocs.ca/pages/insights-publication) you should read for Canada. Hell, go to OCS.ca and see what products are available and prices. Go to the BC page, the quebec page etc...\n* Statscan has a [cannabis hub](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/13-610-x/cannabis-eng.htm). It's updated super rarely and it might be archived but it's good to look at to start.",

        "selftext": "\"Every day, foreign actors are penetrating our digital infrastructure and conducting a range of cyber intrusions and attacks against the United States. All of these disparate efforts share a common purpose: exploit America's openness to undermine our long-term competitive advantage.\" \n\n\\- Former U.S. Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Daniel R. Coats\n\n# A. Introduction\n\nOkay SPAC-tards,\n\nLet's talk cybersecurity. I know this is a difficult subject with a lot of \"1s\" and \"0s\" and a lot of us have trouble reading (myself included), let alone comprehending what makes the \"magic stonk machine\" work, but this is a serious topic with a lot of tendy potential, so listen up! Set down your moon dust-powered flying electric vehicle stonks, turn off the AI autopilot even though the warning labels say you shouldn't trade without it, put down that fat doobie, and let's take a critical look at SCVX Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: $SCVX) for a moment. ***$******SCVX is the only Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) on the market with a specific focus on cybersecurity. $SCVX will likely select SentinelOne, Netskope, Snyk, KnowBe4, or Vectra as a target in the near-term, offering a 40 percent upside for commons and 100 percent upside for warrants in my uneducated and uninformed assessment.***\n\n*\\*This post is NOT/NOT investment advice and/or a recommendation to purchase $SCVX stock. The views below are based on my own personal research. Please make sure to conduct your own DD before investing. I currently have an active position in $SCVX.\\**\n\n# B. Background\n\nThere is a cyber-attack every 39 seconds in the United States. During the pandemic, malicious cyber intrusions and attacks against the government (federal, state, and local), businesses (small, medium, and large), and individual targets increased by 300 percent according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).^(1) About 64 percent of companies in the United States, 43 percent of which were small businesses, experienced a cyber intrusion during that time period, some of which, inflicted millions of dollars in monetary damage and/or destroyed public confidence in the target company's ability to store and protect customer data.^(2)  \n\n^(\")Dude, 1s and 0s blah blah blah...the pandemic is almost over. We're all going back to the office in a month (assuming any of us even had a job in the first place), so let's get back to moon trucks.\"\n\nNothing wrong with moon trucks, but the fact of the matter is, cybersecurity isn't going away any time soon and we'd be foolish to ignore it. In fact, if it were measured as a country, then cybercrime \u2014 which is predicted to inflict damages totaling $6T in 2021 \u2014 would be the world\u2019s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China. That figure is estimated to climb to $10.5T by 2025 according to CyberCrime Magazine.^(3)  That's a lot of lost tendies. With all that pain, you'd expect the market to get flooded with cybersecurity-focused SPACs, right? Well, that simply hasn't been the case even though the few cybersecurity plays on the market have performed well in the past year. For example...\n\n**1.) Cloudflare Inc. ($NET) +368%**\n\n**2.) Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. ($CRWD) +262%**\n\n**3.) Dynatrace Inc. ($DT) +50%**\n\n**4.) Ping Identity Holding Corp. ($PING) +30%**\n\n**5.) CyberArk Software Ltd. ($CYBR) +27%**\n\n**~~6.) SolarWinds Corp. ($SWI) -11%~~**  *oof, Russia hacked this one!* \n\nAnyway, you get the idea. If you've made it this far, then slam a Redbull, and let's take a critical look at $SCVX as a SPAC and spitball a few ideas for potential targets. Unless you just want to sell on the DA pop and collect those mini tendies for your wife's boyfriend. That's cool and not a bad strategy if you're a beta with paper hands. Because...moon trucks! *Right.* \n\n# C. SPAC Profile &amp; Purpose\n\nSCVX Acquisition Corp. went public on 23 January 2020, so it is currently more than halfway through its two-year time window to identify a validated target.^(4) The SPAC has $230M in the trust although that figure will likely increase to $500M with an additional $300M of PIPE funding in my assessment. (See Figure 1) Mike Doniger, CEO &amp; Chairman of SCVX, said the SPAC was looking to target a company with a $1.5B to $3B valuation, i.e. unicorn, during a recent podcast on CyberWire.^(5) An earlier tweet from Hank Thomas, CTO of SCVX, appears to confirm the SPAC is/was seeking a \"unicorn\" within the sector. (See Figure 2) This valuation target is *significantly* higher than the original $600M to $1.5B valuation Doniger mentioned during the same podcast when the SPAC went public in January 2020.^(5) ***As such, I assess $SCVX will likely not target a company with a valuation less than $1.5B as the SPAC is probably considering options in the $1.5B to $3B range. This valuation will limit the list of potential targets and serve as a key variable in my target selection.***\n\n**Figure 1**\n\n*Processing img jwjh22e85ei61...*\n\n**Figure 2**\n\n[Source: Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/9ni0nws56ei61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebf97dbc34025f58f5410cc4193a411797c676f8)\n\nSo, what does Doniger view as an ideal target? Luckily, Doniger has provided us with valuable insight into the specific criteria the SPAC is looking for within a target company. In Doniger's view, \"fragmentation\" within the cybersecurity industry has become a serious issue. What does that mean exactly? I dunno. lol! Luckily, Doniger broke it down Barney style for us SPAC-tards as he went on to explain that: \n\n\"\\[The industry\\] has grown to look a lot like the vitamins and supplements industry. If you start to take too many, then it is hard to determine which ones are truly beneficial, which ones are counteracting the other, and which ones don\u2019t work at all. Especially as your problems change over time.\u201d ^(6)\n\nAs such, $SCVX is likely seeking to merge with a company that is willing to develop a strategy with the SPAC that integrates other critical security controls into their platform to create something that does not exist in the industry.^(6)  $SCVX was incorporated in the Cayman Islands to provide the SPAC with the flexibility to target a company that is foreign or domestic. \"This is a best athlete scenario,\" Doniger said.^(5) Specifically, Doniger mentioned Israel as a hotbed for cybersecurity companies and said he would likely travel to Tel Aviv to speak with potential targets after the RSA Conference in February 2020. I doubt that happened based on Hanky's Twitter activity though. ***Nonetheless, I assess $SCVX will target a company with a malleable platform that allows the integration of other companies' tools - possibly of Israeli origin. I do not believe, as some have suggested, $SCVX will target several companies at once. Come on guys, I want tendies too, but that makes no sense...lol***\n\n**1.) Management:** I am not going to go into an in-depth analysis of the management team. Doniger is an absolute \"G\", Hanky is kind of a snowflake (thank you for your service tho \ud83d\ude4f), and Jason Bourne's former boss is on the board. Yes, that's right the former U.S. Director of National Intelligence, Daniel R. Coats. If he doesn't know the type of cyber threats that businesses and our country face, then well...we have much bigger problems boyz. That's all the DD I needed to see to analyze the management team. Doniger has the vision and industry experts at his disposal to prosecute the target company in a timely fashion. (Remember: These guys all want their tendies too) Please see below for a list of the management team. I have run in-depth queries on all of their public-facing social media accounts, which yielded nothing of substance. \n\n* **Mike Doniger:** SCVX CEO &amp; Chairman of the Board\n* **Hank Thomas:** SCVX CTO &amp; Board Director\n* **Chris Ahern:** SCVX CFO\n* **Sen. Daniel Coats:** Former Director of National Intelligence &amp; SCVX Board Member\n* **Jeff Lunglhofer:** Chief Information Security Officer at BNY Mellon &amp; SCVX Board Member\n* **Vivian Schneck-Last:** Former Managing Director at Goldman Sachs &amp; SCVX Board Member\n* **Sounil Yu:** Former Chief Security Scientist at Bank of America &amp; SCVX Board Member\n\n**2.) Timeframe to Select Target:** 7 months (4 months without an extension to complete the deal)\n\n**3.) Trust:** $230M \n\n**4.) Additional PIPE:** $300M est.\n\n**5.) Foreign or Domestic:** Both\n\n# D. Potential Target List\n\nThis target list is not mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive, but it is not random either. My methodology for target selection is based on three primary criteria, which are: 1.) platform suitability, 2.) valuation/funding, and 3.) footprint in the fortune 1000. I selected these criteria because Doniger noted he was looking for a company with a malleable platform, $1.5B to $3B valuation, at least Series C funding, and a footprint in the Fortune 1000.^(6) Secondary criteria, which played less of a role in my selection, but I noted were 1.) companies with a presence in Israel and/or of Israeli origin, 2.) companies that attended RSAC 2020, 3.) companies Hanky followed on Twitter. To select these targets, I combed through the RSAC 2020 attendee list containing 78+ companies, public records from the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry, and the rumor mill on the twits, Reddit, Twitter, etc.^(7) ***Based on the above, I assess $SCVX's High Value Targets (HVT) are probably SentinelOne, Netskope, Snyk, KnowBe4 or Vectra. Alternatively, I assess $SCVX may target Vectra as a potential second-tier target.***\n\n**Primary Targets**\n\n**1.) SentinelOne:** meets all the criteria outlined by Doniger and represents a badass target for $SCVX. The company boasts a cyber-security platform with a full-suite of tools across the threat prevention matrix, which serves as a \"one-stop shop\" that can further be tweaked and/or refined. Further, SentinelOne has a $3B valuation and a presence amongst the Fortune 1000. CNBC nominated the company as one of 50 \"disruptors\" in 2020. ***From my optic,*** ***SentinelOne is the perfect target, which may decide to merge with $SCVX. SentinelOne's CEO, Tomer Weingarten, is interested in taking the company public although he commented the company had \"no set timeline for an IPO\" as of 12 November 2020.***^(8 9) \n\n**Selection Criteria**\n\n* **Platform:** SentinelOne Singularity unifies historically separate functions (Prevention, ActiveEDR, IoT, Workloads) into a single agent and platform architecture. \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Valuation:** $3B ^(9) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Funding:** Series F \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Presence w/Fortune 1000:** Yes \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Country:** California, United States \u2714\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \n* **RSAC 2020:** Attended \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Twitter:** Followed by Hanky \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Tendy Rating:** \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n**Figure 3**\n\n[Source: Crunchbase Pro](https://preview.redd.it/5cofbholl9i61.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d054812810a0b1c339f19dde945d7f30b12bffb0)\n\n**2.)  Netskope:** meets all the criteria outlined by Doniger and represents a potential HVT for $SCVX. The company has taken aim at cloud and mobile security as legacy products based on traditional notions of perimeter security have gone obsolete and inhibit the needs of digital businesses. Netskope is focused on security that is fast, delivered from the cloud, and provides real-time protection against network and data threats when cloud services, websites, and private apps are being accessed from anywhere, anytime, on any device.^(10) Netskope has a $3B valuation and a presence amongst the Fortune 1000. ***Netskope is an ideal target, which is eyeing an IPO and may decide to go public via SPAC with $SCVX.

Snyk:** meets all the criteria outlined by Doniger and represents another badass HVT for $SCVX. The company offers security for developers across the cloud-native application stack, which serves as a \"one-stop shop\" for developers that can further be tweaked and/or refined. Further, Snyk has a $2.6B valuation and a presence amongst the Fortune 1000. Interestingly, Snyk also has a corporate office in Tel Aviv, Israel. ***Snyk is an appealing target, which may decide to go public via a reverse merger with $SCVX. Although the company has already raised $200M in Series D funding late last year, CEO Peter McKay is reportedly eyeing an IPO in early 2021, which could take place via SPAC according to the Boston Business Journal.******^(12)***\n\n**Selection Criteria**\n\n* **Platform:** is an open-source security platform designed to help software-driven businesses enhance developer security.^(13) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Valuation:** $2.6B^(12) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Funding:** Series D \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Presence w/Fortune 1000:** Yes \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Country:** Massachusetts, United States w/office location in Israel \u2714\ufe0f\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\n* **RSAC 2020:** Attended \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Twitter:** Not Followed by Hanky **\u274c**\n* **Tendy Rating:** \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n**4.) KnowBe4:** meets all the criteria outlined by Doniger in a less traditional sense since it focuses on the human aspect of cybersecurity - training. Regardless, KnowBe4 represents another HVT for $SCVX based on its integrated training platform, $2.6B valuation, and presence amongst the Fortune 1000, which can be further tweaked and/or refined. ***Given 95 percent of cyber intrusions and attacks are enabled by human error, I can see a compelling case for $SCVX bringing KnowBe4 public via SPAC. The company was allegedly preparing to file for an IPO late last year although no such paperwork has yet to been filed (that's weird) and the possibility the company pivots to go public via SPAC remains.******^(14)***\n\n**Selection Criteria**\n\n* **Platform:** is the world\u2019s largest integrated platform for security awareness training combined with simulated phishing attacks.^(15) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Valuation:** $2B \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Funding:** Series C \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Fortune 1000:** Yes \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Country:** Florida, United States \u2714\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \n* **RSAC 2020:** Attended \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Twitter:** Not Followed by Hanky **\u274c**\n* **Tendy Rating:** \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n**5.) Arctic Wolf:** meets most of the criteria outlined by Doniger as the final contestant in the upper range target category. Regardless, Artic Wolf is an interesting target because the company offers a tailored approach to cybersecurity that is industry-specific.^(16) This customizable platform may be exactly what Doniger is looking to mold into $SCVX's vision of a \"one-stop shop\" cyber security company. Further, Arctic Wolf has a valuation that is just shy of $1.5B at $1.3B and a presence amongst the Fortune 1000. ***While Arctic Wolf is technically the least qualified contestant in the upper range category, $SCVX may target the company since it falls perfectly in the middle of upper and second-tier targets and appears to offer a malleable platform that is highly customizable.***\n\n**Selection Criteria**\n\n* **Platform:** offers a tailored turnkey concierge approach to security operations via managed detection and response, managed risk, and cloud monitoring.^(17) \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Valuation:** $1.3B **\u274c**\n* **Funding:** Series C \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Fortune 1000:** Yes \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Country:** Minnesota, United States \u2714\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \n* **RSAC 2020:** Attended \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Twitter:** Not Followed by Hanky **\u274c**\n* **Tendy Rating:** \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n**Honorable Mention**\n\n**6.)** **Vectra:** meets some of the criteria outlined by Doniger and represents a second-tier target for $SCVX in my assessment. Vectra's platform detects intrusions at the network level, whether in the cloud or on-premises. According to Hitesh Sheth, CEO of Vectra \"Many of our competitors have used open-source technology to build their products, but we have not. We built our own IP and that has given us very unique and powerful scaling capabilities.\"^(18) ***While this competitive edge is unique, Vectra may not fall within the confines of $SCVX's preferred targets since the company's platform appears to be closed and/or unable to add additional tools from external providers. However, I cannot discount the fundamental strength of Vectra as a viable target since $SCVX could shift its position on this issue.*** \n\n* **Platform:** is a closed platform that detects intrusions at the network level in the cloud or on the premises. **\u274c**\n* **Valuation:** $1B+ est. **\u274c**\n* **Funding:** Series E \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Fortune 1000:** Yes \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Country:** California, United States \u2714\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \n* **RSAC 2020:** Attended \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Twitter:** Not Followed by Hanky **\u274c**\n* **Tendy Rating:** \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n**Other Possibilities Considered**\n\n*Exabeam;* *Venafi; Cybereason; Venafi; BioCatch; Venafi; LookingGlass; Socure; Deep Instinct; Extrahop; Cygilant; Cellebrite Mobile Synchronization.*\n\n# E. Conclusion/Timeline\n\nIn the first podcast that aired in January 2020, Doniger predicted the SPAC would announce a target \"sometime in the fall\" after initial talks at RSAC 2020 and/or a trip to Israel. With the onset of COVID-19 last spring, I assess Doniger's travel plans and/or efforts to identify a target within an industry that is not familiar with SPACs may have gotten a bit delayed. (C'mon dude, step up your game! We have flipped like 20 SPACs already) That said, during the most recent podcast on CyberWire, Hanky noted the SPAC was in the \"9th inning\" of selecting a target. ***As such, I suspect $SCVX will make an announcement within the next 30 days for a potential merger at the end of Q2. (Or Hanky owes me a beer w/some tendies because this sh!t took forever to write and you guys are gonna be pissed) Anyway, the time to build a position is now, prior to the DA announcement, not after.*** \n\nThis is the way. \n\n\\- s30ul\n\n**Sources**\n\n1.)

        "selftext": "**My take:**\n\nI've seen a lot of confusion recently about the Aphria/Tilray merger and the share conversion ratio of 0.8381 Tilray share for every 1 Aphria share. \n\nA common narrative I've seen in discussions is investors feeling like they're getting \"Less shares\" or somehow losing money since they'll have a lower number of shares in the end but this is not the case. Remember that Tilray has about 165million outstanding shares and Aphria has 322 million outstanding shares which is almost 2x as much. In short Tilray company + Aphria company are becoming one company (Basically Tilray+Aphria company under the name Tilray)\n\n**Imagine this:**\n\n0,8381[Tilray company] share for every 1[Aphria company] share \n\n**As the following:**\n\n0,8381 share of [Tilray+Aphria company] for every 1 [Aphria company] share.\n\n--------------------------------\n**I've included the full explanation by the CFO of Aphria Carl Merton below (Direct copy paste):**\n\nPart I \u2013 I don\u2019t like the exchange ratio, why wasn\u2019t it flipped?\n\nThis question is effectively rooted in the belief that share price is more important than market cap. And closely rooted to the belief that because an investor had a full share before the transaction but will not have a full share after the transaction, they are somehow disadvantaged (multiple investors have emailed us claiming this is the same as taking shares away from them). I know that share price is much easier to find but it isn\u2019t nearly as relevant as market cap. Market cap establishes the value of the company or how big a pie the company is. Share price is just a function of how many pieces of the pie are available, so how big your piece of the pie is.\n\nIf two companies are worth $5 billion each and otherwise equal but one company has 5 billion shares and the other company has 100 million shares, that means company #1 has a share price of $1 and company #2 has a share price of $50. Just because company #2\u2019s share price is $50, doesn\u2019t mean that company #1\u2019s share price should be $50 as well and could \u201cmoon\u201d to that amount. That would make it worth $250 billion! They are both worth $5 billion.\n\nWhen one company decides to buy another company with its shares, one of the most important negotiating points is how much dilution is there going to be in the new entity. This is determined by how much of the new company, each of the old company\u2019s shareholders receives. This decision gets made based on several factors providing rough fence posts, including the respective market caps, cash provided to the combined entity, sales provided to the combined entity, assets provided to the combined, profits provided to the combined entity, future prospects to the combined entity, etc. Once the fence posts are established, a value in between them can be negotiated. In our case, after thoroughly exhaustive negotiating efforts it was determined that the appropriate split was 62/38. Once this value is known, the legal acquirer (in this case Tilray) is considered to be the fixed variable (their shareholders keep 1 share for each share they own). Given that Tilray had 165.4 million fully diluted outstanding shares at the time of the announcement, this translated to 38% of the combined entity. This math means that Aphria shareholders would get 62% of the fully diluted shares or 269.9 million fully diluted shares (165.4 million / .38 = 435.3 million total fully diluted shares less 165.4 million Tilray diluted shares = 269.9 million fully diluted shares for APHA holders). This figure is then compared to Aphria\u2019s actual outstanding fully diluted shares of 322.0 million and we have to adjust those 322.0 million shares to down to equal 268.9 million (268.9 million / 322.0 million = 0.8381 \u2013 yes, I rounded, and it doesn\u2019t exactly equal, but you should get the point).\n\nSo, what is the takeaway? 62% of the company is the most important variable, but the fact that the number of outstanding shares for Aphria exceeded the number of outstanding shares for Tilray played just as important part in the calculation. If shareholders really want APHA shareholders to get more than 1 share of TLRY, we could always do a share consolidation of 2:1 first. That would double the exchange ratio to 1.6762. It doesn\u2019t change anything though. You are still getting 0.8381 shares for each share you own.\n\nBefore we look at your scenario of a flipped exchange ratio, I feel it is important for investors to understand all the various pieces of information reviewed in considering the appropriate allocation of ownership in the combined entity. There were reviews and analyses of (i) selected publicly-traded companies, including both cannabis and non-cannabis companies; (ii) Aphria\u2019s discounted cash flow analysis; (iii) Tilray\u2019s discounted cash flow analysis (in both cases as prepared by management and as adjusted by the other side); (iv) contribution analyses (sometimes referred to as \u201cfootball field analysis\u201d); (v) implied exchange ratio analyses; (vi) give &amp; get value creation analyses; (vii) current trading metrics; (viii) historical trading price ranges; and, (ix) analyst share price targets. The amount of diligence and work done by both sides was significant.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at your scenario of a flipped exchange ratio and work our way back to the split in ownership.\n\nIn your scenario of 1 APHA share equals 0.8381 TLRY shares, 322.0 million fully diluted shares for APHA would be combined with 138.6 million fully diluted shares for TLRY (165.4 times 0.8381) resulting in 460.6 million fully diluted shares. Which results in APHA shareholders owning 70% and TLRY shareholders owning 30%.\n\nBased on the market caps (what the investing universe believed APHA and TLRY were worth at the time), the split in market caps was roughly 67%/33%. But one of the most important things to remember when comparing market caps, is that by definition the market cap of a company is what investors believe it is worth in total, IF you own a minority interest. If you can own a controlling interest in a company, investors will pay a premium to acquire control. That means that the 33% needs to be increased and the ratio shifted to reflect the premium that the company who is being acquired demands in order to give you control of their company. That is how 33% moved to 38%. But more importantly, it is why you could never get a deal done where the 33% moved down to any number, let alone 30%, if the company was ceding control to the other entity.\n\nIt is also important to understand that in the period leading up to the announcement the 67%/33% ratio was moving up and down, sometimes by a point or two in a given day. Eventually, the two sides needed to pick an allocation then have it stick until the announcement.\n\nPart II \u2013 The Merger was a Bad Idea and My Investment has been Downgraded\n\nOn December 15th, the day before we announced, APHA\u2019s stock price closed at $8.12. On Friday, January 22nd, APHA\u2019s stock price closed at $12.92. That is an ~60% increase in less than 40 days.\n\nPart III \u2013 Why Did Aphria Decide to Do This Merger\n\nWe decided to combine APHA &amp; TLRY because we believe that meaningful synergies are available to shareholders through cost leadership and scale in the Canadian cannabis market. It allows us to offer a full portfolio of brands (including 2.0 products) with a portfolio covering all market segments. In the US, SweetWater and Manitoba Harvest together represent over CAD$120 million in U.S. sales. More importantly, both brands provide leverageable opportunities to introduce our cannabis brands to different consumer markets in advance of federal legalization. In Europe, we will be able to take advantage of a rapidly emerging legal cannabis market through Europe\u2019s largest GMP production footprint while taking advantage of our existing distribution system. Lastly, APHA &amp; TLRY form a company that immediately becomes the international market leader making us more attractive to capital markets due to our scale, cost structure and the strategic opportunity to attract institutional and strategic partners.\n\nIn making this decision, APHA established an investment thesis with which to evaluate potential business opportunities, including: (i) meaningful synergies; (ii) improved strategic positioning for the US; (iii) maximizing opportunities globally; and, (iv) optimal positioning within capital markets. There was also consideration of the risks associated with any transaction, including (i) integration of two major corporations; (ii) likelihood of achievement of the projected synergies; and, (iv) the diversion that a major transaction creates for management. I believe that the TLRY+APHA combination achieves the investment thesis while protecting and minimizing the potential impact of the risks.",

They are also looking to expand into Walmart and global markets which is a very very strong sign imo.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-water-product-online-145400843.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greene-concepts-water-product-online-145400843.html)\n\namazon listing - [https://www.amazon.com/Artesian-Natural-Alkaline-Artisanal-Springs/dp/B08QF9CB9L/ref=sr\\_1\\_6?dchild=1&amp;keywords=be+water+artesian&amp;qid=1611925054&amp;sr=8-6](https://www.amazon.com/Artesian-Natural-Alkaline-Artisanal-Springs/dp/B08QF9CB9L/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&amp;keywords=be+water+artesian&amp;qid=1611925054&amp;sr=8-6)\n\nrestocking amazon inventory - [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-demand-high-greene-concepts-145400877.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-demand-high-greene-concepts-145400877.html)\n\nThere is also very strong buys indicator from different analysts from what I can find online.\n\n[https://otcbb.swingtradebot.com/equities/INKW:OTC](https://otcbb.swingtradebot.com/equities/INKW:OTC)\n\n\\- this is a example, don't want to link every site\n\nAlso in between the lines of one of the news article the CEO states \"  This is just the beginning of many wonderful things to come and I would like to thank Amazon for helping us get this wonderful product to the masses. This is an immensely powerful step in our quest to reach NASDAQ and continual incremental growth as a company\". So my question is not only are they releasing water will they be coming out with new products? And after the performance of the opening day of BeWater, I wonder how strong the new products will be.\n\nI think this stock will get the attention it deserves when earnings report is out because a stock evaluated at 0.015 right now with this strong of a profile is really rare.\n\nMy opinion on the CEO - I also strongly believe in this company because of the CEO. I like how he talks about his vision and his plans months before he does it. He claimed to moving into amazon 3 months ago and as soon as he puts his product on amazon, it sells out in less than a hour. Keep in mind this was the #1 new best seller in mineral water when it came out.\n\nVideo on why you should hold the stock- \n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=ByDuChGGIzM&amp;feature=share",

        "selftext": "**Hello everyone! This isn\u2019t my usual kind of post, but man, I can\u2019t stand to see how people just follow every freaking YouTuber out there blindly!** In this post, we are going to talk about why I believe Tom Nash may be a **fraud**, so please do have some patience and read the full post, as I will go through an in-depth research of his past and his claims.\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nLet\u2019s start by talking about who Tom Nash is &amp; says he is. He is a new &amp; trendy \u201cfinance &amp; stock market\u201d YouTuber which has recently passed 150K subscribers after exploding during this retail investor boom, but here is a short [video](https://imgur.com/yuNMUlv) from his YouTube describing himself.\n\nIn the video he is claiming he is a former \u201csenior financial analyst\u201d which is very hard to believe in my opinion after doing a lot of research about him.\n\nSo let\u2019s go through the **5 reasons** I believe he is lying about his past &amp; why you should never take anything any YouTuber out there says for granted and you should do your own research as well:\n\n**1)  Let\u2019s start with the biggest one, his valuation methods are flawed**\n\nEven though he has posted some videos that have panned out, it\u2019s very hard to differentiate good analysis from pure luck in this recent bull market, even monkeys could throw darts at stocks in the past 11 months and be right after the March sell-off.\n\nI was pretty curious of his valuation methods so I joined his channel membership and asked him a direct question, about his DCF valuation, to which he [responded](https://imgur.com/Zdtm2dI) bluntly that I am doing things wrong. I also sent him a direct link to a well-known financial institute, where we can see that the most common cash flow used for financial [modeling](https://imgur.com/MSJgiSk), which is the unlevered free cash flow, implies that you subtract any capital expenditures of the company, which contradicts the way he sees it and is plain wrong, it\u2019s like he uses 2nd grade math, if you subtract a negative number then your cash flow actually increases, which doesn\u2019t even make sense. How can something that costs you money be a positive on the free cash flow?\n\nI\u2019ll let you digest this as I will next show you some of his DCF valuations &amp; how he uses absurd numbers and changes the formulas as he pleases just to reach some insane valuations for companies just to be catchy.\n\nHere are a couple of short extracts from his Salesforce DCF calculations,\n\n[**Exibit A**](https://streamable.com/vu2agx) \\- everything seems legit until here, now he starts with the biggest mistake in this DCF\n\n[**Exibit B**](https://imgur.com/BWeAZw8) \\- I\u2019ll be blunt you can never, ever add the Capex number to a DCF valuation, that literally throws the hole calculations off, but let\u2019s continue\u2026\n\n[**Exibit C**](https://imgur.com/LgHKupD) \\- So, using a discount rate of 6% is also insane, even with the current low interest rates, you should at least discount the average [SP500](https://imgur.com/YTxt90T) return, or use the WACC or any other type of metric, which is much safer than picking out a single company, as the SP500 has proven over long-stretches to be a great performer.\n\nBut yeah guys, this isn\u2019t the first time he has done these kind of errors, you can see he is using most of these methods in many stock picks which are then spread out to thousands of new investors, who don\u2019t really have the knowledge to test what he is saying. I\u2019m just showing you here a couple of stocks like [Dynatrace](https://imgur.com/hAO37u8), [Opendoor](https://imgur.com/66rMYZe), [Alibaba](https://imgur.com/ikLetLL), [Peloton](https://imgur.com/WRoLdIL), [Salesforce](https://imgur.com/D9Ky3gl) as I showed in the previous video and even [Apple](https://imgur.com/g8k7ZxA) that have been analyzed and spread to the public this way.\n\nThe other big issue with his valuations is that he is using insane long-term growth rates, as he used a 5% growth rate for [Peloton](https://imgur.com/EV2WB9Y) to reach a higher valuation, so can you imagine? If Peloton grows at a 5% rate in perpetuity it means they should more than double the inflation [rate](https://imgur.com/xaN3Dxw) every year and is way higher than any GDP [growth](https://imgur.com/Jkk01c9) the US has seen since 1984.\n\nHe is also [implying](https://imgur.com/Wkd2AV8) that Peloton has no debt on it\u2019s balance sheet, which is 100% false, as you can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/rsB0fJg), he used the cash, cash equivalents &amp; marketable securities to calculate the short term assets while completely ignoring the over $700M in accounts payable no to mention the other current liabilities which would add up to almost exactly the $1.4B in assets he added to his calculations.\n\nBut who knows guys? Maybe he is the real deal, as he has made some [correct](https://imgur.com/v3ZYhSU) DCF implications for some stocks like [Fortinet](https://imgur.com/kCTo7jC) and [FuboTV](https://imgur.com/vojljFt), by actually subtracting the Capex finally, though he doesn\u2019t do this in every analysis, not even in the most recent ones while also keeping that big long-term growth rate at 5%, when I myself never use a bigger one than 4%.\n\nJust for an [example](https://imgur.com/tnWSWVa) I took his CRM numbers and popped them up in my spreadsheets, and even given his methods I couldn\u2019t quite get to the same results without manually editing numbers, as those implications resulted in a 7% undervaluation for the stock, while only adjusting the Capex to be a negative on the cashflows and not touching anything else that might be wrong in this DCF, [resulted](https://imgur.com/5vxgKqI) in a 10% overvaluation for the stock.\n\nSo, I think if he really was a 10+ years wall street analyst I don\u2019t think he could have made these obvious mistakes.\n\n**2) So, Is Tom Nash whom he says he is or is he lying about his past?**\n\n[HERE](https://imgur.com/wbJ8Csh) is the channel intro for his YouTube (Which I can't even see anymore, but i was lucky to download it a couple of days ago)\n\nAs you Can see, I don\u2019t doubt that he actually went to Michigan or that he got and MBA, but I do doubt that all of his Successful \u201cSenior\u201d Financial analyst &amp; consulting Career can be described with only a couple of weak-ass photos of him at an NBA game, or him casually at some kind of a course program as that is exactly what it looks like with the other guys in the back-left of the photo.\n\nAlso, are we to believe all of this great financial career ended with him just taking out his fake plant from his office, while also smiling as he threw away at least a decent salary for a gamble on YouTube, which is very hard to do, especially when you are starting, as YouTube doesn\u2019t really help the small guys.\n\nHis YouTube journey seemed to have [started](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) on the path of exposing guru\u2019s and not financial advice, as he also says in the video, so how did he turn to do financial analysis on YouTube? Seems pretty convenient that he just became an expert in stock analysis as YouTube videos on such things were booming.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/Vq4ov7x), he didn\u2019t make a single stock analysis for the most part of 2020, which seems pretty off, as now most of his videos are on stock analysis, and while his channel was created in 2017, he conveniently deleted all the previous videos, which is another weird move to do.\n\nI also went on a deep internet dive and did a lot of searching about him and I found this video [podcast](https://imgur.com/09mBKRU) of him.\n\nHis main intro in this podcast is that he works as a consultant indeed, from Israel, and also the consultancy job isn\u2019t for a financial company, it\u2019s rather to help people on YouTube grow, so let's look at some extracts from the video:\n\n[**Exibit I**](https://streamable.com/xrbv3o) \\- We can see the main part of the talk is nothing about anything related to his financial past, let\u2019s continue\n\n[**Exibit II**](https://imgur.com/Ziftnpi) \\- It seems he started with a gaming channel, not even a fake guru channel, and I also found something about that FB [GROUP](https://imgur.com/Xdt4H1i) which isn\u2019t active anymore and all of the videos he made for that have also been deleted as you can see in this [post](https://imgur.com/FyKSrIq) from way back in 2018 as he was [teaching](https://imgur.com/T5lbbH2) how to make money on YouTube well through 2019, and was even giving out free workshop [experiences](https://imgur.com/K89Yk3S)  as he was pumping out creator [content](https://imgur.com/z196rMB) which is miles apart from financial analysis (BTW, he is using the same freaking photo in his old banner &amp; logo as his current one, just changing the green screen background), just look at [his](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) old YouTube banner (YouTube tips &amp; tutorials)\n\n[**Exibit III**](https://imgur.com/kZddAl3) \\- Yeah, it seems he also did some video on how to promote on Reddit, and what comes next guys is literally mind blowing, how much more can this dude lie &amp; hide?\n\n[**Exibit IV**](https://streamable.com/ji6ne2) \\-  Well\u2026 Nothing to hide then\u2026 He even had a Fiverr account which was called tomernash you can see clearly [HERE](https://imgur.com/topDW52), that is his username, and when I went out to check it out right now, he is [using](https://imgur.com/HVqNkwv) a fake picture &amp; and still might live in Israel, not the US, and on top of this he might not actually even be from Russia, which he has been saying over &amp; over again on his channel. You can [SEE](https://imgur.com/18Yiimf) he reiterates he is a certified YouTube consultant with no mention of his financial skills or certifications.\n\nAnd even more, you see what picture he uses as a logo yeah? Well, I did a reverse google search and found the other guy also has a YouTube [channel](https://imgur.com/DWpofDb) about kinetic cycling.\n\nMaybe he was one of his clients that he reached a deal to use his picture, wtf, the more I dig in the more I am amazed of the lengths this man has gone to reach fame on YouTube.\n\n[**Exibit V**](https://streamable.com/sdtd7d) \\- So\u2026 A financial analyst with no sheets, no paper, no nothing, great stuff for a senior financial analyst, I literally can\u2019t take more of this so let\u2019s move to the next reasons\n\n**3) Getting in front of the lie?**\n\nI believe that\u2019s what he was trying to do to, by making a [VIDEO](https://imgur.com/CeH7ePh) on this very subject in mid-2020 and popping up higher in the search rankings before his channel boomed.\n\nIn the video he clarifies that Tom Nash isn\u2019t his real name, but he also restated that he was working for a big consultancy firm as recent as this summer, and that he does shit tons of stuff which is very hard to believe, as usually this big consultancy firms have different departments for different things that he mentioned in the video. You can still find that video on his channel if you are interested\n\nBut, by the way, how was he working on that job while also doing hundreds of Fiverr jobs as a YouTube consultant?\n\nHe also claims to not offering any courses, e-books or other stuff like this, which is false as i showed in the previous reasons with his past YouTube courses &amp; other stuff, and as you will see in the next reasons, something smells really bad out here.\n\n**4) Claims about his past**\n\nI also took a deeper dive into more of his past, as you can see in [his](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) previous channel cover and info, he had only about 4K subscribers as he was doing guru video reviews on YouTube, but all of a sudden, he [became](https://imgur.com/r6X2yHg) a senior financial analyst from wall street that was living in Israel &amp; doing Fiverr gigs, I don\u2019t know what to say but it seems pretty fishy to me.\n\nI also checked his LinkedIn [page](https://imgur.com/Xpbq7Im), and all of his skills &amp; endorsements seem to be related to his YouTube skills and nothing about finance or the stock market.\n\nBut I also found his [profile](https://imgur.com/9FxHnCb) on Quora, where he wasn\u2019t that active but still, well back in [2017](https://imgur.com/EUPer8h) he was posting things about gaming &amp; YouTube while supposedly still working on Wall Street as a financial analyst, and it\u2019s interesting that there is no [mention](https://imgur.com/kcpxh2X) of him following anything related to stocks, finance, economy, accounting, statistics or anything other related to the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I guess when you make a new type of video and it boosts your channel from just [10K](https://imgur.com/GEvQ7yB) subscribers all the way up to [150K](https://imgur.com/3F0D4rI) subscribers, you are willing to push the limits and lie about your past just to keep everything going, as YouTube is a really good way to make money right now.\n\n**5) The Transformation**\n\nHe has had even more channels in the past not only this one, which he has transformed overnight from a YouTube Channel [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) to a Guru [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) and finally to a financial [analyst](https://imgur.com/oCIBljZ) , as He created a second &amp; third YouTube account called [GearlyReviews](https://imgur.com/9vAPlu3) where he reviews electronics and [EuroBall](https://imgur.com/G130Wgr) where he only posted 2 videos.\n\nI also searched him through his Reddit [posts](https://imgur.com/zmsRhbB) and only could find things related to marketing &amp; social media, nothing about finance yet again.\n\n# So, my personal opinion which I doubt to be wrong guys, if there is a case of a dubious &amp; fishy person out there, he is one of them.\n\nI believe that he has never worked as a senior financial analyst and especially not a stock market, asset or any other type of equity analyst.\n\nMost of his stock [picks](https://imgur.com/uOgFNkQ) are small-caps that are highly volatile or a couple of recent high flyers which are very catchy to any YouTube audience.\n\nThere are many things wrong about the picture he has painted about himself even though he has gone through a lot to try and erase his past. The fact that there are no mentions of things from the wall street or consulting firm, bad stock analysis and methods, fishy and dubious moves of his YouTube channels and especially fishy things about him being a consultant &amp; analyst in early 2020 while he was already doing YouTube and other stuff back in 2017-2018 really makes me not want to buy his story.\n\nFolks, be careful out there, you can find a lot of YouTubers out there who make more money from their advice giving on YouTube, Patreon or other kind of subscriptions and courses, compared to the actual money they are making or have ever made in the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I don\u2019t want to make a final judgment on this guy, but you should consider everything I have showed about him and all the problems with his past &amp; his financial methods &amp; just remember as always **in a bull market everyone is an expert &amp; genius**, while in a bear market you can\u2019t find any of these people as they all flee.\n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Quick Summary of Plaid/IPOF DD \n\nIPOF is set up in September 2020 and Chamath appoints Dick Costolo former CEO of Twitter to the board. Dick hired Anthony Noto as CFO and later COO at Twitter, the two are good friends. I believe the original intent was to use IPOF to pursue SoFi. In December of 2020 word started to spread that Plaid\u2019s deal with Visa was going to be called off due to regulator concerns. \n\n1/7/2021 Chamath and Noto announce SoFi is merging with IPOE, a much smaller ($700M) Chamath SPAC and we find out Chamath is having to lead the PIPE to close the gap to the almost $9B valuation. This doesn\u2019t make much sense unless something bigger was out there. \n\n1/12/2021 Zachary Perret announces Plaid/Visa acquisition at $5.6B is off. https://twitter.com/zachperret/status/1349158558634565635?s=21\n\n1/12/2021 Chamath tweet the snake \ud83d\udc0d \ud83c\udf37 https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1349136603197755392?s=21\n\n1/15/2021 Perret denies that he\u2019s spoken with any SPACs https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3651874-plaid-ceo-zach-perret-says-hasnt-spoken-to-spacs\n\n1/22/2021 Plaid account tweets \ud83d\udc40 \ud83d\udc40 that more news is coming on 2021 plans. Perret replies \u201cwait, what is this about? Should I no something\u201d and when asked it if it\u2019s a direct listing he says \u201cno\u201d Haven\u2019t seen any news since. https://twitter.com/plaid/status/1352820242926329861?s=21\n\n1/25/2021 Perret tweets that 2021 will be the year of wsb and SPACs https://twitter.com/zachperret/status/1353786395932782593?s=21\n\nThings have been quiet since then with Chamath tweeting \u201ctrenches\u201d and we all thought we knew what that meant. \n\nNow today news leaks that Plaid is looking to raise funds at a $15B valuation but Plaid does not respond and no further details were provided. https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/01/plaid-raising-at-15bn-as-employees-pitched-1200-per-share/\n\nJust was looking at Plaid job postings and noticed this posting for a Senior Financial analysis with the following requirement \n\n- Prior FP&amp;A or Strategic Finance role at high-growth software or platform companies, ideally pre-and post-IPO (https://plaid.com/job/?id=1d6720f3-e8ad-41f3-9eb9-5d63dd02a6b4)\n\nEDIT: Zachary hadn\u2019t tweeted since 1/28 and then just posted a story on Opendoor CEO Eric Wu, Opendoor merged with Chamath\u2019s second SPAC IPOB https://twitter.com/zachperret/status/1359357814762835969?s=21\n\n\nAnd lastly Dick Costolo tweets after a long period of relative silence that picture of the operation rhino drop. Very strange for a guy that rarely tweets. https://twitter.com/dickc/status/1358840215226310660?s=21\n\nAll this adds up in my opinion to a IPOF/Plaid merger at around $15B that could be announced Thursday. \n\nPosition disclosure : 95,000 warrants and 40 2/19 $15 calls, so maybe just wishful thinking but thought I\u2019d share anyway.

        "selftext": "Hi all, I came up with a good way to extract institutional investor transactions using Python from an API in order to analyse if investors are buying or selling stocks in a particular company. \n\nFor example, below table is the outcome showing the transactions performed by institutional investors since the 11th of February on 4 different companies.\n\n\n    total   buys  sells      total_shares_exchanged\n    AAPL  159.0  127.0   32.0           122816727.0\n    MSFT  293.0  251.0   42.0             292622179.0\n    ETSY   42.0   37.0    5.0               3978781.0\n    ATVI  115.0  104.0   11.0               1161650.0\n\n\nWhile the data is useful, I am struggling to make a good use of it. For instance, if I look into MSFT, I can see that 127 institutional funds bough stocks in MSFT and 27 sold stocks. \n\nWhat I would like to do with this analysis is to find stocks that institutional investors are currently buying a lot. \n\nDoes someone know what would be the best approach to do this? I thought about running the script for a bunch of companies and compare them together. But that approach does not make sense because obviously, large market-cap companies will attract more transactions than small-cap companies and they may not be really comparable.\n\nIn case any of you is interested on how to get institutional investor transactions using Python, I have a video showing step by step:\n[Analysing Institutional Investor Transactions!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy_KtPGGTEk)",

        "selftext": "Seeing that a significant interest has developed around VMNT. I have put together an investment DD that puts us where we're standing now. I'll be going over current and past events and why it's severely undervalued.\n\nWhat's up everyone, feel bad about missing the gain train on GME or TSLA? Something much greater is here. The stock VMNT has attracted legions of shareholders who continue to accumulate. VMNT is pink current with virtually no debt, no notes and a low O/S. The Company has seen significant growth.\n\nFirst lets look at the share structure which is one of the most important key information you should look at first before making any investment decision.\n\nAuthorized shares: 500,000,000\n\nOutstanding shares: 65,784,086\n\nFloating shares: 22,670,000\n\nlink [https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/VMNT/security](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/VMNT/security)\n\nSo why is this important?\n\nShare structure is important because it reflects fundamental investment information not explained by stock price alone. Two stocks that have the same price may represent different values. Share structure impacts how a stock\u2019s price acts in relationship to buying and selling activity. It plays an important roll in any stocks... For example, the bigger the share structure the more money (dollar volume) it would take for price to go higher, we call them \"bloated pigs\".\n\nVMNT on the other hand-their share structure is small (Low Float), the sweet spot... not too small (micro float) not too big (bloated pig)\n\nLets put this all into perspective - VMNT can do several hundred percent and hold gains with just minimal volume.\n\nNow lets get to some of the exciting stuff.\n\nInterest started to build when the CEO secured $30,000,000 for its peer-to-peer (p2p) fintech company Fvndit/eloan.vn from 2 institutional investors.\n\nRead more about it here: [http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/08/2090187/0/en/Fvndit-Closes-30M-In-Financing-For-eLoan-And-Seeks-To-Advance-Its-Market-Leading-Position-In-Vietnam.html](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/08/2090187/0/en/Fvndit-Closes-30M-In-Financing-For-eLoan-And-Seeks-To-Advance-Its-Market-Leading-Position-In-Vietnam.html)\n\nThis not only caught interest for retail investors but also caught interest in the fintech industry as a whole.

        "selftext": "**So you want to get into Psychedelics - The Three Axes of Psychedelic Investing**\n\nHi everyone! I\u2019ve been looking through posts here since the beginning of the community and unfortunately there seems to be more misunderstanding than ever regarding company selection and the future of psychedelics. If you have asked one of the following (or some variation) in the recent past: \u201cNUMI or MMED?\u201d, \u201cCMPS or MMED?\u201d, \u201cTRIP or FTRP?\u201d, \u201cCMPS or CYBN?\u201d then I think this post is for you. \n\nThe psychedelic sector is complicated. It isn\u2019t as simple as picking a company assuming they all do the same thing and hoping for the best. You need to tailor your interest as an investor to what I have come to call the \u2018**Three Axes of Psychedelic Investing\u00ae**\u2019. I am hoping that with this post I will help to clear up a lot of the confusion surrounding the sector. \n\nUnderstanding the tiny nuances of each company is not critical to forming at least a base level of opinions regarding which one you want to focus on. As an investor, you must have some idea as to why you think the sector will be profitable in the future (on top of being beneficial for mental health). Why are you here? What do you like about the industry? If you only have a vague idea, then I hope that you can narrow down your selection with this guide. I want to make clear that the examples I use are not meant to be plugs for any specific company, they are simply companies representative of the area I am presenting. Generally, I am using the more well-known companies to facilitate understanding.\n\n**Axis X \u2013 Sector Segment**\n\nIt should come as no surprise that there are many fields available to invest in in terms of psychedelics. In much the same way as cannabis, investors can choose from a variety of focuses. Maybe you are interested in medical use. Maybe you like the idea of recreational use. Or maybe you\u2019d like to pull a quote from Mark Twain, \u201cduring the gold rush it\u2019s a good time to be in the pick and shovel business\u201d and invest in companies that are manufacturing the drugs. Although the end goal of these varying companies share a commonality in psychedelic harm reduction/decriminalization/legalization, they are attempting to get there in hugely different ways. The way I see it there are 4 key diverse segments that exist, which, for the most part, **do not compete with one another for business**:\n\n*i) Research and Development (ATAI, CMPS, CYBN, ENBI, MMED, MYCO, RVV \u2013 NUMI has also entered this space but until recently this was not their focus)*\n\nThese companies have a singular goal in mind: to put in the leg work and money to run clinical trials to develop a pharmaceutical product. These are the **shapers** of the sector. Companies in this field are generally focused on bringing a drug to market through approval of the FDA. This is a time and capital-intensive process as drugs need to progress through a phased study process which can often take years of development, sometimes longer if things do not go well. A proprietary product, while a nice bonus in terms of marketing and patentability (more on this later), is not a requirement of this field. In fact, many companies are going through the clinical trial process for the greater good, not for the corporate greed associated with drug sales. At the end of the day, think \u201cwalk into a clinic or pharmacy and get a prescription written/filled\u201d as the focus of this segment. If you have an interest in pharmaceutical production/marketing with psychedelics or psychedelic derivatives in mind, consider using this segment for your \u2018X-axis\u2019.\n\n*ii) Clinical Use (FTRP, SHRM, NUMI)*\n\nThese companies are focused on actually applying psychedelic compounds in a clinical setting (i.e. you walk into a clinic and receive psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy). These are the **implementors** of the sector. When you think of psychedelic therapy, this is what you envision in your head. Alongside trained healthcare professionals, patients can be given psychedelics with the goal of improving mental health status or treating underlying trauma. This is really a grey zone of the medical field at the moment. Is it legal to give these drugs to people when they are on lists which prohibit their possession, sale, and consumption? Hard to tell. This is where ethics really start to outweigh outright legislation. There is a growing movement for compassionate use (see TheraPsil if you want to know more) and some ground is being gained in that regard. If you have an interest in practical use of psychedelics and want to invest in companies actually doing what the shapers are proving in their trials, consider using this segment for your \u2018X-axis\u2019.\n\n***It should be noted that in i) and ii) that simply being in the same segment, perhaps even using the same compound (more on this later), does not imply direct competition. For instance, company \u2018a\u2019 could be studying/applying psilocybin for use in depression while company \u2018b\u2019 also studies/applies psilocybin but for use in PTSD.*** \n\n*iii) Industrial Production (HAVN, MYCO, NUMI)*\n\nThese companies are really the ones behind it all. Without somebody actually producing the products being tested or applied, there couldn\u2019t really be any sector at all. And no, I don\u2019t mean that guy down the block who grows his own mushrooms or the dark web LSD supplier you get to ship to some PO box in the next town over. While valid that these are likely what they say on the label, there are rigorous *Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)* which products must be manufactured under to meet the government\u2019s standard of applicability. These are the **suppliers** of the sector. There is a direct and obvious need for other companies to get their psychedelics from a GMP-licensed facility. Often, companies in different segments are co-dependent on each other to meet some unfulfilled, critical need (i.e. application cannot occur without research, research cannot occur without a product). If you have an interest in investing in the most fundamental portion of the sector, consider using this segment for your \u2018X-axis\u2019.\n\n*iv) Recreational Use and Consumer Products (HAVN, SHRM, NEON, TRIP)*\n\nThe ultimate goal of many companies in the sector is to achieve some level of de-stigmatization, public acceptance, or altered legislation. While noble in cause, not every company is wanting to capitalize on shifted public perception and psychedelic legal status. These are the **campaigners** of the sector. Using published research and fighting the good fight at the ballot box, companies in this segment seek to market products and shift perspectives. These companies believe in a future (whether on the horizon or much further on) much the same as the present-day cannabis craze. These companies are likely involved in harm-reduction practices and public education to demonstrate the benefits of recreational use. This could be in the form of microdosing, experiential dosing, or even just to have a unique experience. In North America these companies are likely to have quite an uphill battle to go for the foreseeable future whereas in Europe they are already seeing uptake. If you want the average person to be able to access and use psychedelics free from the most intense legal restrictions, consider using this segment as your \u2018X-axis\u2019.\n\nSo now you have some idea of the broad goals of each segment. Maybe now the reason asking \u201cNUMI or MMED?\u201d seems illogical is a little clearer. They are two companies focused, for the most part, on two isolated market segments. But I can understand if you want to ask at a deeper level \u2013 after all I did just write that both NUMI and MMED are involved (at some level) in the research and development sector. This is a good segue into the next portion of this guide which outlines compound selection. For the most part, the same general rule applies to all four segments so I won\u2019t take the time to write out an explanation in each category (however I will characterize some companies in each space).\n\n**Axis Y \u2013 Compound Selection**\n\nThere are a wide variety of compounds being investigated for the treatment of various psychiatric and physical conditions. Understanding that companies have unique focuses can help guide your selection to one that interests you. It is not a fair comparison to look at MMED and CMPS, for instance, and assume that they are in direct competition. While yes it may be true that the treatment goal in some instances is the same (i.e. treatment resistant depression), their path to treatment is dramatically different. At this point, in the absence of proven data (not anecdotal), it\u2019s a toss up on what will work and whether any one medication will prevail. For example, it\u2019s similar to comparing the various antidepressants (SSRIs for demonstration). In reality, they are essentially interchangeable. There is very little clinical difference between citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, or paroxetine in terms of efficacy. From a side effect perspective, they have differences but none so large that any one of these medications doesn\u2019t see individual use. Taking into account your selection in \u2018Axis-X\u2019, **you can really choose a company based in the drug that interests you the most** to fit your \u2018Axis-Y\u2019**:**\n\n*i) Psilocybin/derivatives \u2013 CMPS, CYBN, MYCO, NUMI, RVV, SHRM, TRIP*\n\n*ii) LSD/derivatives \u2013 CaamTech (private), MAPS (non-profit) MMED*\n\n*iii) MDMA/derivatives \u2013 ATAI (private), MAPS (non-profit), MMED, NUMI*\n\n*iv) Ketamine/derivatives \u2013 ATAI (private), FTRP, NUMI, SHRM*\n\n*v) DMT \u2013 AGN, ATAI, (private), ENBI*\n\n*vi) Ibogaine/derivatives \u2013 ATAI (private), MAPS (non-profit), MMED, Universal Ibogaine (private)*\n\nI think it also warrants mentioning a point I see brought up often: \u2018compound x cannot be patented as it is a natural product\u2019. This is true, but you need to think outside the box a little more. There is nothing stopping a company from patenting a particular nuance of the compound. For instance, if I found out that DMT was effective in treating nicotine use disorder but wanted to patent a product what could I do? As DMT is a natural chemical released by your brain there is no way it can be patented. But ah-ha, if I were to devise a delivery system for the DMT (like a transdermal patch for instance) then I would have a fully proprietary product which piggybacks off the research I have just completed. All I need to do is show that my transdermal patch is pharmacokinetically equivalent to the administration method I completed in my study! There are many instances where a product can become proprietary. In fact, a similar process called \u2018evergreening\u2019 is done by big pharmaceutical companies all the time. Like using drug x? Well we put drug x into a new extended release capsule. Boom. 10+ years of extra patenting. All you need to do as a company is market the hell out of it and convince the public it is new and better when you did very little to change your initial product. \n\nSo now you have chosen a sector segment and you\u2019ve identified a compound that interests you. What\u2019s left to do? As I alluded to before, it isn\u2019t as simple as choosing a drug and assuming direct competition among its providers/researchers. To be clear, it is likely the case that recreational and industrial production companies *are* in direct competition as they are simply providing a substance, what is done with it afterwards is not their business. Therefore, these two segments have been excluded from our last section. Not every compound is created equal, nor is every unique psychiatric condition.\n\n**Axis Z \u2013 Condition Selection**\n\nEvery day there seems to be some new application for psychedelics as therapeutic tools. Whether there is merit to most of these claims will remain to be seen. Over time more robust data will come out and there will be demonstrable proof of benefit or lack thereof in a multitude of conditions. At the moment there are a few \u2018popular\u2019 conditions which are being examined. Of course with each condition there is only a handful of investigators. Use this selection in combination with your choices for \u2018Axis-X\u2019 and \u2018Axis-Y\u2019 to guide your \u2018Axis-Z\u2019:\n\n*i) Treatment-Resistant Depression \u2013 ATAI (private), CMPS, CYBN*\n\n*ii) Major Depressive Disorder \u2013 ATAI (private)*\n\n*iii) Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \u2013 MAPS (non-profit) + NUMI, MYCO*\n\n*iv) Substance Use Disorders \u2013 ATAI (private), ENBI, MMED, NUMI*\n\n*v) Anxiety \u2013 MMED*\n\n*vi) ADHD \u2013 MMED* \n\nImportantly, in most of these cases, the drug of interest is almost never used alone.

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ZINC8\n\n*OTCMKTS: MGXRFCNSX: ZAIR Market Cap57.845M*\n\n**DD:**\n\n**TLDR** = Buildings need to lower emissions by law, Zinc8 is currently the only legal solution in NYC building code. New York Power Authority (NYPA) selected them out of many options and is supporting them, 58,000 buildings need to upgrade by 2024. Lithium Can't be used in buildings because of safety concerns, Zinc8 Provides an alternative at a lower cost compared to lithium.  They already proved their technology and are starting to gain international attention. This company is only $58M Market Cap which pales in comparison to its peer EOS at $1.3B.\n\n\"We're already getting calls since Friday afternoon, like the list is full, utilities, big interconnect companies, mostly in the US but also in Europe\" - CEO Ron Macdonald after winning the NYPA contract.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# More also very important details:\n\nZinc8 is up next in the wave of investment coming to green technology, this is a complimentary solution to lithium ion-based batteries. Typically, where portability is not an issue, i.e buildings, grid storage etc. Also where safety is a concern, this is in part why Zinc8 was selected by the NYPA (New York Power Authority) to build the first 100kw/1MWh zinc-air ESS  in New York State.  What makes this more impressive is that they competed among many different companies and were selected out of all the options.\n\nTo FURTHER add to this, they won the New York City Department of Buildings Innovation Challenge in NYC. NYC DOB regulates the lawful use of over 1.2 million buildings and constructions sites. Zinc8 technology will be included in the 2020 NYC Building code. According to Governor Cuomo 50,000 buildings will be required to reduce their carbon footprint under local law 97, as part of a broader initiative to bring down carbon emissions. ***This means they are the only solution currently approved in the building code, lithium is not because of safety concerns.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"To reduce carbon emissions from buildings, the City of New York enacted Local Law 97 (LL97) in 2019 as a part of the Climate Mobilization Act. This leading-edge law places carbon caps on most buildings larger than 25,000 square feet\u2014roughly 50,000 residential and commercial properties across NYC. These caps start in 2024 and will become more stringent over time, eventually reducing emissions 80 percent by 2050.  \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey won another contest by the  Rocky Mountain Institute ([https://third-derivative.org/](https://third-derivative.org/)), but another notable event is recently they delivered a functional 20-80KW unit to a high-end home in British Columbia, Canada. 20-80 is a feature of their scalability, you can easily upgrade your unique to 80KW by adding an extra stack.\n\n([https://www.zinc8energy.com/investors/press-releases/2020/59-zinc8-energy-solutions-announces-update-to-commercialization-milestone-agreement-for-75-house-in-surrey-british-columbia](https://www.zinc8energy.com/investors/press-releases/2020/59-zinc8-energy-solutions-announces-update-to-commercialization-milestone-agreement-for-75-house-in-surrey-british-columbia))\\*Press release - announcing an update to the project, CEO confirmed delivery in last conference call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese guys are the real deal and look like a legitimate contender in this space, with a lot of potential. The CEO said after winning that NYC building development contest their phone was ringing off the hook because these buildings want their technology as a solution! They must meet local law.I highly recommend you listen in on this call, especially from 2:30 to 6:00.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHW5vjIdjGw&amp;ab\\_channel=ZimtuCapital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHW5vjIdjGw&amp;ab_channel=ZimtuCapital)\n\n\\^\\^ AGM Conference Call :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"*That market is 1.2 million buildings so they had a decarbonation challenge, there was a huge board that selected who the winners were, there were four winners and over on the storage side and the battery side we were picked as the winner. We became the winner and what does that mean? it means that the city of New York is going to* ***support us and be included in their building code so we are the number one company in the world that operates in New York that can participate in this marketplace.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*... so I mentioned what the marketplace was*  ***58 000 buildings*** *our solution going in even if there's even if there's no rooftop solar or other renewables we can load shift buy the power at night in our battery at five cents and reduce the company any company that's our partner reduce their their dependence the next day on 30 cent power the power that's produced at night that spot at night has a lower carbon footprint so we think that this is probably the biggest market that opened up that we didn't expect because when we made the application we thought well maybe we've got a chance, but we won\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- CEO  Ron MacDonald\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI strongly believe this entire company has flown under the radar and we have a real GEM on our hands here. They\u2019re CHEAPER than lithium and the technology works.\n\nComparable is  NASDAQ: EOSE - EOS Energy Solutions - They're also producing Zinc-Air Batteries, their market cap is about $1.2B, a bit further along in the process but still a very close comparable and possibly an opportunity for early investors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut please do your own DD, this is not\u00a0advice.\n\nI own shares and plan to buy more.",

        "selftext": "Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \\~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.\n\nI now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this?  When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers.  For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well.   The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.  \n\nNow, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit.  When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of  payment for your transaction.  The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal? \n\nBasically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above,  Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments.  To quote,  PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there.  PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What\u2019s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading. \n\nBasically, it\u2019s doing it all.  PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues.  It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.\n\nIf you are looking to place a blue-chip stock in your portfolio, I believe Paypal will the next best bet.",

Respectively, that\u2019s a share\nprice increase of 77% and 225%. A critical note is that these ratings are quite recent, not historic. For example, Mizuho upgraded Selecta Biosciences as recently as [last week](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-selb-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-01/), while HC Wainwright issued a buy rating on January 7th, and Canaccord Genuity set a $13.00 [price target](https://www.analystratings.com/articles/canaccord-genuity-sticks-to-its-buy-rating-for-selecta-biosciences-selb/) also on January 7th. \n\n &gt; The stock currently trades at a 21% discount from its 52 week high of $4.83.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**COMPANY OVERVIEW**\n\nSelecta Biosciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company, headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts, and led by President and CEO, Dr. Carsten Brunn, who previously served as the President of Pharmaceuticals at Bayer (American Region). Selecta Biosciences was founded in 2008, and initiated their public offering on June 22nd, 2016. Their flagship product is the clinically-validated ImmTOR platform, a system for developing antigen-specific tolerogenic therapies. They have acquireed partnerships with multiple major pharmaceutical\ncompanies, including [Sobi](https://www.sobi.com/), [Serepta Therapeutics](https://www.sarepta.com/), and [AskBio](https://www.askbio.com/), and they have recently received a consensus analyst buy rating, with an upper end price target of $13, representing a 225% increase from the current share price. The science behind Selecta, and their ImmTOR technology, is largely based on a 1994 [research paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8128245/) published in the journal *Science*. In 2006, [Dr. Omid Farokhzad](https://farokhzad.bwh.harvard.edu/wp/members/principal-investigator/), a professor at Harvard Medical school and the director of [The Center for Nanomedicine at BWH](https://nanomedicine.bwh.harvard.edu/), along with prolific MIT inventor, [Dr. Robert Langer](https://www.statnews.com/2016/05/31/robert-langer-biotech-new-york-city/), published a [highly cited paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17070960/) showing how to use synthesized nanoparticles to deliver drugs to cancer cells. In 2008, they founded Selecta Biosciences with Harvard immunologist Ulrich von Andrian.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE COMPANY MANAGEMENT LOOK LIKE?**\n\nIf you have followed some of my previous posts and comments, you will know that I consider management to be the most important factor. Regardless of the product, industry, or finances, it is the people running the company that will determine its success. In my opinion, among every biotechnology company that I have evaluated, Selecta Biosciences has the strongest management team.\n\nSelecta Biosciences is led by President and CEO, Dr. Carsten Brunn, who holds a Ph.D\nin chemistry, from the University of Hamburg. Prior to his work at Selecta, Dr. Brunn was\nthe president of Pharmaceuticals for the Americas Region at Bayer. He served as chairman\nof the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations Japan, and he held senior leadership positions at Eli Lilly, Novartis, Basilea, and Bausch &amp; Lomb.\n\nSelecta\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer is Dr. Takashi Keisters Kishimoto, who holds a Ph.D in immunology\nfrom Harvard University. Dr. Kishimoto was previously the Vice President of Discovery\nResearch at Momenta Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company that was purchased\nBy Johnson &amp; Johnson in October of 2020, for $6.5 billion. Over the course of his career, \nDr. Kishimoto has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles in major scientific journals, \nIncluding Nature, Science, and The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAmong their all-star Board of Directors is [Dr. Goran A. Ando](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gran-ando), a 37 year veteran in the\npharmaceutical industry. Dr. Ando is the former Chairman of the Board of Novo Nordisk, one \nof the world\u2019s leading pharmaceutical companies. Prior to that, Dr. Ando held executive\npositions at Pfizer and Bristol-Myers. \n\nFor a full list of leadership, please use [this link](https://selectabio.com/about-us/).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS THE ImmTOR PLATFORM?**\n\nLet\u2019s start with an introduction to the problem. Immunogenicity is the ability of a substance to stimulate an antigen-specific immune response. Antigens include a wide array of substances produced by cells,\nbacteria, fungi, or other organisms, but they are typically proteins. Unfortunately, immunogenicity can cause unwanted immune responses, such as the formation\nof anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), which can alter the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of different drugs, or the induction of hypersensitivity reactions, which have life-threatening\nconsequences. ImmTOR is coadministered with biologic therapies, and it is shown to restore natural tolerance and enable patients to remain on therapies longer.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**HOW DOES THE ImmTOR PLATFORM WORK?**\n\nFrom Selecta Biosciences,\n\n&gt; ImmTOR is designed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance by targeting rapamycin to immune cells using nanoparticle technology, which has been clinically proven as an effective delivery system. When administered to a patient, ImmTOR nanoparticles are filtered out by lymph nodes, spleen and liver, where they are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), a type of APC which can trigger immunogenic as well as tolerogenic responses from T cells. ImmTOR promotes the induction of tolerogenic DC which go on to activate antigen-specific regulatory T cells to suppress the immune response to the antigen.\n\nFor a more in-depth look at ImmTOR, please refer to [this article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00969/full#:~:text=general%20immune%20suppression%20is%20supported,to%20subsequent%20challenge%20with%20antigen), which discusses\nThe development of ImmTOR Tolerogenic Nanoparticles.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THEIR PIPELINE LOOK LIKE?**\n\nFor a portfolio overview, please use [this link](https://selectabio.com/portfolio/)\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHERE CAN I FIND PEER-REVIEWED RESEARCH?**\n\nYou can find a selection of peer-reviewed research [here](https://selectabio.com/resources/).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT PARTNERSHIPS HAS SELECTA SECURED?**\n\nSelecta has several research and commercial rights partnerships with global pharmaceutical companies. These \ninclude [Sobi](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/11/2047185/0/en/Sobi-and-Selecta-announce-strategic-licensing-agreement-for-SEL-212-a-phase-3-ready-novel-treatment-for-Chronic-Refractory-Gout.html), for strategic licensing of SEL-212, [AskBio](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/12/19/1962801/0/en/AskBio-Licenses-Rights-to-Selecta-Biosciences-ImmTOR-Immune-Tolerance-Platform-for-the-Treatment-of-Pompe-Disease.html) for the use of ImmTOR in the treatment\nof Pompe Disease, and [Serepta Therapeutics](https://investorrelations.sarepta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarepta-therapeutics-and-selecta-biosciences-enter-research)\nfor the use of ImmTOR for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS THE VALUE PROPOSITION?**\n\nThis is likely one of the easiest questions to answer. A large amount of drugs provoke unwanted immune responses, which reduce a drug\u2019s efficacy\nand exacerbate adverse effects. The ImmTOR platform creates drug-specific immune tolerance, enhancing the effectiveness of drugs, as well\nas its safety profile. This means the ImmTOR platform can be used in cooperation with a substantial amount of other drugs. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT IS SELECTA BIOSCIENCES FINANCIAL SITUATION?**\n\n\n*Recent Financing:* \n\nOn June 11th of 2020, Selecta entered into a [strategic licensing agreement](https://www.sobi.com/en/press-releases/sobi-and-selecta-announce-strategic-licensing-agreement-sel-212-phase-3-ready-novel)\nwith [Sobi](https://www.sobi.com/en/about), and international biopharmaceutical company worth $48 billion. \nThe agreement is for SEL-212, Selecta\u2019s phase-3-ready therapy powered\nby ImmTOR, their immune tolerance platform. Included in the deal is an initial\npayment of $100 million, commercial and milestone payments of up to\n$630 million, tiered double-digit royalties on net sales, and equity purchases at $4.62/share.\nThis means you can currently purchase shares at a discount to what Sobi paid. \n\n\nOn September 1st of 2020, Selecta Biosciences secured up to [$35 million in debt financing](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/01/2086854/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-Secures-Up-To-35-Million-Debt-Financing-with-Oxford-Finance-LLC-and-Silicon-Valley-Bank.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20terms%20of%20the,achievement%20of%20two%20development%20milestones%3A), available in two tranches, \nwith $25 million issued at closing, and an additional $10 million available through September 30th of 2021. Part of these proceeds will be used to retire $12.6 million\nin existing debt.\n\n*Cash Position:* \n\nSelecta had $147.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2020, which compares to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $91.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Selecta believes its available cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2020 will enable Selecta to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2023.\n\n*Revenue:* \n\nRevenue recognition for the third quarter 2020 was $4.6 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized $4.3 million under the license agreement with Sobi resulting from the shipment of clinical supply and the reimbursement of costs incurred for the Phase 3 DISSOLVE clinical program and $0.3 million for shipments under the collaboration agreement with Sarepta. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, Selecta did not recognize revenue.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT KEY MILESTONES HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ACHIEVED?**\n\n* **1.** In September, Selecta commenced the Phase 3 clinical program, known as [DISSOLVE](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/23/2097859/0/en/First-Patient-Randomized-in-the-Phase-3-DISSOLVE-Clinical-Program-of-SEL-212-for-Chronic-Refractory-Gout.html) for the clinical evaluation of SEL-212, which is the foundation\nfor Selecta\u2019s pipeline of tolerogenic therapies. \n\n* **2.** In October, the FDA granted Selecta the [Rare Pediatric Disease Designation](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/20/2111023/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-and-AskBio-Receive-FDA-Rare-Pediatric-Disease-Designation-for-their-Gene-Therapy-for-Methylmalonic-Acidemia.html) for MMA-101, used in the treatment of\nIsolated methylmalonic academia. This designation highlights the significant unmet medial need that Selecta is seeking to address. Phase 1 clinical trials\nare expected to begin in the first half of 2021, with data expected before the end of the year. \n\n* **3.** Also in October, Selecta and IGAN Biosciences entered into a [research license and option agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/08/2105919/0/en/Selecta-Biosciences-and-IGAN-Biosciences-Enter-into-Research-License-and-Option-Agreement-to-Study-Selecta-s-ImmTOR-Immune-Tolerance-Platform-in-Combination-with-IGAN-s-IgA-Proteas.html)\nwhich provides Selecta with the option to exclusive licensure for the rights to develop and commercialize the ImmTOR platform in\ncombination with IGAN\u2019s [IgA protease](https://www.iganbio.com/iga-protease-for-igan/), which is used to treat [IgA Nephropathy](https://igan.org/)\n\n* **4.** On January 6th, Selecta announced pre-clinical data in non-human primates\nthat validated the ImmTOR platform\u2019s ability to enhance the efficacy, safety and durability of \nadeno-associated viral vector gene therapies. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE INSIDER ACTIVITY LOOK LIKE**\n\nInsider activity is an excellent way to assess the confidence of the company executives. I\u2019m sure most of you are familiar with the phrase, \u201cput your money\nwhere your mouth is\u201d. I prefer to speculate on companies where the executives have a large incentive for success.\n\nOver the last twelve months, we\u2019ve seen a staggering 9,351,485 [shares purchased by insiders](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/selb/insider-activity), compared against 13,314 that were sold.\nOn January 4th of 2021, we saw 262,000 non-open market shares acquired by company officers, and in October, Timothy Springer [purchased a whopping](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/timothy-springer-just-bought-25-142015780.html)\n$5.4 million worth of stock.\n\nIn addition to this, Selecta has an astounding institutional ownership of 64.41%, compiled from 98 different institutional holders.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHAT DOES THE OPTION CHAIN LOOK LIKE?**\n\nSelecta has options available with three strike prices and expirations on March 19th, June 18th, and September 17th. The March 19th $5 call options have recently seen a volume spike, and had\nan open interest of 2564 as of Friday, January 29th. These are the highest volume of all available options. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**WHY AM I PURCHASING THE STOCK NOW?**\n\nIn my opinion, all clinical-stage biotechnology companies present three obvious challenges. Will their product work, do they have enough capital to reach commercialization, and have they partnered with any major company that can accelerate their product or service? Prior to discovering these answers, biotechs are highly speculative. After years of development, I believe that Selecta has reached all three milestones. In light of these milestones, as well as analyst endorsements, FDA approvals, institutional and insider purchasing, option volume and volatility, and growing sentiment, I think Selecta is poised for significant growth. Beyond this, I find tremendous value in a company that has licensing deals worth more than the companies entire market capitilization. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**TL:DR;**\n\nSelecta Biosciences is a Watertown, Massachusetts based biotechnology company. They are engaged in the \nresearch and development of nanoparticle immunomodulatory drugs that work in conjunction with existing\nbiologics, for the treatment and prevention of numerous human diseases. Their flagship product\nis the ImmTOR Tolerogenic Nanoparticle Platform, a technology used to mitigate anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)\nin response to life-sustaining drugs. Their lead pharmaceutical candidate is SEL-212, a Phase 3 enzymatic \ntherapy for the treatment of gout, one of the most common forms of arthritis. The company is managed by\na cast of successful executives, many of whom previously held leadership roles at Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, Bayer,\nand other global pharmaceutical companies. They are financed through 2023, and have recently received\na consensus buy rating from major analysts, with a price target range of $7-$13. The stock is majority held by \ninstitutional investors, and insiders have made large volume share acquisitions over the past several months. \nTheir partnership with Sobi, an international pharmaceutical juggernaut, is worth $100 million in\ninitial payments, and over $630 million in commercial and milestone payments. This deal alone\nis worth more than Selecta\u2019s entire market capitalization. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**POSITIONS**\n\n4,000 shares at $4.28, but I plan to increase my position this week.",

        "selftext": "This will probably be my last post on $KROEF (KR1 for the UK) as I don't think this will stay under the radar for long. For now, this stock is still massively undervalued and still a potential 3x multibagger - potentially more over the long term but that would be pure speculation. \n\nFor a longer overview of what $KROEF is, please see my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lgq88i/kr1_plc_will_now_be_available_to_american/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lfoj52/sharing_my_next_best_stock_pick_of_2021/). \n\n**TLDR on KR1:**\n\n1. KR1 - Basically an actively managed ETF picking the best Decentralised Finance (Defi) and blockchain projects. For instance, you could have purchase Polkadot (DOT) - up 999.13% for the year - or you could have picked SXPDOWN - down 99.65% for the month via Binance or Coinbase. **Advantages:** You get direct exposure. **Disadvantages:** you more likely to lose money (unless you spend a lot of time reading up on all the coins &amp; have a knack for picking winners), you don't get the tax benefits. To put things into perspective, there are 216 DeFi projects and a staggering 5,098 altcoins. Picking the winners from the losers is very hard, akin to picking winning stocks in the stock market. KR1 has consistently managed to pick winners since 2016, so they know what they are doing. They now have a strong portfolio of digital assets. \n2. KR1 is incredibly undervalued from its NAV. The team at KR1 is very small and they have been working tirelessly to try and grow the business - evident by the fact they have been very quiet over the last 2-months. They have not tried to talk their 'book'. **Staking** (aka monthly revenues): They are currently generating around \u00a312M per year in staking revenues. This figure is likely more. **Portfolio:** Their current portfolio stands around \u00a3180M and their market cap is currently \u00a3[264.006M](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/KR1:PZ) meaning that for an extra \u00a384M you are getting all the staking revenues and the likelihood of the current projects exploding. They will be huge. \n3. KR1 is even more profitable than ARBKF and has more upside IMO. They have negligible electricity costs as they do no 'proof of work', they simply invest in high-performing projects that carry out mainly '[proof-of-stake](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp). \n4. Management is gre\u00a3at. Try and name me other companies that have consistently beaten their targets over 5-years running. \n5. An uplisting is imminent. \n\n**Where can you buy $KROEF?** \n\nIt currently trades on the OTC [Pink Sheets](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/KROEF/overview), so your broker will need to have access to this. If people could comment on which brokers they use which have access that would be great as the list has updated since my last post. I see them uplisting to either OTCQB or even NASDAQ very soon, hence, why they have been so quiet. \n\nShout-out to FunkyFinance who does some great DD (see first link below) and wexboy's blog who I forgot to mention as a reference from my first post. Thanks, bro, (see 2nd link below). \n\nResources:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbRPONo33jc&amp;ab\\_channel=FunkyFinance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbRPONo33jc&amp;ab_channel=FunkyFinance)\n\n[https://wexboy.wordpress.com/2020/11/21/kr1-plc-the-crypto-alpha-bet/](https://wexboy.wordpress.com/2020/11/21/kr1-plc-the-crypto-alpha-bet/)\n\n \n\nI hope people make as much money from this as I have, as I really foresee a crash coming. These returns we are seeing are not normal, so grab whatever you can whilst it lasts. \n\nJust to finish, I am not advising anyone to buy this stock. You have to do your own research. Just wanted to share (in my opinion) a really good stock that I am long-on.",

        "selftext": "Hey folks, this is a copy of a blog post I recently wrote on how to effectively use live options flow to find good setups. You are free to use any live options flow tool since the tips and tricks remain the same. There are no direct links to any platform and no self-promotion. I made sure to remove all links from the post.\n\nOptions flow has gained great traction over the last few years. With a  booming retail trading market, more people are trying to leverage options flow to gauge market sentiment and get ahead of others. In this  post, we are going to talk about some tips on how to effectively use  live options flow to find excellent trading setups. Since millions of options are traded every day, finding solid setups can sometimes be like finding a needle in a haystack. Therefore, one needs to understand different technicalities of options flow to separate the wheat from the chaff. This post will assume that you already know what calls and puts are. If you do no, please refer to this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipf0Yg2Z4Gs) before continuing with this post.   \n\n### Type of Options Orders \n\nBefore we dive into the tips and tricks of using options flow data, we need to first talk about three different kinds of options orders that you will often see - **Sweeps**, **Splits**, and **Blocks**.  \n\n*Processing img 9xjofkng54i61...*\n\n# 1. Sweeps \n\nSweeps are orders that are split up into smaller trades and are completed via multiple exchanges. There are many reasons traders often trade via sweep orders. \n\n*Processing img b9mpihql54i61...*\n\nFirst, if someone has some extra information about a company and they are confident that the price will move in a particular direction, they will want to hide their knowledge by using a sweep order. Since sweep orders are filled as multiple small orders, most people are not able to see the underlying large activity. Second, if a trader wants to get their order filled as soon as possible, they can often choose a sweep order to leverage the liquidity from multiple exchanges. In essence, a  trader either wants to hide something or is in a hurry to complete a  trader. Because of this fact, sweeps often provide us a signal that someone knows something that we do not which is why they are trying to hide their trade or get it filled as soon as possible.  \n\n*Processing img wz4br7kn54i61...*\n\nThe image above illustrates the effectiveness of sweep orders. On  February 16, 2021, we had two sweep calls early in the morning for  $FUTU. The price of $FUTU was about 170 but one of the sweeps was for a  $200 strike which is very far out of the money strike. That tells us that someone is confident that the price of FUTU is going to increase shortly. How do we know if the price is expected to increase shortly? We look at the expiration date of the contract and see that there are only  3 days left till the contract expires. After that sweep, the price of  FUTU did increase by about 20 dollars in the next few hours. The same contract that was being traded for $6.47 was trading for $14.07 in a few hours. This means the person in the second row would have garnered about 100% profits in a couple of hours. This demonstrates the power of sweep orders and how they can be used to find flow that we can follow as well to make money.     \n\n# 2. Splits \n\nSimilar to sweeps, splits are large orders broken up into small orders that are filled on a single exchange. The only difference between sweeps and splits is that splits are filled on a single exchange.\n\n[How to best utilize splits](https://preview.redd.it/n1xl3dgq54i61.png?width=1900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a9b7126564af8bb758dd33f6892555e5fc6f46f)\n\nThe above example shows you a few splits for $CCIV on February 16, 2021.  The first split came in when CCIV's price was only at $41 and the strike price for that was $50 which is very far out of the money. Low and behold, the price went up to about 48 in the next few hours, and we had another few splits. Finally, the day ended with CCIV's price being at about $52 dollars. That is an increase of about 10 dollars in just a  couple of hours.     \n\n# 3. Blocks \n\nFinally, blocks are just very large single trades. Usually, its large institutions buying or selling a very large number of options contracts.  Those are considered as blocks. More specifically, any trade with at least 5000 volume is considered a block trade.\n\n[Finding good trades with block orders](https://preview.redd.it/4dyw3bb164i61.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b70823b93b7e39a29f01c5b457c857244ad03fac)\n\nHere is another example that shows you the power of block trades. Early  in the morning on February 16, 2020, we received a block trade worth  1.32 million and 8488 volume for $AMTX. In just a few hours, the price went from 8.5 to 9.25.     \n\n### Tips on Finding Effective Setups \n\nNow that we know what each order type means, we can discuss some concise  tips on how to effectively find good setups using options flow. These  tips are quite subjective and come from our own experience in using live  options flow to find trades. There are always more ways to look at the  flow since it is more of an art than a science. However, we hope these  will prove useful to you in your journey of becoming a better trader.      \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **BURSTS ARE GOOD:** Bursts of sweeps, splits, and block trades  with large premiums are often very useful. That can sometimes mean an  event is about to happen and the people who know about it are promptly  getting in before the price makes a big move.\n* **ABOVE ASK SHOWS CONFIDENCE:** Sweeps, splits, or blocks, when  traded above the ask price often provide strong signals. That means a  trader is willing to pay more than the ask price for the contracts. This shows confidence.\n* **SHORT EXPIRATIONS DEMONSTRATES URGENCY:** Similar to how a  trade above ask provides confidence, trades with very short expiration  dates also show urgency and confidence since traders are confident that  the price will move in the desired direction very soon.\n* **SKIP THE SPREADS:** Very often, it is hard to identify  whether a trade in the options flow is a buy/sell or part of a complex  strategy like spreads, strangles, etc. In different options flow tools,  vendors provide you data on whether a trade was part of a strategy or a  simple buy/sell. For newbies, it is often better to skip all trades that  are parts of strategies as it is slightly harder to infer directional  signals from them.    \n* **KEEP AN EYE ON FAR OTM STRIKES:** Whenever you see a  large amount being spent on very far out of the money strikes, be on  alert. Sometimes, if investors are confident in a large move, they will  buy far out of the money strikes which are cheaper than in the money and  at the money strikes.\n* **VOLUME &gt; OPEN INTEREST IS IMPORTANT:** When volume or a  trade is higher than the open interest for the options contract, that  can also sometimes depict urgency and confidence. That happens because  smaller open interest demonstrates lack of liquidity. If an investor is  still willing to trade the contract, that means they are confident.\n* **IMPLIED VOLATILITY (IV) IS MEAN REVERTING:** This is a  slightly hard point to understand but whenever IV increases  significantly, it is often better to not buy contracts for the  underlying stock. This happens because of a phenomena in financial  markets called [Mean Reversion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/meanreversion.asp).  It states that certain things eventually revert to their mean. For  instance, if IV gets too high, it is expected that it will eventually  return to its average value soon. If you buy a contract at a very high  IV, the decrease in IV will reduce your contract value thus causing you a  loss.\n* **BEWARE OF IV CRUSH:** Often times, before a big event like  earnings, IV goes up quite a bit. As discussed in the above point, it is  a good practice to stay away when this is the case. What usually  happens is that IV suddenly decreased after the event causing the  contract prices to drop with them. This is called an IV crush.\n\nThese are just some of our tips to keep in mind in order to find good  trading setups and improve your trading PNL. \n\n### Final Thoughts \n\nFinally, we would like to reiterate that analyzing options flow is more  of an art than a science. Please spend time looking at historical  patterns and build your own strategies. Options flow contains a rich  amount of data that if used correctly can immensely improve your  trading.",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI want to make it clear from the start that I am not a professional financial advisor. Everything I am about to write has come from my own research. You should cross check everything and make your own decision on what you will do with this information.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is not going to be a PUMP &amp; DUMP. I don't want to achieve that either. I report here because I am convinced of the idea and the company!  \n\n\nEDIT:  \n\nGuys! I did try my best to reply to your comments. Here is a Video showing how the process works. Of course this is very simplified: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb2urm2wTw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb2urm2wTw)\n\nI hope this helps you better understand what it's all about. Please inform yourself well before you invest. I do not recommend investing to anyone who does not believe in the idea. This company can also fail, you are warned. I welcome all others who are sure that this project will conquer the market.\n\n**What is it about?**\n\nI've been watching an interesting company since December 2020 that advertises with the following slogan: \"We exist to decarbonize the currently high carbon production footprint of lithiumion batteries used in electric vehicles.\" The company is called Vulcan Energy Resources\\[1\\].\n\nISIN: AU0000066086\n\nWKN: A2PV3A\n\n**How did you find the company?**\n\nI became aware of the company because I see that there is a trend towards sustainable investing\\[2\\]. So I started looking for a company that appealed to me. At some point I came across an article that a project was underway to extract lithium without damaging the environment\\[3\\]. Gripped by the topic, I spent several days trying to find out what was going on and what it was all about.\n\n**What about sustainability?**\n\nZERO CARBON LITHIUM: The project is called Zero Carbon Lithium\\[4\\] and is being driven by Vulcan Energy Resources as mentioned above. The current main way to extract and refine lithium, from hard rock mines, will emit about 1.05 billion tons of CO2 to produce the amount of lithium needed to electrify all the world's passenger cars. Unlike current lithium extraction methods, Zero Carbon Lithium will have virtually no impact on the public or the environment. That means no large open pit mines, no large, unsightly, water-guzzling evaporation ponds, or process plants that run on fossil fuels.\n\nAfter reading that, I was hooked for now. But not yet ready to invest. Moreover, the share was still a penny stock at the time. That was too risky for me. So I looked weekly to see if something is about to happen.\n\n**The Decision:**\n\nInvesting based on an idea is never a good idea, so I took a close look at the company and the idea:\n\n1. Since I already had a bad experience once, with such a young idea, I first looked how often and how well information is published\\[5\\]. Surprisingly, it is published diligently and everything fits so far. \u2714\n2. Publishing is one thing, the other is whether there is something behind it. Since listed companies have a disclosure obligation, it is easy to see whether the figures from the Investor Centre correspond to those on the stock exchange\\[6\\]. \u2714\n3. Financially, you can't do an analysis \u00e1 la Warren Buffet here. The company is still young, and has a lot to invest. Nevertheless, I took a look at what is going on. Quick Analysis: More assets than liabilities \u2714. Equity consistently increased \u2714. Cash flow and net income: naturally in the red due to the investments \u2716. More does not make sense here, as said value investing does not work here.\n4. Vulcan operates a lot of geothermal plants and is familiar with the matter. So there is internal and independent expertise in geothermal and lithium on site for project execution\\[7\\]. \u2714\n5. Location - the right market, compelling supply-demand dynamics: being at the center of the European lithium ion battery industry is a major advantage for a semi-bulk product. Europe will be the world's fastest-growing lithium ion battery production center in the 2020s, with no local supply of lithium hydroxide.\\[7\\] \u2714\n6. Positive framework study: world-leading industry experts in lithium extraction and geothermal energy are behind the first study of its kind, which provides a solid foundation for the start of feasibility studies planned soon.\\[7\\] \u2714\n7. I understood how the process works and read the feasibility study.Not only lithium is extracted but also other rare metals\\[9\\]. \u2714\n\nIf you go through my sources with interest, you will see that there is a very solid basis behind the project. But what was the deciding point for me to invest was the fact that Vulcan intentionally requested a trading halt while they were conducting the study to prevent wild speculation. This happened once in January2021\\[9\\] and once now around February 2021\\[10\\]. I got in in January because that was a sign to me that Vulcan was serious.\n\nIn addition, Vulcan gave a presentation to the EU Commission, with positive feedback. Vulcan has signed a binding agreement with the EU-funded EIT InnoEnergy as part of the Business Investment Platform (BIP) of the European Battery Alliance (EBA) initiative of the European Commission. This agreement is expected to significantly accelerate the momentum of Vulcan's Zero Carbon Lithium project. The project is located in Germany, at the center of the fastest growing lithium market in the world: the European battery industry for electric vehicles \\[11\\].\n\n**What's in store for the future?**\n\nI can't see into the future, of course, but I am sure that with this project electric vehicles will gain significant momentum. Also, the EU would be more independent and I personally like that a lot. In addition, there is no need to dry salt lakes or make bad environmental cuts like in other countries. I also see it critically that we consume here, and in mines at the other end of the world people have to work life-threatening for our luxury.\n\n**Is $VUL the next $GME?**\n\nPlease, this is not a comparison. This is about the environment and the future of next generations. I am against PUMP&amp;DUMP! If you are convinced of a company you invest and don't gamble!\n\n**Is now the right time?**\n\nI do not know. You have to decide that for yourself. I am invested myself in the meantime, because I am convinced of the idea therefore I will hold the share also with fluctuations. I got in at \\~4.00 - 5.00\u20ac.\n\nSources:\n\n\\[1\\] Vulcan Energy Resources: [https://v-er.com/](https://v-er.com/)\n\n\\[2\\] Sustainable Investing Trend: [https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/sustainability-investing-institutional-asset-owners](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/sustainability-investing-institutional-asset-owners)\n\n\\[3\\] Lithium Geothermal energy: [https://www.electrive.net/2020/06/15/lithium-gewinnung-aus-geothermie-anlagen-in-deutschland/](https://www.electrive.net/2020/06/15/lithium-gewinnung-aus-geothermie-anlagen-in-deutschland/)\n\n\\[4\\] Zero Carbon Lithium: [https://v-er.com/zero-carbon-lithium/](https://v-er.com/zero-carbon-lithium/)\n\n\\[5\\] Vulcan Investor Centre: [https://v-er.com/investor-centre/](https://v-er.com/investor-centre/)\n\n\\[6\\] Yahoo Finance VUL: [https://de.finance.yahoo.com/quote/6KO.F/financials?p=6KO.F](https://de.finance.yahoo.com/quote/6KO.F/financials?p=6KO.F)\n\n\\[7\\] Vulcan Facts: [https://www.geothermie.de/bibliothek/lexikon-der-geothermie/v/vulkan-energy-firma.html](https://www.geothermie.de/bibliothek/lexikon-der-geothermie/v/vulkan-energy-firma.html)\n\n\\[8\\] Vulcan Positive Pre Feasibility Study: [https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/6a9c79d2-5c99-40d7-ba32-72cd6ea3a6f6/PositivePreFeasibilityStudy](https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/6a9c79d2-5c99-40d7-ba32-72cd6ea3a6f6/PositivePreFeasibilityStudy)\n\n\\[9\\] Trading Halt January2021: [https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/e5371199-d0f8-4d91-82b1-f7e1ed7ebae6/TradingHalt](https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/e5371199-d0f8-4d91-82b1-f7e1ed7ebae6/TradingHalt)\n\n\\[10\\] Trading Halt February 2021: [https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/492bcfbd-6157-4aec-8542-f6641341578f/TradingHalt](https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/492bcfbd-6157-4aec-8542-f6641341578f/TradingHalt)\n\n\\[11\\] Vulcan signs with EU: [https://finfeed.com/small-caps/juniors/vul-signs-agreement-with-eu-backed-body-to-drive-the-vulcan-zero-carbon-lithium-project/](https://finfeed.com/small-caps/juniors/vul-signs-agreement-with-eu-backed-body-to-drive-the-vulcan-zero-carbon-lithium-project/)",

        "selftext": "Following on from a previous post where I was accused of bashing CBBT on baseless claims, I have decided to write a DD post to highlight the numerous red flags that none of the DD posts on CBBT post. I have no stake in the company, and I'm only sharing this to bring the conduct of the company to light amongst all the claims that this company will potentially cure Alzheimer's or the stock will reach a crazy PT. I'm sure many have heard of what happened last week to the tickers SCIE and COUV, so I think it is important that this information is brought to light so that a similar situation doesn't happen with this stock.\n\n**Company Ventures**\n\nCerebain used to be known as \"Discount Dental Materials Inc\" until 2012. [Let's take a look at the article from 2012 when their rebranding was announced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120302005104/en/Discount-Dental-Materials-Inc.-Acquires-Cerebain-Biotech-Corp). It notes that \"*The Company\u2019s business will revolve around the discovery of products for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease utilizing Omentum. The Company\u2019s approach will consider both a medical device solution as well as a synthetic drug solution. The Company\u2019s operations will be conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cerebain Biotech Corp*.\" This was 2012, now let's look at the very limited information the company has about its Alzheimer's venture on its own website: \"*Cerebain Biotech (OTC: CBBT) is a development-stage medical device company focused on the creation and clinical development of a minimally invasive implantable device. The device leverages the clinically observable, positive impact that omentum stimulation has on cognitive function as related to dementias, and in particular, Alzheimer\u2019s disease*.\" You can see that they are still in the same stage they were in in 2012, **there is NOTHING to suggest that this product has had even a basic level of development in these years**. No studies, no peer to peer reviews, no medical professionals who are involved and have been linked to the company.\n\nI will not make comment on the science itself, as I'm not expert, but I've heard people who claim they work in the field on both sides give countering arguments on whether this technology has a chance of being successful. You don't have to be an expert, however, to know that Alzheimer's is one of the most funded R&amp;D health conditions in the world. Companies and educational institutions are forking out millions upon millions each year to find a solution. How can this OTC ticker that no one has ever heard of, no scientist or medical professional has aligned themselves with, no journal has ever published a study of, possibly be anywhere even slightly successful in the development of a device to counter this disease?\n\n[**https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/**](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) **is the website that documents every clinical trial conducted around the world, both public and private. There is NOTHING here mentioning Cerebain Biotech**. The truth is, in the 9 years of this company's existence, they have made no progress in R&amp;D.\n\nIf you look at the company website and follow the address listed (*600 Anton Blvd., Suite 1100, Costa Mesa, California\u00a0 92626*), **you'll find all sorts of businesses claiming to be operating from the exact same suite**. It turns out to be a REGUS facility, which are temporary rental offices. If it were a legitimate biotech company, it would list their lab as their primary address. No one who has any capital or owns real estate to work in lists a REGUS office, let alone a company claiming to be developing an Alzheimer's drug!\n\nWe have heard of many P&amp;D OTC tickers that have been suspended by the SEC for various reasons, more recently SCIE and COUV. Look [here](https://www.whistleblowerllc.com/sec-moves-against-covid-19-investment-scams/), and you will find info about the following: *\"On May 1, 2020, the SEC suspended NASDAQ trading for* [*CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.*](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2020/34-88802-o.pdf) *and* [*Moleculin Biotech, Inc*](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2020/34-88801-o.pdf)*., both of Houston, Texas. The SEC took that action based on statements claiming the two companies expected to \u201cexpedite\u201d regulatory approval for a potential COVID-19 drug. The SEC questioned the accuracy and adequacy of those statements. As a result, trading in both companies was suspended.\"*\n\nThese companies were suspended by the SEC from trading because they made inaccurate statements on the progress of FDA approval for a potential drug. [Here](https://www.newswire.com/news/cerebain-biotech-today-announced-it-plans-to-seek-fda-approval), in 2016, CBBT announced that they plan to seek approval for their medical device. Their website also notes that *\"Existing therapeutics have been unable to halt disease progression or extend life in a meaningful way. Cerebain\u2019s novel device approach is supported by research and patient outcomes. Clinical evidence supports the Company\u2019s working approach, that omentum stimulation improves cognitive function in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Minimally invasive, one-time device implantation will overcome challenges associated with previous omentum stimulation procedures that are highly invasive\".* **To make such a statement that their device is supported by research and patient outcomes is teetering of being a fraudulent claim that could lead to the SEC suspending the company at any point.** This, as well as the lack of financials and acquisition of a much larger company do raise a lot of questions about the legitimacy behind this company.\n\n**The company also claim to hold patents, and some good DD on that can be found** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CBBT/comments/lkfbxm/cbbt_patents_reasons_for_concern/)**, which also raises concern.**\n\nUp until the news of the acquisition with PKG, the company has been very quiet since 2018. It seems that CBBT is now acting as a shell company for other ventures, but this makes little sense considering everything else about the company. I will not go deeply into the merger with PKG, as there is very little info available surrounding it and why it's happening.\n\n**Financials**\n\nLet's take a look at the [financials of this company](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/CBBT/profile). **CBBT has not filed financial reports with the SEC since summer 2019**, hence why there is a \"STOP\" sign on the tickers page which notes that the \"Company is not current in its reporting obligations under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\" The company claims that they will update their financials once the merger is complete, but considering **it has been over 1.5 years since the last filing**, there is no excuse as to why nothing was filed. **OTC Pink Basic Disclosure Guidelines are literally the lowest standard of financial reporting a publicly traded company can adhere to,** this should be a huge red flag. It is also suspicious that PKG, a multi-million dollar generating company who supposedly has government contracts would choose to hand over its assets to a small company which doesn't even file with the SEC. Maybe it is because they know something we don't, but this should be a cause for concern as much as it is a cause for celebration.\n\nI can't access the last 8K report the company did file as the link is dead. But looking at the balance sheet and income statement from 2018, you will find that this company is making no money and has no tangible assets worth anything. However, they are a biotech company so I will give them the benefit of the doubt here, as it is common for these bio-med companies to have no revenue until their product is FDA approved. I would expect them to have assets worth something though, if they are involved in R&amp;D (scientific lab equipment).\n\nThe share price has gone up 400% in the last 3 months - any investor should be wary when a stock has moved that much over no real news.\n\n**Company structure, employees and shareholders**\n\nThe share structure of this company is also interesting. There are currently 1,250,000,000 authorised shares and 716,366,013 outstanding shares. This is fairly high, but not uncommon for a Pink Sheet. However it does mean that the market cap for this company is $230,669,856. Considering that this would roughly be the market cap I'd expect on the merger being complete, I wouldn't bet on this stock running much higher before going back down, and certainly not anywhere near $1. Fundamentally, the float is too high and if we compare to the top companies on the OTCQX (highest level of OTC), most have a similar or lower market cap. I don't like to focus much on market cap though when looking at pennies, because these stocks are volatile and most of us aren't interested in this ticker holding a certain value, but more to profit on the run.\n\nIn the past year or so, the company has had two major securities purchases at the price of $0.001 - 15,407,421 shares in Dec 19 and then 70,920,235 in Dec 2020. Very cheap shares considering the price that this stock is currently trading at (around $0.32 now), **if the company were confident in their future after the acquisition, why did they offer shares so cheap**? This purchase is filed under a SCHEDULE 13G/A letter, which must be filed if a single entity purchases at least 5% worth of the company's shares. Both of these purchases were carried out by a company named EMA Financial LLC. I have seen countless posts that mention EMA as an institutional investor, using this to try and convince people that large scale institutional investors are interested in CBBT, meaning the company is doing something right. However, this is far from the truth. EMA are hardly Blackrock or ARK, they are simply a small investment firm and [**all their current holdings**](https://fintel.io/i/ema-financial) **are other Pink Sheet stocks that are also delinquent in their SEC reporting, most of them also listed as \"Dark or Defunct\"**. So this is the calibre of company that CBBT is at, there is certainly no impressive institutional investing happening here that should be gloated about. Another commonly mentioned shareholder is [Brad Vroom](https://fintel.io/so/us/cbbt), a former Apple executive. While it may seem impressive that a former Apple exec is a shareholder, the fact is that he purchased just 400k worth of shares in 2012, days after CBBT merged with '[Discount Dental Materials Inc](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120302005104/en/Discount-Dental-Materials-Inc.-Acquires-Cerebain-Biotech-Corp).' Mr Vroom only purchased a relatively small amount of shares at the time, and the likelihood is that he has forgotten about this investment since. The company has not actually achieved anything in this time as far as shareholders are aware, but we will touch on this soon.\n\nIn terms of employees of the company, well, [there are only 2](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CBBT/profile/) according to Yahoo. Strange for a company allegedly researching and developing into Alzheimer's solutions. On their SEC filings (which due to the company not keeping up to date with them are therefore outdated), one named employee is Wesley Tate, the CFO, who is also listed on their website. It is hard to find out anything else about this man online.\n\nTheir other listed employee is the CEO, Mr Eric Andre Clemons. It is difficult to find information on this guy except on the company website and there are no photos of him anywhere online. This is definitely suspicious to me, a CEO who is supposedly proud of his company and who wants the confidence of shareholders would have his face somewhere online, even on a Linkedin profile, unless he has something to hide. He is paid a nice salary of $231.93k, quite high considering the lack of revenue Cerebain makes. We can only wonder how his salary is so high, but let's hope it's not through duping investors...\n\n**Company conduct**\n\n**Cerebain and Mr Clemons were actually** [**taken to court** in 2016, over a case filed by a former employee of the company](https://casetext.com/case/miller-v-cerebain-biotech-corp). She claimed that she was [hired as a senior member of the management team](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140922005160/en/Cerebain-Biotech-Engages-Miriam-Weber-Miller-Industry-Veteran-as-Corporate-Vice-President), which was even reported in the media to bolster the company's credibility in the biotech field due to her vast experience, to be paid a salary of $140k per annum. Cerebain Biotech breached this contract and if you read the transcript of the hearing, you will see how unprofessional the conduct of Mr Clemons is. The case went in favour of Ms Miller, meaning the defendant (Clemons) was required to reply to the complaint, which ended in a settlement of $120k. You can read the SEC filings by CBBT on this settlement and the court case [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1453099/000147793217004520/cbbt_10k.htm).\n\nLet's look a bit more into the lack of professionalism in the company. It is worth drawing attention to the company's use of social media to announce the acquisition with PKG. The company has made several posts on Twitter/Facebook, stating that the merger will be happening, giving deadlines. First November, then December, then January, all of these deadlines were missed. Now, acquisitions can take many months to complete, but **why give shareholders deadlines if you can't keep to any of them**? The only information we have right now from both parties is that they have signed a Letter of Intent back in August, and CBBT claims that they have paid 700k to purchase the assets of PKG. This is speculative, but I would think that the assets to PKG would cost a lot more considering the breadth of their work. Furthermore, just speculating, but EMA bought roughly 70m shares in December priced at $0.001, which is worth 700k. Considering that CBBT has been making no revenue elsewhere and the timing of EMA's securities purchase, it is possible that CBBT used that purchase of common stock to fund the purchase of PKG's assets. That's just something to think about, not something that should be of much concern to anyone.\n\nBack to the company's use of social media to engage with shareholders about the deadlines it keeps setting for the acquisition being complete. No one asked for a deadline, but **the effort to be overly transparent here is odd considering that they can't even file basic SEC financials**. A company that is serious and professional in its conduct would primarily make sure that they disclose letters to investors officially rather than writing a social media post. To me, this seems like a company more interested in generating hype and attention rather than building trust and a long-standing relationship with its shareholders. The company now claims that they are \"close\" to completing their deal, with it being down to their attorneys to get through all the paperwork. Also note that the company will have a lot to catch up with in terms of financial filing too.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis was posted so that people get the full picture on this ticker. I was accused of bashing this ticker based on no evidence earlier, so here is my evidence. My aim here isn't to \"bash\", but to play devil's advocate in a time when we are overloaded with so much positive information about a stock without any analysis, or even any mention, of red flags. The truth is, most of these pink sheet companies are pink sheets because of how shady they are. The SEC is cracking down on many of these pink sheet stocks, especially more so now considering the massive influence some of these Twitter/Dscord \"furus\" have on pumping sometimes defunct or fraudulent companies. As always, do your own DD and don't play with money you can't afford to lose. Also, take profits and don't be greedy!",

        "selftext": "I consider myself a reasonably knowledgeable investor: I've certainly been managing my own investments for a couple decades, and reached financial independence last summer.\n\nI've been lurking in SPACs and have tried to grok it all, and quite frankly it seems like a lot of work.  That is, hat's off to all of you for your DD, your understanding of the space, and your willingness to share.  Congrats to those who have more time (and courage) than me, and have taken the plunge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I just don't think I have the bandwidth to stay on top of it all (I'm FI, but have not retired from my demanding job).  I both like the idea of encouraging investment in new companies and novel ideas, and, of course, the potential return from such ventures.  As such, I've decided the best course of action for me is to go long with an actively managed ETF in SPAC space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going with  SPCX which currently holds the following, you'll see many of those you're used to reading about in r/SPACs :  \n\n\n|Holding|Name|Percent of Holding|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Churchill Capital Corp IV Ordinary Shares - Class A|8.94%|\n|2|Starboard Value Acquisition Corp Units (1 Ord Share Class A &amp; 1/6 War)|4.09%|\n|3|Cohn Robbins Holdings Corp Ordinary Shares - Class A|3.85%|\n|4|CC Neuberger Principal Holdings II Ordinary Shares - Class A|2.99%|\n|5|Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp Ordinary Shares - Class A|2.89%|\n|6|Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp IV Ordinary Shares - Class A|2.43%|\n|7|Hennessy Capital Investment Corp V Units (1 Ord Share Class A &amp; 1/4 War)|2.41%|\n|8|Altimeter Growth Corp 2 Ordinary Shares - Class A|2.39%|\n|9|SVF Investment Corp Units (1 Ord Share Class A &amp; 1/5 War)|2.27%|\n|10|Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp VI Ordinary Shares - Class A|2.14%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe premise here is that for my \\~1% management expense ratio, I'm getting someone else to time the roller-coaster, and do the DD.  That seems entirely reasonable, and I'd even pay more (I was investing back when mutual funds were 1.5-3.0% MER, so this seems like a great deal).  With almost 150M AUM, I'm also confident in the liquidity.\n\nYou can get more details on SPCX here:  [https://www.spcxetf.com/the-fund/](https://www.spcxetf.com/the-fund/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am already 840 shares long, I'm not here to pump, but I certainly have some skin in the game:  \n\n\n*Processing img 4tmli53rkag61...*\n\nI'd be happy to hear about other actively managed products in the SPAC space.\n\nAll the best to everyone in their investments decisions.

        "selftext": "The long weekend made me think how the negotiations are going. And I think I have good news (at least I feel good about my dd into what the PIF would potentially want). Please feel free to criticize my dd, but just know it's just a ballpark estimate :) \n\n**Facts:**\n\n* we know that Michael Klein is a value investor (seen in previous deals; for example with Skillsoft CCX shareholders got 65.5%; for the Multiplan deal CCXX shareholders got 18.6% and he also emphasized it during the interview around 4 weeks ago: He only agrees to a deal if the price/valuation is right)\n* we know that the \"transaction could be valued at up to $15 billion\" according to Bloomberg 1 month ago. This number was most likely specifically brought up to test how the market would react.\n* we also know that this article backfired (at least for Klein's bargaining power): He needs to get this deal to not lose credibility + the Saudi fund PIF (who owns 67% of Lucid) most likely asks now for much more than a 15b valuation.\n\nSo, this got me thinking. How high of a valuation could the Saudis realistically be asking Klein for?\n\n* we know that the Saudis invested 1.3b into Lucid for a 67% stake on September 17, 2018, valuing Lucid at 1.94b on this day (\"The California-based Lucid Motors\u2014an electric-vehicle company in which PIF invested $1.3 billion for a 67 percent stake\u2014has also said it wants to build a factory in Saudi Arabia.\" [https://wired.me/business/startups/saudi-arabia-pif-tech/](https://wired.me/business/startups/saudi-arabia-pif-tech/?fbclid=IwAR1em9ELjGYJjgJUK-tLIDlpsaZ_n0bRZrGSOhaUe2l3eHV-0gcLqcwYPE0))\n* We can compare Tesla's valuation rise from this day (50b) until today (783b), which is a 15.66x.\n\n**Speculation:**\n\n* So, the highest realistic valuation the Saudis could ask for is 1.94b x 15.66 = 30.38b or to make it simple 30 billion.\n* Now, the Saudis know that 30b is crazy to ask for, since Lucid is by no means Tesla. So, probably they are asking for 25b at the most.\n\nTherefore, I conclude Micheal Klein who wants 15b and PIF which wants 25b will agree **around 20 billion instead of the original 15 billion valuation**.What do you guys think about my reasoning? Does this make any sense?\n\nPS It's also noteworthy that PIF already lost many billions due to selling 8.2 million shares by the end of the third quarter of 2019 (this war around 5% of Tesla's equity). And we all know what happened to Tesla stock last year. PIF will make sure they don't make similar mistakes with an EV again.\n\nPPS Speaking about Tesla, I created a youtube project with 4 other Tesla long-term investors (over 3 years, one guy even over 5 years) and we thought we will create a **video series on Lucid**. This here is our first short video titled: \"Tesla long-term investors share their thoughts on Lucid Motors\": \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCfkX8n7bGw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCfkX8n7bGw)\n\nThe videos are short and to the point (at least that's the goal). We plan to cover the following topics in the coming weeks: \"Lucid's battery technology\", \"Lucid's new factory in Saudi Arabia\", \"Lucid's next car, the Gravity SUV\" etc. If you have any topic ideas, feel free to comment!\n\nWe call ourselves Growth Stock *Research* since 3 of us are researchers / PhDs at their universities. We don't hype, but research in a neutral manner with good and bad points, so the viewers can decide for themselves.",

        "selftext": "By now we have all heard the rumor that AACQ has pivoted from fintech and will be targeting Origin Materials. Origin states on their [website](https://www.originmaterials.com/):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Origin is the world's leading **carbon negative** materials company. The Origin platform turns the carbon found in biomass into useful materials, while **eliminating the need for fossil resources** and **capturing carbon** in the process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel that this company will take off for a number of reasons that I outline below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 1. The Biden Administration Carbon Tax\n\nThere is the very real possibility that the Biden administration will implement a carbon tax program.\n\nWith Democrats holding the House and Senate, this possibility has gone up significantly.\n\nThere will be pressure to act swiftly and decisively to make up for [lost time](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-carbontax-idUSKBN16S2ZF) under the Trump administration. There is bipartisan support for carbon tax initiatives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;President Joe Biden\u2019s allies in the business community have been meeting to craft a set of proposals, including a potential **carbon tax**, to help pay for an expected $2 trillion infrastructure plan.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One of those efforts, which started just after Biden was declared the winner of the election in late November, is being led by longtime Biden ally and New York business leader Dennis Mehiel, along with former **Dow Chemical CEO** Andrew Liveris, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. \n\nSource: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/21/biden-infrastructure-plan-carbon-tax.html), [Axios](https://www.axios.com/yellen-biden-carbon-pricing-energy-emissions-eee629c7-b4db-4f95-9d98-874269efdddd.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2. US rejoining the Paris Agreement\n\nOn day 1, Biden rejoined the [Paris Agreement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/paris-climate-agreement/). Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.\n\nBut in order to actually hit the goals set out in the Paris Agreement, there needs to be **large-scale** application of **technologies** that can **remove CO2** from the air **on a huge scale.**\n\n**Negative emissions technologies are a MUST in order to meet Paris Agreement Goals**\n\nSource: [United Nations Climate Change](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/28_EASAC%20Report%20on%20Negative%20Emission%20Technologies.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3. The social cost of carbon\n\nThe Biden Administration is bringing back the Social Cost of Carbon and will use it to push for carbon-cutting initiatives. This was undone under the Trump Administration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What is the social cost of carbon? It\u2019s a tool used in federal benefit-cost analysis to account for the damage greenhouse gas pollution inflicts on society, whether it comes in the form of deadly heat waves, water shortages or disappearing crops or animals.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One of its champions, Michael Greenstone, says it can also be regarded as \u201cthe benefit, in money terms, of reducing carbon emissions.\u201d Those benefits can justify regulations that make polluting activities more expensive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In 2010, when the formula was first used, the social cost of carbon was set at $21 in 2010, a figure that had risen to an inflation-adjusted $42 per ton by 2020. (For comparison, the cost of a ton of carbon in the European Union\u2019s emissions-trading market was $46 on Feb. 12.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Obama administration used the figure in its calculations of the costs and benefits of dozens of regulations. But by tinkering with the formula\u2019s assumptions, the Trump administration lowered the SCC practically to zero, allowing it to try and undo many of those same rules.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What does Biden have in mind? President Biden reactivated the interagency group responsible for calculating the social cost of greenhouse gases.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He gave economists 30 days to produce interim numbers that the administration can use in its first months of rulemaking, and requested final numbers by January 2022.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Biden has already signaled that he will embed considerations of climate risk throughout the government, giving economic estimates of the benefits of **carbon-cutting paramount importance** in policy.\n\nSource: [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/why-biden-is-reviving-climate-changes-magic-number/2021/02/13/b1a1196c-6dea-11eb-a66e-e27046e9e898_story.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 4. Climate change Corporate Governance\n\nCorporations will have no choice but to move into carbon negative solutions as they grapple with how to mitigate risk from climate change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Climate change is a potential strategic risk to companies, and it is therefore the **duty of the board to identify and manage it** in the same way as any other strategic risk.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Whether or not climate is specified as a fiduciary duty under the corporate governance code, directors have the duty to promote the success of the company and to act with due care, skill and diligence. **Failing to identify, assess, deal with or disclose material climate risks is a potential failure of corporate governance.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Board members or their companies may **expose themselves to legal action if they fail to identify, respond to or disclose material climate risks**. The risk of exposure is particularly high for directors of companies that operate in sectors that are especially vulnerable to climate risks, namely energy; transportation; agriculture, food and forest products; materials and buildings and financial services.\n\nSource: [KPMG](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/03/building-effective-climate-governance.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The links between climate change and business are becoming increasingly evident and inextricable. Business decisions and actions will slow or accelerate climate change, and climate change will drive risks and opportunities for business. Increasingly, **board directors are expected to ensure that climate-related risks and opportunities are appropriately addressed.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Good governance should **intrinsically include effective climate governance**. To this point, climate change is simply another issue that drives financial risk and opportunity, which boards inherently have the duty to address with the same rigor as any other board topic.\n\nSource: [World Economic Forum](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Creating_effective_climate_governance_on_corporate_boards.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 5. Brand awareness and sustainability\n\nConsumers are increasingly factoring in a product's sustainability attributes into their purchasing behavior and **73% of consumers surveyed by Nielsen say they are willing to change their consumption habits to reduce their environmental impact.**          \n\nAccording to Nielsen's vice president, global responsibility and sustainability, Julia Wilson, consumers will spend up to **$150bn on sustainable products by 2021**, however not all sustainability attributes are valued equally in their eyes.\n\nIn a study of more than 21,000 US households, Nielsen analyzed consumers' attitudes towards various sustainable attributes across 13 product categories.

        "selftext": "**WE ARE NOT FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.** This is not Financial advice so please do your DD!! \n\nThis DD was written the 2/4/2021, I am currently even more bullish on this stock with the current BTC price of 49k.\n\nThis stock is about to explode and has the possibility to x10 x20 or more. \n\n# Thesis\n\nWe are entering probably a big bull run due to many factors such as the US printing trillions, a general acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class and potentially institutional buying. Basically if you believe that Bitcoin will rally ARGO Blockchain is a leveraged play for Bitcoin. **They are primarily a Bitcoin miner who leases most of the mining machines and is ahead of MARA &amp; RIOT in some aspects with 1/5th of their market cap.**\n\nAlong with its market cap, Argo is primarily traded on the UK stock exchange, flying under the radar from the other miners in this space. With expansion plans to be listed in the US.\n\n**Idea &amp; Research**\n\nFirst of all, I need to explain how ARGO Blockchain works and why it's ahead of its peers. They share monthly their Operational update which mentions how many Bitcoins they mined and the margin.So for January, the margin was 71% (highest in the sector). They manage to do this due to the Canadian facilities in a cold climate and their strategic partnerships. Additionally they announced that they bought 172.5BTC during the dip for HODL. They are clearly believing in the Bull Run and leveraging for it.  [https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/argo\\_blockchain/news/rns/story/ry4z38r](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/argo_blockchain/news/rns/story/ry4z38r)\n\nAdditionally, what makes them completely undervalued compared to peers like MARA &amp; RIOT is their ability to expand mining capacity until the end of Q2 2021 to 1.68 exahash. For comparison MARA &amp; RIOT will receive their first deliveries in Q4 2021.\n\n[https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/argo\\_blockchain/news/rns/story/x4m9ldx](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/argo_blockchain/news/rns/story/x4m9ldx)\n\nThey are also fully transparent compared to peers and post updates on twitter frequently and do Q&amp;As. The miner space is profound for shadiness and ARGO is tackling that with their 100% transparency.\n\nThe text below is something that **Danny29** wrote mid-December and this thesis hasn\u2019t changed at all. In my opinion it has improved exponentially due to the operational excellence and expansion of ARGO Blockchain.\n\n\u201c*With ARB let's stick to the facts. BTC is currently around $29,000.00 and in a strong bull run. ARB is making a net profit of around $20,000.00 per coin at current prices. They are mining around 120 a month. Their mining capacity is increasing by 50% from next February. They should be looking at mining 180 BTC a month give or take, 2160 a year*.\u201d\n\n**THIS IS BASED ON PREVIOUS HASHRATE NUMBERS. NOT THE UPDATED ONES AFTER Q2 2021. With the updated numbers it should be almost 2x those net profits. Look at** ***Fundamentals below.***\n\nLet's look at likely profit against the average BTC price:\n\n1. no change: $29,000.00 = \u00a332m net profit per annum\n2. BTC average of $40,000.00 = \u00a350m net profit per annum\n3. BTC average of \u00a350,000.00 = \u00a365m net profit per annum\n\nPotential profit range on current prices or increase to $50,000.00 BTC of \u00a332m to 65m net. Plus they already hold 178 BTC which is worth \u00a33.8m. So that gives a profit range most likely for the next 12 months of \u00a335m to \u00a370m overall. PE ratio in American tech companies is high. LSE is a boring place mind full of square idiots. So let's take a conservative view and say an appropriate PE to value the company is x 15. That would give depending on the BTC price the next year a market cap valuation of \u00a3525m to \u00a31 billion. The current market cap is \u00a3100m!\n\nSo the actual future growth in this stock presuming a BTC price of $29,000.00 - $50,000.00 should be \u00a31.80 to \u00a33.40 rather than 34p! That is assuming a steady BTC performance over the next 12 months.\n\nLet's play negative. Suppose the BTC price pulls back and averages just $20,000.00. In that case ARB would make a profit of around \u00a321m including the BTC they currently hold. That still gives them a modest PE x 15 market cap of \u00a3315m which is a target share price of \u00a31.07 - and that is in a bad year!\n\nAs others have said, I do not see how the share price is not going to hit \u00a31 at some point and there is scope to push to \u00a32.00 and above without BTC needed to do much from its current position\u201d\n\nAnother factor that keeps this company undervalued is the limited access from US investors. It\u2019s currently listed on the OTC Markets but based on some appointments of US advisors and a US institution buying **\u00a322.4 million** of shares at **\u00a3**0.80, it shows that there is support and vision to uplist on NASDAQ. If it lists there i assume some people will discover that MARA &amp; RIOT are potentially valued correctly or maybe overvalued and jump in ARGO as it can have more room to run.\n\n# Expansion\n\nArgo, the leading cryptocurrency miner based in the UK (LSE: ARB), is pleased to announce that it has appointed XMS Capital Partners, LLC, a US headquartered financial services firm, to assist the Company in expanding its relationships with US investors.\n\nPeter Wall, Chief Executive of Argo Blockchain, said: \"We are delighted to appoint XMS Capital Partners. Following our listing on the OTCQB market earlier this week, we are seeking to strengthen our visibility in the US market and build investor relationships. XMS is perfectly placed to help us achieve our goals.\"\n\nPress Release 15 January Appointment of Communications Advisor Argo, the leading cryptocurrency miner based in the UK (LSE: ARB), is pleased to announce that it has appointed Wachsman, the US public relations firm specialised in technology, to expand its communications in the North America. Peter Wall, Chief Executive of Argo Blockchain, said: \"We are delighted to appoint Wachsman.

        "selftext": " \n\nAlright y'all,\n\nMy last DD post aged quite well and figured I'd put something else together for you.\n\nThat last DD post was on ACU - Aurora Solar Technologies. Posted on January 9th, 2021 with a share price of .375. Closed February 12th, 2021 at a price of .74. With their new Saas product just being released, I still believe there is a ton of upside there. Here's the post if you want to take a look:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadapennystocks/comments/ktkod0/acuv\\_aurora\\_solar\\_dd\\_for\\_an\\_undervalued\\_green/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadapennystocks/comments/ktkod0/acuv_aurora_solar_dd_for_an_undervalued_green/)\n\nLet's get into the next company, shall we. CMC - Cielo Waste Solutions. This one is also in the renewable energy space and imo, is probably better upside right now at their current prices. Currently own appx. 190K shares of CMC at about .095.\n\nEssentially what this company does is take waste, put it through their process, and end up with renewable transportation diesel, jet fuel, and naphtha fuel. They can take almost any feedstock other than glass and metals, including wood, plastics, tires, construction waste, and municipal organic and solid waste.\n\nFrom their website -\n\n\"All developed countries throughout the world require a minimum blend of renewable diesel be used in all transportation diesel fuel. Cielo\u2019s renewable fuel can be used in highway, air, ocean, and railway sectors, and as a fuel in remote off-grid communities. Cielo's renewable naphtha will be used in the diluent, condensate and gasoline blending markets.\"\n\nThey've been working on this process for 17 years and have gotten to the point at their main facility, where they are able to have the process creating 1000 litres per hour of renewable fuels. The site is operating 24 hours a day. As of right now, they have an agreement to take CP's old rail ties and are using that wood as the feedstock.\n\nAt this main facility in Aldersyde, Alberta, they will be upgrading the plant this summer to expand the capacity to 2000 l/h. They have also ordered the equipment they'll need for the desulphurization of the fuels they produce. This will allow them to get a better price for the fuels and also allow them to be used in more applications. This is expected to be installed by end of Q1 2021. \n\nIn November they signed a pre-sale commercial deal to sell 60,000 litres in anticipation of this desulphurization, at $1.25 per litre.  Cielo's cost is between  0.45 - $0.75.  They are able to achieve this low cost to create the diesel because they are getting the feedstock(wood, trash, etc) at such a low price.  That's compared to biodiesel which uses expensive crops like canola, corn, etc.\n\nThe great thing is that Cielo has a very effective, easily duplicated process now. They have agreements in place with Joint Venture partners to build another 5 facilities throughout Alberta. They are expected to break ground in Dunmore(Q2 21), Grand Prairie(Q4 21), Calgary and Edmonton(Q2 22). They have also purchased land in Medicine Hat, unsure when construction starts there. The CEO has stated he wants 40 facilities underway throughout North America in the next 5 years.\n\nFor the Dunmore facility, the plan is to build it to allow for 12,000 litres per hour capacity or 100 million litres per year of high-grade renewable fuel. The CEO anticipates that they will convert 200,000 tonnes of garbage into fuel to meet these numbers per year.\n\nCielo's process is patented in North America and Canada.  They have all municipal and Provincial permits in place with little Canadian competition.  There are no major renewable diesel producers in Canada that can sell to this market.\n\nThere is an active group on [CEO.ca](https://ceo.ca/) where one of Cielo's board members, Lionel Robbins, frequently visits. He is a wealth of information and is very accessible to anyone with questions. I'd recommend anyone interested to go through his old posts where he covers pretty much everything. Here's his post history link:\n\n[https://ceo.ca/@lionel](https://ceo.ca/@lionel)\n\nAs far as how the Joint Ventures work with Cielo, the JV partners are responsible for putting up 100% of the initial funds to build the facilities. Here's how the numbers work out, per Lionel:\n\n\"@Lionel - Good morning everyone. I have seen quite a bit of information with regards to Cielo's revenue share on JV's, short term cash flow, etc, so I just wanted to put out a bit of information from the MOU's and some previous PR's, to summarize... [u/r](https://www.reddit.com/u/r/).p.56 has most of the information correct here in terms of the JV agreements between RenewableU/Cielo, Seymour/Cielo and any follow-on JV's. The JV partner is responsible for sourcing 100% of the funds to build and commission the new facility, and then will receive 70% of the profits per year until they receive the equivalent of that build cost back, with Cielo getting the other 30%. Once the cap cost recovery is complete, Cielo will then receive 50.1% of the profits going forward, with the JV partner getting the other 49.9% That gives Cielo some significant cash flow even during the cap cost return phase, as they will have no debt involved in the project. In terms of the estimated 24 month period to build, Cielo has positive cash flow at that point as well, receiving 7% of the cap cost to manage the builds. They would receive the 7% as the build draws are taken, giving them some consistent cash flow throughout the 24 months before the plants actually fire up. With most of the JV projects estimated to cost in the $50M to $80M range (depending on initial volume planned), 7% on several JV's is not a small number for Cielo to see in their pockets while waiting for the cash flow from operations. Cielo will also be ramping up to the last phase of Aldersyde during that time, to produce 2000 LPH and have its own sales revenue for additional cash flow.\"\n\nHere's some more info from Lionel on various aspects of the business and Process:\n\n2020-09-09\n\n\"I am communications director for Don, as well as a board member so obviously I can\u2019t divulge anything but already public information, but will do my best. Just a clarification on Aldersyde\u2019s breakeven point, it\u2019s about 350 litres per hour production, not per day. The upgrades recently completed and noted in most recent PR, will allow Cielo to ramp up to that point, and beyond to an estimated 1000 lph which will create some positive cash flow for Cielo while the full scale facilities are being constructed across the province and beyond. For the question of feedstock, every facility can accommodate multiple feedstocks so it won\u2019t be a matter of directing a single source to one specific plant. Lots of excitement and positivity out in Aldersyde these days. The tour with the Alberta provincial government ministers, and others, couldn\u2019t have gone any better. Alberta is setting themselves on a path to diversifying their economy to have less reliance on O&amp;G, and have Cielo firmly in their sites now as a part of that plan. Finance Minister Travis Toews had positive comments on his social media feeds right after the tour. For anyone already in the Calgary area, or planning to be in the near future, Don loves giving tours so please feel free to check in with us on available date and times.\"\n\n2020-09-10\n\n\"On terms of production for the commercial-scale facilities, the design Cielo has is \u201cmodular\u201d in nature, where each unit will be able to produce an estimated 2000 lph. The goal for each facility is a minimum of 2 modular units, or 4000 lph capacity to start, but that can be increased quite easily, with the only holdup being the availability of feedstock volumes. It takes approximately 3.5 tonnes of feedstock to make 2000 lph. In large volume areas such as Edmonton, Calgary, etc, it\u2019s conceivable that feedstock agreements could justify facility builds to accommodate much more than 4000 lph to start, with the JV\u2019s in places like Grande Prairie, Medicine Hat, etc likely starting at the 4000 and ramping up from there at a later date.\n\nIn terms of interest for more refineries, there are several MOU\u2019s in place for joint venture facility builds. RenewableU has offer to build in Grande Prairie, Medicine Hat, Lethbridge and Halifax, with plans for additional. Seymour Capital has a MOU for Calgary facility, and several indigenous groups have expressed interest for a JV as well. There is interest from US and overseas, but first focus is getting a few Canadian facilities built.\n\nIn terms of tinkering with the mix to allow multiple feedstocks, it\u2019s more a matter of specific temperature mix by feedstock type, no actual adjustment to equipment is needed, so facilities can transition through various feedstocks quite easily and quickly.\n\nUnfortunately most of the details on the CP Rail tie feedstock agreement aren't public as of yet so I can't answer your specific question just yet. CP is excited about the project, and wants to time the full release of details for when they are ready on their end. In more \"generic\" terms for feedstock handling and processing...\n\nall type of feedstock eventually ends up in what essentially is \"powder\" form at the end of the day. The feedstock is first processed through a grinding facility that breaks it down into manageable size (about 2\" or less), and then goes into a second grinding facility (which will be on site at all facilities, compared to using 3rd party feedstock processors to deliver it in the 2\" format) which utilizes sound bombardment to pulverize the feedstock into a fine 50 to 100 micron powder (about the consistency of flour). That powder is then mixed with the used motor oil, to make it a slurry (it's much easier to heat up a slurry-type liquid than heat up a solid feedstock). The slurry then goes through the patented Thermo-Catalytic-Depulmerization process to convert into distillate, which then goes through a separation process to separate into diesel, kerosene and naphtha. So they won't really \"drop the feedstock off at the gates\" per se, but it will end up being processed into the manageable feedstock, to them be delivered to the facility where it is kept in a designated storage area, waiting to be converted into the powder, to then make it's way into the facility and through the process. I am definitely NOT the tech guy in this equation, so I may be over-simplifying it a bit. I've been through enough plant tours with Don and Mark to have a pretty good idea of that whole process, but will never profess to be an expert! I hope that answers your question.\n\ntypically I wouldn't see them \"mixing\" feedstocks at random, as there may be issues with specific contaminants, etc, but yes that would be possible. When we are using feedstocks that don't have much for nasty contaminants in it, we are analyzing some of the ash waste for potential fertilizer applications as a bonus revenue source, so if we can ensure that certain type of feedstock produce a \"useable\" waste, as opposed to landfilling them or putting down disposal wells, then we will want to ensure we are taking advantage of that by not mixing that feedstock with others that prevent that.\"\n\n\\-\n\nCMC has recently seen a share price spike in the last few weeks. I believe this is partially due to Bob McWhirter from BNN recommending the company in a National Post article. Anand Varun also mentioned them on BNN Market Call.\n\nFor anyone looking for more info on CMC, here's a few videos of their CEO going over their process and some investor materials.\n\nProcess explanation and facility walkthrough - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m44VPAjkwCA&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m44VPAjkwCA&amp;t=2s)\n\nCEO Interview - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMYsasotbgo&amp;feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMYsasotbgo&amp;feature=emb_logo)\n\nInvestor Materials - [https://www.cielows.com/investor-materials/](https://www.cielows.com/investor-materials/)\n\nIn conclusion, I think CMC is undervalued right now and will be on a lot of people's radar in the not too distant future. Part of me loves the play because I'm very confident I'll make good money from it. The other part of me loves the play because these guys are going to eliminate millions of tonnes of garbage within a few years and way more as time goes on. They'll turn that trash into renewable diesel, which would otherwise be decomposing in a landfill somewhere releasing greenhouse gases and polluting the local environment.\n\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading. Let me know what you think below.\n\nAll the best,\n\nKyle",

This isn\u2019t my usual kind of post, but man, I can\u2019t stand to see how people just follow every freaking YouTuber out there blindly!** In this post, we are going to talk about why I believe Tom Nash may be a **fraud**, so please do have some patience and read the full post, as I will go through an in-depth research of his past and his claims.\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nLet\u2019s start by talking about who Tom Nash is &amp; says he is. He is a new &amp; trendy \u201cfinance &amp; stock market\u201d YouTuber which has recently passed 150K subscribers after exploding during this retail investor boom, but here is a short [video](https://imgur.com/yuNMUlv) from his YouTube describing himself.\n\nIn the video he is claiming he is a former \u201csenior financial analyst\u201d which is very hard to believe in my opinion after doing a lot of research about him.\n\nSo let\u2019s go through the **5 reasons**\ud83d\udca9 I believe he is lying about his past &amp; why you should never take anything any YouTuber out there says for granted and you should do your own research as well:\n\n**1)  Let\u2019s start with the biggest one, his valuation methods are flawed \u274c**\n\nEven though he has posted some videos that have panned out, it\u2019s very hard to differentiate good analysis from pure luck in this recent bull market, even monkeys could throw darts at stocks in the past 11 months and be right after the March sell-off.\n\nI was pretty curious of his valuation methods so I joined his channel membership and asked him a direct question, about his DCF valuation, to which he [responded](https://imgur.com/Zdtm2dI) bluntly that I am doing things wrong. I also sent him a direct link to a well-known financial institute, where we can see that the most common cash flow used for financial [modeling](https://imgur.com/MSJgiSk), which is the unlevered free cash flow, implies that you subtract any capital expenditures of the company, which contradicts the way he sees it and is plain wrong, it\u2019s like he uses 2nd grade math, if you subtract a negative number then your cash flow actually increases, which doesn\u2019t even make sense. How can something that costs you money be a positive on the free cash flow?\n\nI\u2019ll let you digest this as I will next show you some of his DCF valuations &amp; how he uses absurd numbers and changes the formulas as he pleases just to reach some insane valuations for companies just to be catchy.\n\nHere are a couple of short extracts from his Salesforce DCF calculations,\n\n[**Exibit A**](https://streamable.com/vu2agx) \\- everything seems legit until here, now he starts with the biggest mistake in this DCF\n\n[**Exibit B**](https://imgur.com/BWeAZw8) \\- I\u2019ll be blunt you can never, ever add the Capex number to a DCF valuation, that literally throws the hole calculations off, but let\u2019s continue\u2026\n\n[**Exibit C**](https://imgur.com/LgHKupD) \\- So, using a discount rate of 6% is also insane, even with the current low interest rates, you should at least discount the average [SP500](https://imgur.com/YTxt90T) return, or use the WACC or any other type of metric, which is much safer than picking out a single company, as the SP500 has proven over long-stretches to be a great performer.\n\nBut yeah guys, this isn\u2019t the first time he has done these kind of errors, you can see he is using most of these methods in many stock picks which are then spread out to thousands of new investors, who don\u2019t really have the knowledge to test what he is saying. I\u2019m just showing you here a couple of stocks like [Dynatrace](https://imgur.com/hAO37u8), [Opendoor](https://imgur.com/66rMYZe), [Alibaba](https://imgur.com/ikLetLL), [Peloton](https://imgur.com/WRoLdIL), [Salesforce](https://imgur.com/D9Ky3gl) as I showed in the previous video and even [Apple](https://imgur.com/g8k7ZxA) that have been analyzed and spread to the public this way.\n\nThe other big issue with his valuations is that he is using insane long-term growth rates, as he used a 5% growth rate for [Peloton](https://imgur.com/EV2WB9Y) to reach a higher valuation, so can you imagine? If Peloton grows at a 5% rate in perpetuity it means they should more than double the inflation [rate](https://imgur.com/xaN3Dxw) every year and is way higher than any GDP [growth](https://imgur.com/Jkk01c9) the US has seen since 1984.\n\nHe is also [implying](https://imgur.com/Wkd2AV8) that Peloton has no debt on it\u2019s balance sheet, which is 100% false, as you can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/rsB0fJg), he used the cash, cash equivalents &amp; marketable securities to calculate the short term assets while completely ignoring the over $700M in accounts payable no to mention the other current liabilities which would add up to almost exactly the $1.4B in assets he added to his calculations.\n\nBut who knows guys? Maybe he is the real deal, as he has made some [correct](https://imgur.com/v3ZYhSU) DCF implications for some stocks like [Fortinet](https://imgur.com/kCTo7jC) and [FuboTV](https://imgur.com/vojljFt), by actually subtracting the Capex finally, though he doesn\u2019t do this in every analysis, not even in the most recent ones while also keeping that big long-term growth rate at 5%, when I myself never use a bigger one than 4%.\n\nJust for an [example](https://imgur.com/tnWSWVa) I took his CRM numbers and popped them up in my spreadsheets, and even given his methods I couldn\u2019t quite get to the same results without manually editing numbers, as those implications resulted in a 7% undervaluation for the stock, while only adjusting the Capex to be a negative on the cashflows and not touching anything else that might be wrong in this DCF, [resulted](https://imgur.com/5vxgKqI) in a 10% overvaluation for the stock.\n\nSo, I think if he really was a 10+ years wall street analyst I don\u2019t think he could have made these obvious mistakes.\n\n**2) So, Is Tom Nash whom he says he is or is he lying about his past? \u274c**\n\n[HERE](https://imgur.com/wbJ8Csh) is the channel intro for his YouTube (Which I can't even see anymore, but i was lucky to download it a couple of days ago)\n\nAs you Can see, I don\u2019t doubt that he actually went to Michigan or that he got and MBA, but I do doubt that all of his Successful \u201cSenior\u201d Financial analyst &amp; consulting Career can be described with only a couple of weak-ass photos of him at an NBA game, or him casually at some kind of a course program as that is exactly what it looks like with the other guys in the back-left of the photo.\n\nAlso, are we to believe all of this great financial career ended with him just taking out his fake plant from his office, while also smiling as he threw away at least a decent salary for a gamble on YouTube, which is very hard to do, especially when you are starting, as YouTube doesn\u2019t really help the small guys.\n\nHis YouTube journey seemed to have [started](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) on the path of exposing guru\u2019s and not financial advice, as he also says in the video, so how did he turn to do financial analysis on YouTube? Seems pretty convenient that he just became an expert in stock analysis as YouTube videos on such things were booming.\n\nYou can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/Vq4ov7x), he didn\u2019t make a single stock analysis for the most part of 2020, which seems pretty off, as now most of his videos are on stock analysis, and while his channel was created in 2017, he conveniently deleted all the previous videos, which is another weird move to do.\n\nI also went on a deep internet dive and did a lot of searching about him and I found this video [podcast](https://imgur.com/09mBKRU) of him.\n\nHis main intro in this podcast is that he works as a consultant indeed, from Israel, and also the consultancy job isn\u2019t for a financial company, it\u2019s rather to help people on YouTube grow, so let's look at some extracts from the video:\n\n[**Exibit I**](https://streamable.com/xrbv3o) \\- We can see the main part of the talk is nothing about anything related to his financial past, let\u2019s continue\n\n[**Exibit II**](https://imgur.com/Ziftnpi) \\- It seems he started with a gaming channel, not even a fake guru channel, and I also found something about that FB [GROUP](https://imgur.com/Xdt4H1i) which isn\u2019t active anymore and all of the videos he made for that have also been deleted as you can see in this [post](https://imgur.com/FyKSrIq) from way back in 2018 as he was [teaching](https://imgur.com/T5lbbH2) how to make money on YouTube well through 2019, and was even giving out free workshop [experiences](https://imgur.com/K89Yk3S)  as he was pumping out creator [content](https://imgur.com/z196rMB) which is miles apart from financial analysis (BTW, he is using the same freaking photo in his old banner &amp; logo as his current one, just changing the green screen background), just look at [his](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) old YouTube banner (YouTube tips &amp; tutorials)\n\n[**Exibit III**](https://imgur.com/kZddAl3) \\- Yeah, it seems he also did some video on how to promote on Reddit, and what comes next guys is literally mind blowing, how much more can this dude lie &amp; hide?\n\n[**Exibit IV**](https://streamable.com/ji6ne2) \\-  Well\u2026 Nothing to hide then\u2026 He even had a Fiverr account which was called tomernash you can see clearly [HERE](https://imgur.com/topDW52), that is his username, and when I went out to check it out right now, he is [using](https://imgur.com/HVqNkwv) a fake picture &amp; and still might live in Israel, not the US, and on top of this he might not actually even be from Russia, which he has been saying over &amp; over again on his channel. You can [SEE](https://imgur.com/18Yiimf) he reiterates he is a certified YouTube consultant with no mention of his financial skills or certifications.\n\nAnd even more, you see what picture he uses as a logo yeah? Well, I did a reverse google search and found the other guy also has a YouTube [channel](https://imgur.com/DWpofDb) about kinetic cycling.\n\nMaybe he was one of his clients that he reached a deal to use his picture, wtf, the more I dig in the more I am amazed of the lengths this man has gone to reach fame on YouTube.\n\n[**Exibit V**](https://streamable.com/sdtd7d) \\- So\u2026 A financial analyst with no sheets, no paper, no nothing, great stuff for a senior financial analyst, I literally can\u2019t take more of this so let\u2019s move to the next reasons\n\n**3) Getting in front of the lie? \u274c**\n\nI believe that\u2019s what he was trying to do to, by making a [VIDEO](https://imgur.com/CeH7ePh) on this very subject in mid-2020 and popping up higher in the search rankings before his channel boomed.\n\nIn the video he clarifies that Tom Nash isn\u2019t his real name, but he also restated that he was working for a big consultancy firm as recent as this summer, and that he does shit tons of stuff which is very hard to believe, as usually this big consultancy firms have different departments for different things that he mentioned in the video. You can still find that video on his channel if you are interested\n\nBut, by the way, how was he working on that job while also doing hundreds of Fiverr jobs as a YouTube consultant?\n\nHe also claims to not offering any courses, e-books or other stuff like this, which is false as i showed in the previous reasons with his past YouTube courses &amp; other stuff, and as you will see in the next reasons, something smells really bad out here.\n\n**4) Claims about his past \u274c**\n\nI also took a deeper dive into more of his past, as you can see in [his](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) previous channel cover and info, he had only about 4K subscribers as he was doing guru video reviews on YouTube, but all of a sudden, he [became](https://imgur.com/r6X2yHg) a senior financial analyst from wall street that was living in Israel &amp; doing Fiverr gigs, I don\u2019t know what to say but it seems pretty fishy to me.\n\nI also checked his LinkedIn [page](https://imgur.com/Xpbq7Im), and all of his skills &amp; endorsements seem to be related to his YouTube skills and nothing about finance or the stock market.\n\nBut I also found his [profile](https://imgur.com/9FxHnCb) on Quora, where he wasn\u2019t that active but still, well back in [2017](https://imgur.com/EUPer8h) he was posting things about gaming &amp; YouTube while supposedly still working on Wall Street as a financial analyst, and it\u2019s interesting that there is no [mention](https://imgur.com/kcpxh2X) of him following anything related to stocks, finance, economy, accounting, statistics or anything other related to the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I guess when you make a new type of video and it boosts your channel from just [10K](https://imgur.com/GEvQ7yB) subscribers all the way up to [150K](https://imgur.com/3F0D4rI) subscribers, you are willing to push the limits and lie about your past just to keep everything going, as YouTube is a really good way to make money right now.\n\n**5) The Transformation \u274c**\n\nHe has had even more channels in the past not only this one, which he has transformed overnight from a YouTube Channel [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/JUnuYDE) to a Guru [Reviewer](https://imgur.com/ECzNGcE) and finally to a financial [analyst](https://imgur.com/oCIBljZ) , as He created a second &amp; third YouTube account called [GearlyReviews](https://imgur.com/9vAPlu3) where he reviews electronics and [EuroBall](https://imgur.com/G130Wgr) where he only posted 2 videos.\n\nI also searched him through his Reddit [posts](https://imgur.com/zmsRhbB) and only could find things related to marketing &amp; social media, nothing about finance yet again.\n\n# So, my personal opinion which I doubt to be wrong guys, if there is a case of a dubious &amp; fishy person out there, he is one of them!\n\nI believe that he has never worked as a senior financial analyst and especially not a stock market, asset or any other type of equity analyst.\n\nMost of his stock [picks](https://imgur.com/uOgFNkQ) are small-caps that are highly volatile or a couple of recent high flyers which are very catchy to any YouTube audience.\n\nThere are many things wrong about the picture he has painted about himself even though he has gone through a lot to try and erase his past. The fact that there are no mentions of things from the wall street or consulting firm, bad stock analysis and methods, fishy and dubious moves of his YouTube channels and especially fishy things about him being a consultant &amp; analyst in early 2020 while he was already doing YouTube and other stuff back in 2017-2018 really makes me not want to buy his story.\n\nFolks, be careful out there, you can find a lot of YouTubers out there who make more money from their advice giving on YouTube, Patreon or other kind of subscriptions and courses, compared to the actual money they are making or have ever made in the stock market.\n\nSo yeah guys, I don\u2019t want to make a final judgment on this guy, but you should consider everything I have showed about him and all the problems with his past &amp; his financial methods &amp; just remember as always **in a bull market everyone is an expert &amp; genius**, while in a bear market you can\u2019t find any of these people as they all flee.\n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.  \u201cDoubling your money or more in as little as two weeks\u201d is not a legal guarantee or other certainty.  Past performance is not indicative of future performance.*\n\n*Because of the u/AutoModerator, the original thread used a banned word or two, including in the title itself.  This is the cleaned-up version.*\n\n**OVERVIEW**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/ixjhuz/are_we_in_a_spac_bubble/g67cgse/\n\nThere are at least four ways to play SPACs, each corresponding to a SPAC's lifecycle.\n\nThe first play is arbitrage.  This comes and goes, depending on the stock price of a SPAC unit.\n\nThe second play is NAV, which has been posted about by other SPAC denizens.  Again, this comes and goes.  One risk here is that rising bond yields could lower the NAVs of SPACs without targets.\n\nThe third play is the deadline calendar.  If we see an excess of SPACs, we could see more and more bad deals.  The \"SPAC bubble\" is mainly in play here.\n\nThe fourth and final play applies only to select SPACs.\n\n**BLOCKBUSTER EVENTS**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/spacstreetbets/comments/jf5jy6/a_way_around_spac_saturation_event_spacs/gcgxany/\n\nThere are lots of SPACs around these days. There are legitimate concerns about saturation.\n\nAll reverse mergers / special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) are not created equal.  Most don't have hype.\n\nEven among those that have hype, there are the regular ones, and then there are SPACs that present more clearly the way around SPAC saturation.\n\nThese latter SPACs are the event SPACs, or blockbuster SPACs.\n\nWelcome to the *real* money-making opportunity in SPAC Land!  These blockbuster events are characterized by most of the price movements below, some more fundamental than others.\n\n**(#1) LETTER-OF-INTENT (LOI) POP**\n\nA letter of intent announcement, or an official rumor, is the lesser of two early announcements.\n\nHype-based price movement in reaction to this, Price Movement #1, is not necessary for a blockbuster event to unfold.  Also, even if this were to happen, a SPAC can be like SPAQ and not become a money-making blockbuster event.\n\nGRAF / VLDR still holds the record for the highest pop.\n\n**(#2) DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT (DA) AND THE SPIKE**\n\nCertain hype SPACs can spike to at least $20, and their warrants by greater percentages.  Should they do so, they could become money-making blockbuster events.  Without spikes this high, this Price Movement #2, they will end up like regular hype SPACs such as LCA and OPES.\n\nSHLL / HYLN still holds the record for the highest spike.\n\n**(#3) ALTERNATIVE: BELATED UPWARD MOMENTUM**\n\nIf certain hype SPACs don't \"spike\" hard immediately, they can still have steady upward momentum that breaks $15 and stays there for the six weeks following their DA announcements.  While this alternative price movement, Price Movement #3, is mutually exclusive to Price Movement #2, it could indicate a blockbuster event in the making.  Similar movement must be found on the warrants side.\n\nDPHC / RIDE is the first blockbuster SPAC to have had this belated momentum.\n\n**(#4) LONG BLEED**\n\nReece Haslam posted a video on YouTube titled [The Best SPAC Investing Strategy! - Applies To All Highly Anticipated SPACs!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE55BzRqg-U&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nThose who miss Price Movement #2 should not FOMO into a SPAC, hoping it will keep going.  The next price movement, Price Movement #4, is the long bleed downward.\n\n**(#5) DOUBLE YOUR MONEY OR MORE: \"IPO POP\" OR PRE-MERGER RAMP-UP**\n\nThe fourth way to play SPACs presents this realistic opportunity: **Double your money or more in as little as two weeks!**\n\nWhat is this opportunity?\n\nWhy, it's none other than the pre-merger ramp-up to $30, $40, or more - and greater percentage gains with warrants and options.  As the Washington Post commented on SHLL before HYLN, \"[this is the SPAC equivalent of the first-day IPO 'pop' that critics dislike](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/a-28-year-oldbillionaire-wins-the-spaclottery/2020/09/28/f64b0b58-017b-11eb-b92e-029676f9ebec_story.html).\"\n\nConsider [this individual experience](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-revenue-no-problem-wall-street-rushes-into-electric-car-and-truck-startups-11603286077):\n\n&gt; [Blake Denton] learned about Hyliion, which plans to mass produce electric drivetrains for semi-trucks, while looking through posts on the online message board Reddit. The company announced a deal to go public in June by merging with a [SPAC] and buzz began to grow online, with some thinking it could be the next Nikola.\n\n&gt; \u201cI had invested in Hyliion on pure hype\u2014literally pure hype,\u201d Mr. Denton said. \u201cI knew nothing about the company.\u201d\n\n&gt; He said he sold after the price went up and made about $50,000.\n\nThis doubling or more of our money in as little as two weeks, this \"IPO pop,\" is the key differentiator between blockbuster SPACs, on the one hand, and regular hype SPACs, second-tier SPACs, and garbage SPACs, on the other.  This is the key differentiator between an excellent-to-near perfect SPAC management team and a lower-quality one!\n\nHow can this opportunity be made possible?\n\nPrice Movement #2 or Price Movement #3 has been a prerequisite for every blockbuster SPAC's pre-merger ramp-up, or Price Movement #5, since SHLL / HYLN.  VTIQ / NKLA has been the sole exception so far.\n\nAny relevant SEC filing has also been a prerequisite.  More importantly, there have been no exceptions.\n\nWhich SPACs have been official blockbuster events to date?  These have been the official blockbuster events to date:\n\nVTIQ / NKLA\n\nSHLL / HYLN\n\nGRAF / VLDR\n\nDPHC / RIDE\n\nSBE / CHPT\n\nSTPK / STEM\n\nNGA / LEV\n\nKCAC / QS has also been an official blockbuster event, which will be explained later.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nThe \"SPAC bubble\" is not in play here for blockbuster SPACs, but broader market bubbles are.  The relevant bubble is the \"future tech\" bubble inclusive of sustainability, within which EV belongs, and digitization.  2023 is the earliest that the Fed could raise the overnight lending rate.  This could adversely affect such bubbles, most notably the \"future tech\" one.\n\nAs for risks specific to definitive agreements, all its takes is a merger breakdown to collapse the pre-merger ramp-up of a blockbuster SPAC to collapse, which would then scare away retail players with the most money.  [The SPAC community actually caught a glimpse of this in none other than SHLL / HYLN, the very blockbuster SPAC with the best pre-merger ramp-up to date!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/j1dilj/explanation_why_proposal_3_didnt_pass_for_shll/)\n\n**(#6) EXCEPTIONAL PRICE MOVEMENT: IMMEDIATE POST-MERGER HYPE AND CRASH**\n\nThere can be one more upward price movement following the pre-merger ramp-up.  After the merger and ticker change, there is the possibility of an immediate post-merger hype and crash.  VTIQ / NKLA is the blockbuster SPAC noted for this special price movement.\n\nKCAC / QS has been an official blockbuster event despite the absence of a pre-merger ramp-up, as it has exhibited both an earlier spike and this immediate post-merger hype and crash.\n\n**THEN COMES THE DROP**\n\nEven with an immediate post-merger hype and crash, Special Price Movement #6, the final drop must come.  [As Jim Cramer noted on Mad Money about SHLL / HYLN, \"then they pull back hard.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ha9WoUEE3c)\n\nThis part is self-explanatory, and there are multiple reasons for this.\n\nAnyways, lots of money can be made in these blockbuster SPACs, both long and short.",

        "selftext": "**Who are HeliumOne?**\n\nHeliumOne is listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM:HE1) and is currently trading at around \u00a30.08.\u00a0\n\nHeliumOne is an exploration company who own multiple areas of land in Tanzania, the biggest believed to have the potential to hold the world's largest primary source of Helium.\n\n**Helium Market:**\n\nHelium isn\u2019t just used a balloon filler and its use is expected to only increase:\n\n* Helium is known as a super-cooler and is used to cool superconductors - an industry expected to grow massively in the next decade.\n* Helium is used in many high tech applications such as MRI Scanners and Cryogenics. (20% of all Helium is used in the manufacture and use of MRI Scanners)\n* Helium is used to pressurise and stiffen rocket tanks - another growth industry.\n* Helium is used in Heliox mixtures in respiratory medicine for people with Asthma and Bronchitis.\n\nThe Helium market was valued at $10.6 billion in 2019, expecting to grow 11% to $15.73 billion by 2023.\n\nHowever, there is one small issue with this ever-growing demand for Helium, **SUPPLY IS RUNNING OUT**.\n\n**The global supply of Helium is running out:**\n\nHelium is actually a finite resource meaning when it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone. Not only this, we have found no way to manufacture or synthesise Helium. At current rates of supply and demand some scientists believe we may run out in as soon as 10 years. Not only this, current the global supply of Helium only comes as a by-product of hydrocarbon production. With the global shift to renewable energy, inevitably oil and gas fields will eventually shut, again reducing the supply of helium.\n\nGlobal demand of helium is estimated to be 6 billion cubic feet per annum with the unit price per thousand cubic feet has risen 135% in the past two years.\u00a0\n\nOn top of this, there seems to not be any perfect replacements for Helium due to its long list of desirable properties:\n\n* Inert.\n* Lighter than air/low density (preferred over hydrogen due to being inflammable).\n* High diffusion rate - used to test for leaks in machinery.\n* Very low boiling point - used to give metals superconductivity.\n* High thermal conductivity.\n\n**How can HeliumOne solve this crisis?:**\n\nIn 2016 when the University of Oxford and the University of Durham couldn\u2019t continue with their research due to an ongoing Helium crisis, they set about trying to scour the globe for where they believed Helium would be abundant.\n\nWhat they found was the Tanzanian East African Rift Valley. They then partnered with HeliumOne who went to the valley and brought back samples confirming the presence of Helium at the surface.\n\nOxford and Durham then stepped to the side and HeliumOne continued exploration of the grounds. HeliumOne set up three projects, one in Rukwa, Eyasi and Balandiga. I will be focussing on the Rukwa project as that is currently most developed and by far the largest.\n\nThe Rukwa area is 3,590km2 and the company holds 15 prospecting licenses in this area. From measurements of surface seepage, aerial gravity surveys and the studying of 1,100 line kilometres of re-processed seismic data, this area has been independently verified as the \u2018largest known primary resource of Helium in the world\u2019 due to a best estimate un risked prospective recoverable Helium resource of 138 billion cubic feet.\u00a0\n\nThis means that if this Helium is found to be there once drilled, **HeliumOne would have enough Helium to supply the market 20-100 years** depending on global consumption. As CEO David Minchin said, this would be globally strategic, a price maker and not a price taker.\n\n**Ok how do HeliumOne extract this Helium?:**\n\n* In Q1 2021, Helium One are currently gathering 150 more kilometres of seismic data to infill any gaps in their data.\n* In Q2 2021, Helium is beginning to start their drilling to test for the Helium. They are planning to drill one hole in April, one in May and one in June. If just one of these holes confirms the presence of Helium then HeliumOne will have enough confidence to begin engineering planning and feasibility studies.\n* In Q3/Q4 they plan to begin feasibility planning and field evaluation of the project - Obviously if the first 3 drill holes come back negative, this will be delayed while they test more sites.\n* 2022/2023 they have planned for construction of their plants ready for Helium production.\n\n**Benefits of HeliumOne and Helium:**\n\n* If they confirm the presence of Helium in their land they should have the confidence to declare they have the largest known primary resource of Helium in the world. With this amount of Helium they could control the prices of Helium by deciding how much they want to produce.\n* The grade of Helium they\u2019ve found is greater than anywhere else on the market, 10% hydrogen, 90% nitrogen. Current grades of Helium gathered from hydrocarbons is &gt; 1%.\n* They don't have to do anything with the nitrogen left over, it can just be vented to the atmosphere with no adverse effects.\n* Even if the concentrations of Hydrogen are not as great as the surface seeps show, even a far lower concentration is economically viable to gather and sell.\n* Construction of the processing plant is a lot simpler and cheaper than Oil and Gas plants. They believe they will need an extra $50mn to build their first plant, compared to hundreds of millions/billions needed to create an oil/gas plant.\n* Very experienced management team. All of them are experienced in the field of mineral exploration and have all contributed to the success of companies.\n* Tanzania has many exploration/mining companies already operating within its borders which increases the confidence in HeliumOne that the Tanzanian government wouldn\u2019t push them out/revoke licenses.\n* They have recently renewed all their prospector licenses in late 2020 with extensions of 3 years with options to extend an extra 2 years.\n* They are fully funded for the exploration portion of the project.\n* Low debt (Under \u00a3500k)\n* Risked NAV of \u00a30.11/share from analysts Hannam and Partners.\n* Un-Risked NAV of \u00a31.04/share.\n* Rukwa site is only 100km away from Dar Es Salaam and only 30km away from the main highway to Dar es Salaam.\n* Very early on in the life of the company, only IPO\u2019d in December.\n* High news flow/developments through 2021.\n* The next source of Helium after Earth's supply is depleted is in space. We're still quite a way off of  that.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n* HeliumOne could find that all the theory of seismic data and surface seeps may have all been misleading and when they drill they may not hit Helium\n* HeliumOne may find Helium however the geology of the valley may mean that it isn\u2019t trapped well in the ground, which would make it hard to capture and drill. However, they have confidence the geology is fine due to comparisons between this valley and similar ones elsewhere.\n* Investor impatience in the case of any set-backs to the schedule.\n* Dilution to fund the capital to start production (No mention of this but is a possibility).\n* Gazprom also has a large helium field however it is still dwarfed by the potential size of HeliumOne\u2019s.\u00a0\n* Very early on in the life of the company, only IPO\u2019d in December. There could be a lot of delays and things that go wrong.\n* I believe that some uses of Helium re-circulate it once used. Especially in cryogenics, reducing demand.\n\n**Summary/TLDR:**\n\n**HeliumOne are in a unique position of being on the edge of owning a high value, in demand asset in huge amounts. Risks are that all the top geologists, universities, current data they've collected, two independent verifications could be wrong.** \n\n**More Info:**\n\n\\- Definite read (short length) - [http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/](http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/) \\- January 2021 investor presentation.\n\n\\- Watch for even more info (40mins) - [https://youtu.be/ZhGrrxAi5qE](https://youtu.be/ZhGrrxAi5qE) \\- Crux Investor interview with CEO David Minchin.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Helium - Chemical Economics Handbook (CEH) | IHS Markitihsmarkit.com \u203a products \u203a helium-chemical-economics-h\u2026](https://ihsmarkit.com/products/helium-chemical-economics-handbook.html) \\- MRI Helium stats\n* [https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/helium-global-market-report](https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/helium-global-market-report)) - Helium Market stats and Growth.\n* [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/helium-supply-world-shortage-run-out-recycle-mri-scanners-deep-sea-diving-balloons-a8741081.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/helium-supply-world-shortage-run-out-recycle-mri-scanners-deep-sea-diving-balloons-a8741081.html)) - Analysts Estimates for helium running out.\u00a0\n* ([http://www.helium-one.com/helium-market/](http://www.helium-one.com/helium-market/)) - Price rise of helium.\n* ([https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-06-28-huge-helium-discovery-life-saving-find](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-06-28-huge-helium-discovery-life-saving-find)) - Oxford University\u2019s discovery of the valley.\n* ([http://www.helium-one.com/rukwa/](http://www.helium-one.com/rukwa/)) - Helium estimates for the Rukwa valley site.\n* ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhGrrxAi5qE&amp;feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhGrrxAi5qE&amp;feature=emb_logo)) - \u201cPrice maker, not a price taker\u201d quote.\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhGrrxAi5qE&amp;feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhGrrxAi5qE&amp;feature=emb_logo) \\- Helium grades.\n* [http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/](http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/) \\- Helium One road map.\n* [http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/](http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/) \\- Cost of $50mn for processing plant.\n* [http://www.helium-one.com/board-of-directors/](http://www.helium-one.com/board-of-directors/) \\- Management experience.\n* [http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/](http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/)\u00a0 \\- Benefits/Lack of risk in Tanzania.\n* [https://mcusercontent.com/110d0aa5f5d9bf9478796664e/files/58194820-d910-4c75-b085-a151b97344ee/Helium\\_One\\_Initiation\\_note\\_Final\\_14\\_Dec\\_2020\\_RB2.pdf?utm\\_source=H%26P+Master+Contact+List+%28Sements+and+Tags%29&amp;utm\\_campaign=78f95cbff0-EMAIL\\_CAMPAIGN\\_2019\\_05\\_20\\_02\\_05\\_COPY\\_01&amp;utm\\_medium=email&amp;utm\\_term=0\\_dd4f91613c-78f95cbff0-371771967](https://mcusercontent.com/110d0aa5f5d9bf9478796664e/files/58194820-d910-4c75-b085-a151b97344ee/Helium_One_Initiation_note_Final_14_Dec_2020_RB2.pdf?utm_source=H%26P+Master+Contact+List+%28Sements+and+Tags%29&amp;utm_campaign=78f95cbff0-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_05_20_02_05_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_dd4f91613c-78f95cbff0-371771967) \\- Analyst Report of HE1, provides debt, risked and unrisked NAV.\n* [http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/](http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/)\u00a0 \\- distance from Dar es Salaam.\n* [http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/](http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/) \\- Gazprom\u2019s Helium site.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh yeah, He1 to the moon!",

        "selftext": "1 Transportation and Delivery\n\nTransportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won\u2019t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . \n\nLooking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP\n\n======\n\n2 More traditional/\u201d big players\u201d financial stocks\n\nI have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:\n\nFintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I\u2019ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of \"recover\" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.\n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.\n\nLooking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM\n\n======\n\n3 Military and Defense\n\nThe mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won\u2019t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).\n\nLooking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)\n\n======\n\n4 Tech Infrastructures\n\nWith everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.\n\nLooking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC\n\n======\n\n5 Virtual Currency\n\nI am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don\u2019t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks. \n\nLooking at: BLOK, KOIN",

        "selftext": "Today $GHSI closed above a dollar making it the 2nd day of compliance.\n\nIt hit a high of 1.19 before the SPY drive by took us down to 1.02. It has consolidated nicely and found support at 1.10.   Resistance is currently at 1.20 as it tried to pass it in PM and at opening. Overall, this has been the same pattern over the last week higher highs and higher lows. Notice that is is performing well while still trading at it's average volume. This stock has not been found yet.\n\nI am extremely bullish with new leadership. Upon doing further DD the new CEO bought 1 million shares in January. He has confidence that this company can grow and I trust that he has the wherewithal to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Below is the DD shared from the previous post:**\n\n$GHSI has until March 15th to regain compliance. Share holders have already approved the [r/s](https://www.reddit.com/r/s/) so if it doesn't reach compliance it will [r/S](https://www.reddit.com/r/S/). However, I do not think that will be the outcome.\n\nIt is my opinion that $GHSI can see continuation in the coming days to regain compliance.\n\nThe California company develops medical foods and devices for ocular (eye) health, as well as \u201cnutraceutical\u201d food products for consumer health.\n\nThe company just did a private offering to an investor on January 15th which raised $9.5 million according to January 28th SEC filing so there is not likely an offering coming especially with compliance looming. This is always something I consider when deciding whether I want to trade a stock.\n\nOn January 28, 2021 it was announced that \"GHSI Has received Regulatory Product Registration Approval from the Malaysia Government for Second Immune Support Dietary Supplement Designed and Produced by GHSI\" so now instead of one approved supplement being sold in the Asian market, GHSI will package both the Nutra V and Astra H products together to provide a more complete immune support product offering to its customers. Malaysia has entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement for Guardion to design and manufacture both immune support dietary supplements, which are to be packaged together for sale by HWGB in Malaysia. HWGB\u2019s healthcare subsidiary, Astramern Sdn Bhd, has an exclusive license to use and distribute these products in the Asian and other foreign areas. The new approval is in effect immediately and orders requests will follow giving GHSI a boost in revenue.\n\nBeyond the incoming revenue stream the biggest news is the hiring of the new CEO Bret Scholtes in late December . Bret Scholtes is a proven nutritional products industry leader.\n\nBret spent the last 9 years as CEO Omega Protein Corporation (\u201cOmega\u201d), a global nutritional products company which traded on the New York Stock Exchange until it was successfully sold to a strategic buyer in late 2017. Omega operated branded and private label ingredient businesses with more than 1,100 employees. During his time at Omega, annualized revenues increased by 55%, EBITDA grew by more than 70%, and Omega\u2019s stock price increased by approximately 260%. In addition, Mr. Scholtes spearheaded the acquisition of four companies, which added approximately $125 million to revenues through complementary product lines, introduced more than 40 new products, and expanded successfully into several new markets.\n\nThe addition of Bret Scholtes is what makes me bullish for the long term of this company. As a savy CEO it would not surprise me if a PR drops to make sure they meet compliance.\n\n\\*Disclosure: This is not financial advice nor am I a financial advisor, I own shares in this stock at an average of $.98\n\n**DD works cited:**\n\n[https://investorplace.com/2021/01/ghsi-stock-11-things-for-investors-to-know-about-guardion-health-sciences/](https://investorplace.com/2021/01/ghsi-stock-11-things-for-investors-to-know-about-guardion-health-sciences/) (more background)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-01-28/malaysia-s-ho-wah-genting-berhad-advises-guardion-health-sciences-that-it-has-received-regulatory-product-registration](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-01-28/malaysia-s-ho-wah-genting-berhad-advises-guardion-health-sciences-that-it-has-received-regulatory-product-registration) (product registration)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-01-27/nasdaq-grants-guardion-health-sciences-an-extension-to-march-15-2021-to-regain-compliance-with-the-1-00-minimum-bid-price](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-01-27/nasdaq-grants-guardion-health-sciences-an-extension-to-march-15-2021-to-regain-compliance-with-the-1-00-minimum-bid-price) (compliance extension)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-12-28/guardion-health-sciences-appoints-seasoned-nutritional-products-industry-leader-bret-scholtes-as-president-and-chief-executive](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-12-28/guardion-health-sciences-appoints-seasoned-nutritional-products-industry-leader-bret-scholtes-as-president-and-chief-executive)( New CEO)",

        "selftext": "Market is not paying attention to recurring revenue potential of Covid-19 vaccines. Given the scare of pandemic and [increasing mutations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/world-s-most-vaccinated-nation-struggles-with-new-virus-variants), for next few years, everyone will likely be forced to take [annual jab](https://www.ft.com/content/26b256d0-d021-46ac-ae3d-e3ea823c033d) (or at the very least travellers should need vaccination proof for quite sometime)\n\nWhen it comes to next jab, most people are likely to go for Novavax because:\n\n1. [Much lower side effects as compared to Moderna/Pfizer](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/COVID-19_VX_12222020_F.pdf?v=tY2fmi5jaTcPs6s4xSzi_QUhEV8v0ayLLWYwd-p1upM)\n2.

To reach $71B, NVAX shares will need to shoot to **$1116**\n\nIt can be argued that lower price than Moderna means lower revenue.

        "selftext": "Sending out much love to all of you here at the r/wallstreetbets community! &lt;3 Whether you are completely new to this subreddit community, or have been an old timer (like myself). I'm coming up on 8 years of being apart of this subreddit this year. It's been a pretty *interesting* couple of years for me to say the least. :P\n\nI remember when j/artek first introduced me to this subreddit, back in late 2013 I thnk it was. It was really a whole new experience for me. And then to actually be invited as part of the mod team here a year or so later, which I'm embarrassed to admit I had declined for personal reasons. Regretting that decision bigly, even to this day believe it or not. * facepalm *\n\nBut anyway, I thought it was quite fitting for V-day to be on this day here today. Because, I do genuinely feel like this entire subreddit community is my valentine. I know these past couple of weeks have a bit a hard on this community. And I feel you guys!\n\nI know there are quite a ton of you out there who would like to see the sub righted back to the good 'ole days of WSB, which I largely remember the most of this subreddit community honestly. Been trying hard to get some of my own content posting in here regularly again, like the most anticipated weekly earnings whispers threads (speaking of which -- I have quite a bit of interesting stats to share with you all [on that thread from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj0slc/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/)!), or my [weekly wall street week ahead thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj2irq/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/) which i know a lot of you really enjoy reading on the weekends, albeit tedious af to put together since i literally setup those threads all manually by hand lol. And now, most recently getting [my daily pre-market thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liazjl/212_fridays_premarket_stock_movers_news/) back going on a more consistent basis here once again.\n\nI know I'm only one dude here, but am trying all that I can to right the ship back to the old times WSB that I remembered. It's admittedly been a bit tough but I feel like maybe we're slowly making some good progress with that. :D\n\nBut anyway, I really did just want to give y'all's a big time shout out and thank you, for all of your support throughout my years on this subreddit. Seriously cannot say that enough man.\n\nAnymore, more on that weekly earnings thread of mine in here from yesterday. That thread believe it or not happened to break all sorts of records for me  here on Reddit. Not even shittin' you guys. I've been a Redditor for coming up on 8 years this year, and...\n\nHere are the records I set on my thread here from yesterday:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; *  **1.) Most hours spent holding the #1 top voted thread on r/wallstreetbets. (which mind you I think was the very first time I had ever had any thread as *the* top voted at any point during my time here).**\n\n&gt; * **2.) My most upvoted thread EVER anywhere on Reddit over my near 8 years on this site.**\n\n&gt; * **3.) Most Reddit awards (or \"guilds\" as it's called i guess in Reddit?) ever given to me in a single Reddit thread.**\n\n&gt; * **4.) and finally the most post I ever had people reply in a single Reddit thread.**\n\n*****\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/P6pJwtp.png\n\nIt was really quire remarkable for me to see if I'm being wholeheartedly honest here. Being apart of this subreddit community since near this sub's inception for me personally has been a real honor. Some people call me crazy for having a special thing in my heart for this sub. But, those few people sadly don't know much about this community's history. Some just like to hear only the negatives and don't think there isn't anything positive to say about this community. Which I think is so totally wrong.\n\nThis sub has a lot to offer. And always has. Yes, I get the past few weeks or so has been a bit hard, but that's not always how things were around here.\n\nAnyway, now I'm just rambling along here lol. Didn't intend to make this into a huge wall of text as it has become. :P\n\nBut, I did just want to take this opportunity to thank of all of you here at the community for all the awesome memories for one, and for all of your  praise and support here, I mean I can't even count how many awards were given out to me on that weekly earnings thread from yesterday. It was a pretty mind blowing tbh. Truly am very grateful for this community, and for all of you have stuck around here throughout the years here! You guys truly are the best IMHO. :)\n\nHere's to another 8 years ahead here at WSB! Keep up the awesome work here everyone!\n\nHappy Valentine's Day.\n\nApologies again for the wall text!",

Yes, the glories of WSB have been built on the charred corpses of untold retards who diamond-handed weeklies until the bitter end, and the few who climbed atop the fray to reach Valhalla. But there's an inconvenient reality that calls into question the mythology of WSB, which is that many of our most storied figures are, beyond the memes and rocket emojis, investors, rather than gamblers or their slightly more couth bretheren, traders.\n\nIf there's one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it's that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you'd like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.\n\nHopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It's the most accessible and I'm all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren't investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you've already missed the \"value\" phase and you're basically banking on something that's hard to pin down.\n\nIt's a slippery basis for an investment, but it's made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here's the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won't get you to tendie town. That's trading, not investing, and trading doesn't work out well for most people.\n\nThe unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it's a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you're an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can't sell at the peak. I think it's all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren't approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you're like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.\n\nI'd argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they're investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a \"movement\" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins. You can attach a face to it - Melvin Capital, Citadel, whatever - but it is inherently faceless.\n\nDFV didn't initially invest in a meme, or a movement - he invested in a (deep fucking) value proposition informed by his analysis of where Gamestop stood as a company and where it was heading. And then, as we all know, he held. And that's exactly what he has in common with WSB's other luminaries.\n\nIf you can see what the market doesn't yet see, put a chunk on the line that you can afford to lose, and *wait* (that's the important part) then you might have some juicy gain porn of your own to post in a year or two. You need conviction, though, or you'll just spend all your time looking at the tickers that made it big that day and move on to the next, sexier play. The only way to have conviction is to learn enough that you can actually internalize the DD that you come across and make it your own. And usually the only way to learn is to fail. Maybe that's the part of the road you're on right now, but it's a good start.\n\nEdited for TL;DR - Know the difference between trading and investing, and try to do more of the latter. ",

        "selftext": "This post will outline why I believe that Canadian Oil stocks could double (or more) in the next year. \\*Disclosure I am not a financial advisor....do your own DD \n\n**Background**\n\nThe Canadian oil industry has been depressed since 2016 due to slumping oil prices and lack of egress to international markets. This has resulted in a lack of investor interest in the sector, and thus being severely undervalued. The stock prices of many companies has not matched the commodity pricing recovery we have seen in recent months.\n\n98% of crude oil exports from Canada go to the USA. There are 3 major hydrocarbons that are produced from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin: Bitumen (oil sands), Condensate, and Natural Gas. Bitumen is mined or produced with steam, Crude/Condi and Nat gas/NGL are mostly produced with frac'ing. \n\nMuch of the condensate that is produced through frac'ing is used as diluent to ship bitumen through pipelines, so as long as heavy oil is in demand from the United States, condensate will also be in strong demand. The mixture is normally 25% condensate, 75% bitumen. Canada currently ships about 3.5 million barrels of day of crude south of the border. \n\nBecause of the lack of pipeline egress, Canada takes a bit of a discount to WTI on their crude which can range from 10% to as much as 60%. Recently, the gap has been closing rapidly due to increased demand in from Gulf Refineries. Mexico &amp; Venezuela are main competitors for heavy oil in the US, and their exports have been declining. Venezuela (sanctions and political unrest), and Mexico (more refining done domestically). Currently WCS is sitting at about $46/bbl with WTI at $59/bbl. This is the highest WCS has been since April 2019. \n\n**The Perfect Storm**\n\nWith COVID-19 vaccines being distributed around the world and the belief that North America will be completely vaccinated by Q4 2021, demand is set to explode for petroleum products. Anecdotally I know there is serious pent up demand for airplane/cruise travel. People will begin returning to their office commutes, and industrial activity will ramp up again. Experts are predicting a commodity super cycle in the next 2-5 years where oil could break $100/bbl. \n\nWTI is already trading at $60/bbl, inventories are being drawn down around the world. China's imports of crude oil grew by 18% month over month to almost 12 million bbl/day in January. Oil demand is sitting at approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels, with most white collar workers still working from home and international travel still stifled. \n\nThe United States production has also been declining, and is down 17% from the highs in March last year. Several financial institutions are turning their back on lending to American shale due to the losses incurred across the sector last year. This could all result in a demand shock that the oil industry is not ready for, and will take a few years to catch up.\n\n**The Financials**\n\nCanadian oil has needed to be much more capitally disciplined compared to their American peers in the last 5 years, due to lack of access to cheap capital and depressed oil prices. Because of this lack of debt servicing, most companies are poised to generate significant free cash flow at $60/bbl WTI. \n\nAn analysis done by Ninepoint Partners evaluated the ability of dozens of Canadian companies to buyback all their outstanding shares and pay off all debt. \n\n**The results: The average company could pay off all debt and buy back all outstanding shares with their FCF in 6.5 years at $60WTI. Some were as low as 3 years.** \n\n[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCB0kBREGhA**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCB0kBREGhA)\n\nSome of these companies are trading at multiples &lt;1x sales and &lt;2x earnings. If there is any sustained $50-60/bbl prices these companies will return tons of capital to shareholders. \n\n**Companies**\n\nHere is the current state of some attractive companies and their revenue/earnings the last time oil sustained at current prices. As you can see, these companies were posting significant earnings in 2019.\n\nAll currency in CAD.\n\n|Company|Price ($CAD)|Price (PreCOVID)|Mkt Cap (2021) ($B)|Revenue (2019) ($B)|EBITDA  (2019) ($B)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**SU**|22.89|45.00|27.5|38.3|14.1|\n|**CNQ**|34.15|42.00|40.3|24.9|11.4|\n|**CVE**|8.90|13.20|17.3|21.3|4.2|\n|**NVA**|1.67|3.20|0.38|0.56|0.15|\n|MEG|5.60|7.90|1.70|3.96|0.91|\n\nThere are plenty more companies to look at above are just a few examples. \n\n**Egress**\n\nCanada is set to have 2 new international pipelines coming online by the end of 2022 resulting in increased throughput of 1.0M bbl/day. This is without the Keystone XL pipeline that was cancelled by Biden in January.  \n\n**Risks**\n\n* 3rd wave of Covid or variants could force lockdowns again resulting in lower than projected demand\n* Joe Biden could lift sanctions on Venezuela resulting in increased competition for Gulf Refinery space and a higher WTI/WCS differential \n* OPEC could flood the market with oil again resulting in a price crash, however I don't believe they will do this as it is in their best interests to keep prices propped up. \n\nThanks for reading. Appreciate any comments.",

I know Mark Cuban also mentioned this in his call with CNBC that companies haven't paid dividends for years and that proves that the valuation of a stock is detached from the fundamentals. What does this say about fundamental investing? Does more emphasis need to be placed on the vision of a company as a measure of valuation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey also mentioned that decentralization is needed in a system, they focused more on social media but I believe it applies to financial markets too. Brokers, clearing houses, DTCC are all limited entryways to the financial markets and when it gets too crowded, there is failure like we saw this week. Will there be changes made to our financial system? Personally this has also made me understand the value thesis of cryptocurrency better. Before, I thought it was worthless because it was connected to no underlying asset but maybe decentralization is an important enough asset?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's lots of people smarter than me here so I wondering what you guys think.",

        "selftext": "The company name is thought to mean everlasting or from the sea depending on who you believe. Both are quite right. Vascepa is icosapent ethyl... a purified and modified omega-3 that when taken on top of a statin (think Lipitor) basically cuts your risk of dying, having a heart attack, or a stroke by 25%. \nSounds good right? Lipitor was the best selling drug of all time until Humira. Yet it started out slow in its first year just like Vascepa...and without a pandemic. Now we have generic statins with hundreds of millions of patients worldwide taking daily. Lipitor had its run though. Just ask Pfizer. And it still sells tons of cabbage. But there is only one Vascepa that reduces your triglycerides and reduces your cardiovascular risk. Funny thing is...it\u2019s not the triglyceride reduction that bestows the benefit......more later......Less stokes, stents, open heart bypass surgery....and DEATH!!! \n\nThere are many different oils, or properly called fatty acids, in those over the counter omega-3\u2019s you may take. But only this particular one has been shown in double blind randomized trials to Work. At least two of the others, DHA and DPA likely actually hurt!!!!! No one really knows why. We think it\u2019s it\u2019s powerful anti-inflammatory properties of 100% icosapent ethyl or EPA (Vascepa). \nThink.....\u201cit coats the insides of your arteries and puts out the fire connected to the ticking time bomb\u201d. For reference see the New England Journal of Medicine article from 2018 called the REDUCIT study. Also see the EVAPORATE study from 2020 that showed coronary artery plaque regression. That\u2019s right...Vascepa likely is liquid draino for your coronaries!!!! \n\nLet that sink in a minute. There are two large Covid-19 studies reporting in first half of this year called MITIGATe and PREPARE\u2014IT. Prepare-It will likely read out end of Feb. Mitigate interim around May. The thought is the anti inflammatory power of V helps. One Canadian study presented in December at the national lipid association showed statistics better than Remdesivir. Vascepa may snuff out the cytokines storm that kills you from Covid!!!! \nIt may also disrupt the viruses transmissibility as covid is wrapped in...you guessed it...fatty acids and lipids. \nLet that sink in a minute. \n\nAmarin won the FDA approval for CVT reduction in Dec 2019. She hit $26 soon after. March 30, 2020 a Nevada judge was hoodwinked into overturning the patents of the original label for treating only patients with triglycerides over 500 to treat pancreatitis, thus potentially allowing generics to entreat themselves to AMARIN\u2019s three billion a year US market (when mature..we only a year in). More than 90% of Vascepa scripts are for the cardiovascular indication...not for the skinny label treatment of triglycerides...for pancreatitis. The money is in the CVT risk reduction...i.e...the statin patients world wide. AMARIN spent nearly a billion dollars bringing this indication to market. And now generics want to try and steal it all. So far so good except for the market perception. AMARIN claims to have the API sources secured. \n\nThus far there is one generic made by HICKMA. The company that won the court case. Litigation is still ongoing and AMARIN is now suing them for infringing on the CVT indication patents that are still quite valid. Damages could be huge!!!! \n\nAmarin won EU recommendation for the CVT indication in Europe on Friday and can start marketing likely by April. Europe\u2019s market is maybe 50% larger than the US. Thus far Amarin has maintained the US market with Hickma currently holding 6% of the market. Yet the stock cratered from $26 to $4 in March. Today she sits just over $8. The drop was likely because all thought the US market was completely toast. Clearly it is not 4 months post generic launch. Add to this that Lovaza still makes up a large part of the prescription omega-3 market and there really is no good reason to ever take Lovaza now that Vascepa is here, and you can see that AMRN\u2019s revenues are going to be huge. Last year was unaudited $611 mill. 1 billion tax loss carry over. 550 million in cash or investments. No debt. Zero debt...... Price currently $8.25 \n\nThere seems to be a lot of selling between entities to ladder step her down almost daily since the March debacle. Despite that she has doubled. That the company updated its \u201cChange of control\u201d package and policy in an 8-k filed this Friday, one day after European approval recommendation could mean a Buy Out is imminent. Amarin was built for a buy out. She a one drug pony, but the drug is a doozy. I truly believe US can generate $1 bill in sales. EU $3 billion a year. Approval in China by Amarin partner could generate $5 bill a year but AMARIN gets a straight high teens royalty from Eddingpharm ( the Chinese owned partner) \n\nLong story short, this drug saves lives and WILL make a lot of money. Last I looked there were 22 mill shares short. With float of 386 million but much more than half the float is locked up. The daily shenanigans need to stop. The respect and eyes of the world needs to be on Vascepa!!!! It\u2019s truly a lifesaver with untold uses and benefits. I honestly believe there is a huge covid benefit to being on Vascepa and we will soon know. Let\u2019s see what happens when the PEOPLE get behind a company that has been screwed over and over yet gets back up again because the science of the drug is a once in 50 years proven scientific discovery. I bet she deservedly goes gangbusters and MOST IMPORTANTLY ....then HOLDS her gains. There won\u2019t be a find a chair when the music stops here. \nYour consideration is appreciated.",

        "selftext": "# New California Class Action Lawsuit Against Robinhood Alleges that Online Brokerage \"Switched Sides\" and \"Sacrificed\" Main Street Investors in Favor of Wall Street\n\n**PUBLISHED**JAN 29, 2021 8:00AM EST\n\nLOS ANGELES, Jan. 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0A new class action lawsuit filed in the Central District of California alleges that behemoth online brokerage, Robinhood, breached its duties to investors when it \"willfully and knowingly\" disabled certain crucial and basic trading functions crippling its clients' abilities to trade from their accounts.\n\nMain Street Investors\n\n\u00a0The complaint alleges that Robinhood clients who owned, or sought to acquire, shares of Gamestop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) and Blackberry, LTD (NYSE: BB), were damaged when Robinhood deliberately handcuffed their ability to trade, thereby benefitting Wall Street institutions.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, \"Robinhood, famous as the champion of the small retail investor(\u2026) Switched sides.\" The complaint further states that \"Robinhood acted contrary to the interests of its clients and anointed itself as the overlord of the free market, opting to damage its clients in favor of its own financial interests and the interests of other market participants, many of whom had interests directly adverse to Robinhood's clients.\" The suit asserts causes of action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Negligence and Unfair Business Practices, among others.\n\nThe case is Gossett, et al. v. Robinhood Financial, LLC, et al Case No. 21-cv-00837. The Plaintiffs are represented by Maurice Pessah of Pessah Law Group, PC (PLG) and Stuart Chelin of Chelin Law Firm, two Los Angeles based law firms.\n\nIf you believe you have suffered losses due to Robinhood's actions, or for other inquiries, please contact:\n\n[info@pessahgroup.com](mailto:info@pessahgroup.com);\u00a0[stuart@chelinlaw.com](mailto:stuart@chelinlaw.com)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 View original content:[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-california-class-action-lawsuit-against-robinhood-alleges-that-online-brokerage-switched-sides-and-sacrificed-main-street-investors-in-favor-of-wall-street-301218025.html](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-california-class-action-lawsuit-against-robinhood-alleges-that-online-brokerage-switched-sides-and-sacrificed-main-street-investors-in-favor-of-wall-street-301218025.html)\n\nSOURCE Pessah Law Group",

After pioneering deals with streaming services, buying out their competition, and upgrading their facilities worldwide, 80% short interest is highly inappropriate for its TRUE fundamental value \u2014 $69.69 a share.\n\n*\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80$AMC TO $69.69\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80*\n\n*\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80$AMC TO THE MOON\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80*\n\n\\---\n\n\"I'm questioning whether they\\[WSB\\] are actually doing the research when it comes to things like GameStop and AMC ...\" *- clueless* [*CNBC dude*](https://youtu.be/DYZHtF-tV0k?t=97)*.*\n\nI fuckin miss movies. And when I say movies, I mean the whole damn experience. I wanna buy my $15 popcorn, pour an ungodly amount of butter and jalapenos on that shit and munch in a recliner seat watching in laser 4k quality. I like this company. I like this stock.\n\nFor the past few days, I've been scouring Google for news articles and company data. I've also been trying to find some detailed DD in here but they\u2019ve all been pretty limp-dick when it came to AMC. And most of the news articles I've read were surface-level AT BEST with a grim outlook based on first-glance analysis. Guess these analysts are just too damn lazy to dig deep.\n\nBecause when we dive into these issues, we can easily see that the theater giant may not be in as bad a situation as the media/analysts are claiming.\n\nIn fact, I believe that **AMC is absolutely misunderstood, overlooked, and** **undervalued.**\n\nHere is why I am more confident than ever that $AMC will not only reach $30 but is in the perfect setup to see ATHs and WELL ABOVE.\n\n# I. Ugly Start, Beautiful Setup\n\nChances are if you are currently holding a significant position in $AMC, then most likely you've already read up on the company and its current standing in the cinema industry. You've probably read about how the corporation has nearly [$5 billion dollars worth of debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) with many of its locations still closed as the pandemic remains a global issue. You may have realized that new movies haven't been coming out. But more than that, you're seeing that movies are just being[ released on streaming platforms](https://hbr.org/2021/01/will-movie-theaters-survive-when-audiences-can-stream-new-releases) anyway. You might be concerned for AMC, or even the industry as a whole.\n\nAll of these concerns are very valid and based on real uncertainty, but let's break down each of these points and see if they\u2019re as bad as analysts claim.\n\n# II. A Discussion on Debt\n\nMedia outlets keep honing in on this debt like it\u2019s an ugly scar of the corporation. But what we need to focus on is why that debt came to be, how the money was spent, and how this debt was a strategic play in order to cement AMC into the new era of cinema-streaming.\n\nWe can categorize the money used into four parts:\n\n* **New equipment and amenities**\n* **Lease payments**\n* **Maintenance costs (utilities, wages, etc.)**\n* **Expansion (buying out the competition)**\n\nPay close attention to the last category because this one is important. Over the past five years, AMC has been [acquiring smaller theater companies](https://tracxn.com/d/acquisitions/acquisitionsbyAMC-Theatres) like [Odeon](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-theatres-closes-odeon-uci-acquisition-become-largest-exhibitor-europe-world-951348). After buying out these companies, AMC then had to suit its \"new locations\" with the standard luxury amenities AMC is known for. This makes for a significant bulk of their debt totaling over $3 billion in just acquisitions. This was the investment that helped **solidify AMCs spot as the world's largest cinema chain**.\n\nOn the topic of maintenance costs, AMC managed to raise enough money to [get through 2021](https://variety.com/2021/film/features/amc-ceo-adam-aron-coronavirus-bankruptcy-1234891440/). With ongoing news of vaccines, we can hope their efficacy leads to a speedy reopening near mid-late 2021. But when the economy *does* reopen\u2014and AMC is back at full operation\u2014what will it look like?\n\n# III. The Future of AMC\n\nThere's an elephant here.. right in this very room. Yes, streaming and cinema have had some serious beef in the past. In fact, some cinema chains are having tensions with streaming to this day. But what has AMC done in regards to streaming? They were the first to[ settle deals](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-theatres-historic-deal-windows-1234718737/) in order to partner up and take part in streaming revenue.\n\n*Yup, you read that right. AMC is both having their cake and eating it too.*\n\nWhy would motion picture companies do this? Why not just end the cinema industry? To put simply, analysts are deeply underestimating the value of the \"cinema experience\". Just as I mentioned in the intro, I miss the cinemas. But I am definitely not alone. But let's not talk about me and the hypothetical \"people'', instead let's talk about research studies.\n\nIn a 3-year study done in Korea, researchers found that shortening the window of cinema exclusivity and releasing movies on streaming early[ did **not** have a significant effect on ticket sales](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3749476). And though this is a limited study done outside of the US, remember that AMC is a global corporation and these results have a hopeful outlook for the future relationship of cinema-streaming for AMC worldwide.\n\n*\"But wait, you still haven't mentioned what streaming gets out of this?\"*\n\nIt's not what streaming \"gets out of this\" but rather what these motion picture companies maintain in keeping a healthy relationship with cinemas. During the peak heat of the movie theater-streaming feud, AMC[ halted the showing of Trolls](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/amc-theatres-trolls-world-tour-dispute-1234592445/) and vowed to never show a Universal Pictures film in its theaters again if they were to continue releasing their films on streaming platforms without a proper cinema-exclusivity window. But today, we can see that the tensions have fallen and both motion picture companies and AMC have found a way to mutually benefit each other.\n\nNow besides streaming, AMC has been investing in luxury amenities as seen by their chairs, 4K laser projectors,[ MERV air filtration](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean), and ultra-surround sound speakers. With so many locations and so many amenities, they are offering [full theater rentals](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/amc-launches-private-theater-rental-program-111020.html) with high demand during the pandemic. AMC has further cultivated their century-old movie experience into modern times. And this pandemic didn\u2019t just change their amenities.\n\nThey had to learn how to[ cut costs and have more efficient operations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) in order to survive. This only spells good news for when they emerge with better operations, more money to spend, and higher valuations. So that begs the question, how high can the company's share price go realistically?\n\n# IV. Valuation\n\nFirst, let's look at the Movie Theater industry as a whole in comparison to a few other popular entertainment industries:\n\n[Movie Theater US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/movie-theaters-united-states/) **$17.1 billion**\n\n[Casinos US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/non-hotel-casinos-united-states/) $15.7 billion\n\n[Amusement Parks US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/amusement-parks-united-states/) $14 billion\n\n[Music Label Music Production US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/major-label-music-production-united-states/) $9.4 billion\n\n[Music Publishing US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/music-publishing-united-states/) $7 billion\n\nIn the world of entertainment, cinema is a very lucrative business.\n\nAnd, again, who is the largest movie theater chain in the world? Yup,[ AMC](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2020/12/11/amc-worlds-largest-movie-theater-chain-raises-100-million-lifeline-but-it-needs-750-million-to-survive-next-year/?sh=338d2b35257b).\n\nClueless CNBC dude mentioned that we retail traders[ don't trade with a fundamental reason](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1577) but is there a fundamental reason in shorting a $17 billion dollar industry GLOBAL leader down to its grave? Does AMC deserve to die? I surely don't think so.\n\nNow I won't touch upon squeezes in this since I'm sure many of you folk have already read/heard enough about them, but I will leave this quick intuitive[ article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/investing/2021/01/27/short-squeezes-what-to-know/43360347/) about it. And yes, these shorts can and will be squoze once we have faith in our upper valuations and investors(we) begin buying again.\n\n**And buy again we will**. As many users flee limp-dick Robinhood and join one of the real brokerages, their positions/funds will be settled and ready to trade come next week. Where do you think these angry RH refugees will be putting their investments? That's right, exactly into the positions that RH stopped them from buying last week: which includes $AMC.\n\nIf you were part of the RH user base and your plays were affected by the blatant market manipulation, it's not only \"not too late\", but I believe it is an opportune time to **BUY**.\n\nHow high can it go then? When will I know it's too late to take a position?\n\nSo when we talk about valuation, many people fear the uncertainty of a stock rising far past its current value. Well, I think Chamath Palihapitiya[ said it best](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1522):\n\n***\"Everybody that bought that stock is also underwriting how they want to own it.\"***\n\nIn our current price-action environment, it's not too ridiculous to see how we are forming the foundations for AMC to continue rising beyond ATHs. We are already hitting nearly $16 on the day and rallying +53% while enduring heavy trade restrictions. Who's to say that this passion cannot continue? Now I\u2019m no expert and can\u2019t tell you how high this can go, but I am personally eyeing $69.69 as a target.\n\nWith so many current factors at play including hype, short covers, and ITM options having to be exercised, this is actually the BEST entrance to manifest its ATH valuation and chart some never before seen territory in its price action. **It's like the manifest destiny of stock valuation**. In fact, we may never see this opportunity for AMC again if we don't act now and solidify its value upward.\n\nAt the end of the day, prices are what the buyers/sellers settle upon so **WE** can pioneer that value if we damn well please. **This is what a free market is all about.**\n\n*Will there be people that disagree with this?*\n\n*Sure.*\n\nWill people continue to short AMC as it goes up?\n\n*Absolutely.*\n\nDo I think that AMC being shorted 80% and rising is fair?\n\n*Really? See section III.*\n\nBut institutions are selling off! Like [Silver Lake liquidating their 44m shares](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-entertainment-investor-silver-lake-sells-stake-51611962182).\n\n*Yes, then the next day $AMC dipped to $7.50 and has since recovered\u2026  with AMC $600m less in debt.*\n\nWe all know who is shorting AMC, and I am sick of these hedge funds who think they, alone, can decide whether or not a company is worth a damn.\n\n# V. Conclusion - Resurgence\n\nWe are at the cusp of AMCs resurgence. Because most of us have been kept from participating in social activities, we can better understand that the public is yearning for a sense of normalcy. Sure we've gone pretty far with just watching movies on our TVs or computers through the pandemic, but that doesn't scratch the itch for many folk.\n\nWhat you're investing into when you invest in AMC is the entire experience in tandem with its new streaming deals. And having been beaten so low\u2014while still holding such great fundamental prospects\u2014 its share price is ready to blow up.\n\nIn the future when \u201cThe Deep Squeeze\u201d is turned into a movie, we\u2019ll be a part of history.\n\nAnd you\u2019re going to want to see it on the big screen.\n\n\\--\n\nPosition: $50k in calls and shares\n\n*\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80$AMC TO $69.69\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80*\n\n*\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80$AMC TO THE MOON\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80*",

        "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nTest flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. \n\nLet's talk most recent timeline:\n\n**December 12 2020**: [The test flight didn't go as planned](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/#:~:text=Virgin%20Galactic%20announced%20an%20update,America%2C%20New%20Mexico%20as%20planned), a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was \"what if it blows up?\". This \"failed\" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch.\n\nFollowing this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. \n\n**February 13 2021:** [The test flight was delayed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/virgin-galactic-spce-shares-drop-as-company-delays-upcoming-spaceflight-test.html), and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit after hours and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. \n\n**February 2021:** I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic.\n\n**Q1 2021:** The [Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2020/q3/Virgin-Galactic-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane:\n\n1. This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&amp;amp;amp;V elements.\n2. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. \n3. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2)\n\nOnce Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. [Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson.](https://www.thetravel.com/ashton-kutcher-and-19-other-celebs-going-to-space-before-you-are/) The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. \n\n**Surviving to 2025:**\n\nThis is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. \n\nCurrently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.\n\nThere are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. \n\nGiven that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.\n\n**Beyond 2025:**\n\n[Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/). Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little:\n\nVirgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M\n\nMarket cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN\n\nLet's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.\n\n1. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share\n2. SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share\n3. SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share\n\nWhat's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.\n\nLet's look at Space Tourism, [the predicted market cap is $3BN](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html), which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. \n\nIf we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. \n\n**Beyond 2030:**\n\n**Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci:**\n\nThe possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.\n\n1. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.\n2. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.\n3. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.\n4. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.\n5. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.\n\n**One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:**\n\nWhile there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.\n\n**Let's Talk Technology:**\n\n[VMS Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve) is the name of the [WhiteKnightTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two) mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo) is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. [The cabin](https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/) has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. \n\nRegarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce [unveiled the Mach 3 design](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/) which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. [On a large private jet:](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost) $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. \n\nThe designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. \n\nIn my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.\n\n**Key Staff and Players:**\n\nFounder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  \nCEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  \nCTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  \nCFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.\n\n**Noteworthy Investors**:  \nVanguard  \nBank of America  \nMorgan Stanley  \nARK  \nBoeing  \nChamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  \nCathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)\n\n**Partners**:  \nBoeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nRolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  \nNASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nLockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  \nUnder Armour (suits)\n\n**Bear Case:**\n\n1. What if it explodes?\n   1. As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when [Tesla decapitated someone](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-florida-accident-20190302-story.html)? Or [the growing list of Airline incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_in_the_United_States)? Or how about when [a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds](https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/)? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic [had a fatality in 2014](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html) and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.\n2. SpaceX:\n   1. This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his [hypersonic capabilities](https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;amp;amp;itm_medium=article-body) for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.\n3. It is a hype driven stock:\n   1. This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.\n\n**TL;DR:** Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a **buying opportunity**. \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I love the stock. 1750 shares at $17",

        "selftext": "**Preface** \n\n* For whatever its worth, I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/).\n\n**I. Introduction**\n\n* The commodities boom of the 2000s saw prices [balloon to incredible heights](https://i.imgur.com/gLQfQzn.png). Over a ten-year period, the price of iron ore rose from [~$12/ton to nearly $190/ton](https://i.imgur.com/ZYTveMH.png) as surging demand across the world drove unprecedented need for raw materials. The fun was cut short in 2008 due to the Financial Crisis, however government intervention saw to a [swift rebound](https://i.imgur.com/wle4DdR.png) in industrial activity. *(Chart data from World Steel)*\n\n* If you\u2019ve been watching the markets recently, you would have noticed a major rally among all the industrial metals. [Copper](https://i.imgur.com/U2QsNSr.png). [Iron Ore](https://i.imgur.com/nSzdE4p.png). [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png). [Tin](https://i.imgur.com/lBr7RiM.png). This has been largely attributed to China\u2019s quick recovery in 2020 as well as COVID related mining disruptions driving a mismatch between supply and demand. Heading into 2021, industrial metals have continued to rise as the rest of the world begins to come online after implementing policies designed to rejuvenate the economy. Other notable factors include: a strong US response leading to a weaker dollar and growing inflation concerns, a downturn in the services sector pushing consumers towards commodity intensive goods, and higher than ever global demand for large scale renewable infrastructure. All against a static, underinvested mining capacity owing to the [bearish environment](https://i.imgur.com/4dmwQmG.png) over the last ten years. \n\n* I believe the current environment has primed metals and other commodities to see prolonged, elevated demand not seen since the previous commodity supercycle as a strong resurgence in manufacturing precedes a long-term, worldwide push towards renewable energy infrastructure.\n\n**II. Coronavirus &amp; Government Intervention**\n\n* The impact from the pandemic was far worse than the 2008 recession. A large-scale shutdown threw unemployment to the [stratosphere](https://i.imgur.com/3S0Gt56.png) and devastated the [markets](https://www.thebalance.com/fundamentals-of-the-2020-market-crash-4799950). The conditions were so poor it forced [governments around the world](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19) to rapidly pass a series of heavy handed social and monetary policies \u2013 **note the US [absolutely jacked up the money supply](https://i.imgur.com/1vTd0GI.png) and [lowered rates to near zero](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-slashes-interest-rates-zero-part-wide-ranging-emergency-intervention/)** \u2013 to revitalize the economy and prevent further deterioration. \n\n* The impact wasn\u2019t just limited to consumers, businesses also felt the pressure as many manufacturers \u2013 expecting lower demand \u2013 [cut back on production and capacity]( https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/coronavirus-impacts-industrial-manufacturing.html#content-free-1-6e9a) as the commercial sector saw activity grind to a sharp stop. Miners, anticipating a period of economic weakness, not only sharply cut back production but also saw [severe disruptions](https://www.mining.com/worldwide-mining-disruptions/) across mining sites as COVID breakouts forced projects into suspension. \n\n* Note that the sheer amount of financial support in 2020 far outstripped the [government response in 2008](https://i.imgur.com/TMs02Ot.png). The [$2T legislation in March](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/stimulus-package-details-coronavirus/index.html) was followed with [$900B in December](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/20/politics/second-covid-stimulus-package-details/index.html) and President Biden has promised [another $1.9T proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-covid-relief/) and [$2T infrastructure proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/02/11/biden-senators-infrastructure/).\n\n**III. Industrial Demand**\n\n* Due to their rigid response to the pandemic, China led the world recovery, with the rest of the world not far off, driving an early surge in commodity demand and sending metals prices soaring. With the services market almost entirely shut down, buyers had turned to more [commodity intensive goods](https://www.wsj.com/articles/factories-bounce-back-as-consumers-snap-up-goods-11604315271) and [overwhelmed the markets](https://theloadstar.com/its-a-juggling-act-say-handlers-as-cargo-congestion-swamps-europes-airports/). Unexpected consumer demand drained inventories and manufacturers found themselves with record setting backlogs. This shift was further supported by the government\u2019s stimulus programs, actively adding spending power to the consumer class.\n\n* For some time now, there has been growing focus around renewable energy infrastructure and green policies. Current trends have pushed back against [new investment into coal](https://i.imgur.com/xDiza5H.png) and [Oil &amp; Gas](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/28/joe-biden-keystone-pipeline-climate-crisis) and [numerous](https://i.imgur.com/VweHRwA.png) [countries](https://i.imgur.com/vZRsX4o.png) [have](https://i.imgur.com/16DSmh2.png) announced environmental targets. Renewable investments have been highly profitable with [studies stating](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/05/28/just-how-good-an-investment-is-renewable-energy-new-study-reveals-all/?sh=7b9d17194d27) that renewables investments in Germany and France yielded returns of 178.2% over a five year period, compared with -20.7% for fossil fuel investments. [The International Renewable Energy Agency](https://www.irena.org/financeinvestment/Investment-Needs#:~:text=In%20its%20latest%20analysis%2C%20Global,in%20the%202016%2D2050%20period) stated the world would require an additional $27T in infrastructure spending from 2016-2050 fulfill the objects of the Paris Agreement. Annual renewable investments in 2018 would have needed to [double](https://i.imgur.com/aKqAwSh.png) to be on track to meet targets and **[Goldman Sachs believes that the capital expenditure cycle could rival the 2000s](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-supercycle-ahome-idUSKBN29A1QM).** \n\n* China has announced they expect [higher steel demand](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-steel-idUSL1N2K204Z) vs last year. [Economists now see US-China GDP parity in 2028 from 2033](https://i.imgur.com/OOkc7mO.png). Both the US and China are looking to upset one another and it\u2019s hard to see demand slacking with [two world powers competing](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56036245) to achieve faster greenification and out-GDP the other. Note that [India](https://i.imgur.com/coaL6YG.png) joined the infrastructure bandwagon last year and continued to emphasize infrastructure in their [latest budget](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/india-budget-health-care-infrastructure-and-fiscal-deficit.html). Countries have begun to launch major projects to meet their targets or as a tool to generate economic activity. [South Korea](https://www.power-technology.com/news/south-korea-plans-build-43bn-offshore-wind-farm/). [Scotland](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d4355db2-3036-4450-b2a0-611a56d944bf). [EU](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-leaders-close-in-on-coronavirus-recovery-plan-deal-11595274568). [Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-transit-fund-1.5908346). [Higher iron ore imports](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/iron-ore-imports-outside-china-show-signs-of-recovery-russell).\n\n* Furthermore, EVs will require significant resources for new factories, batteries, and cars. This demand is already noticeable on [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png) and analysts have increasingly raised their [projections](https://www.mining.com/nickel-demand-for-evs-expected-to-shoot-up-in-the-next-20-years/) on the metal. Ford even admits [here](https://www.mining.com/web/ford-joins-global-initiative-to-promote-responsible-mining/) they will be more reliant on mined material going forward. [These guys will probably need more metals too](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/tesla-to-start-making-cars-in-india-targeting-sprawling-market).\n\n* Global construction is looking at a [record growth](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2021/02/global-market-scan-2021-a-year-of-recovery-and-reacceleration-in-global-construction) for the year. Additionally, expanding the sector is a way for governments to have an immediate effect on [employment](https://i.imgur.com/JnbiYUS.png) and thus the economy. [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/infrastructure-stimulus-in-covid-pandemic-recovery-and-beyond)\n\n* Lastly, the most recent [ISM](https://www.ismworld.org/globalassets/pub/research-and-surveys/rob/pmi/rob202102pmi.pdf) manufacturing index has continued to point towards growth with low inventory, high backlog, and overall bullish outlook on economic activity.  [Btw](https://i.imgur.com/6oK8as7.png) \n\n**IV. Financial Demand**\n\n* The government\u2019s expansionary monetary policies were successful in staving off further deterioration, however this resulted in extremely low interest rates across the world as well as a sharp increase in the money supply. [The DXY has weakened](https://i.imgur.com/JC9Yylb.png) starting in March 2020 and [current consensus](https://currency.com/usd-forecast-2021#:~:text=US%20dollar%20news%3A%20more%20pain%20ahead&amp;text=Setting%20out%20its%20USD%20forecast,against%20most%20major%20fiat%20currencies.) is that it will further devalue as the Biden administration implements the $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure proposals. The massive printing [heightened inflation concerns](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-13/inflation-is-coming-to-the-u-s-and-the-fed-could-be-in-a-bind) and the demand for hedges such as metals. Furthermore, a [low dollar](https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-dollar-impacts-commodity-prices-809294) raises the buying power of foreign currency and [low rates](https://www.thebalance.com/commodity-prices-when-interest-rates-rise-4084273) ease capital for companies; both are economically linked to higher commodity prices.\n\n* Alongside the economic machinations at play, major financial institutions such as [Goldman Sachs](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-supercycle-ahome-idUSKBN29A1QM) and [JPMorgan](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fifth-commodity-supercycle-has-started-says-highly-regarded-jpmorgan-strategist-11613044794) have announced they see the beginnings of a commodity supercycle with some forecasts seeing iron ore as high as [$165/t for three years]( https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-price-jumps-as-vale-reports-low-output/) as others upgrade their projections on [steel](https://i.imgur.com/FuUtHLj.png). Not all metal demand is strictly industrial and trader demand for these metals for speculation and inflation hedging purposes are likely to further increase.\n\n* PS. [This was JPMorgan just a little while ago](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/jpmorgan-defends-its-call-on-metal-trades-after-investor-backlash.html) \n\n**V. Commodities, Metals, and Mines** \n\n* The March contraction reversed at breakneck pace to a bullish narrative as all indicators pivoted towards prolonged, stronger economic activity. Government policies have bolstered the consumer class with direct payments, weakening the US dollar and driving inflation concerns, as the world powers race towards renewable infrastructure to jump start their economies. With service businesses suppressed with social restrictions, consumer demand has shifted towards commodity heavier goods resulting in manufacturers with low inventory, high backlogs, and rising raw material costs. Renewable infrastructure will remain a long term driver for capital expenditure as the US and China gear up for economic superiority while other major nations look to meet their own environmental pledges. \n\n* All these demand drivers are expected to be significantly accretive to metals and metals producers. Metals prices are soaring and are expected to remain elevated for some time both on continued market demand as well as the devaluation of the US dollar under the government\u2019s upcoming spending agenda. The markets \u2013 on near zero interest rates \u2013 are still unwinding the last two major stimulus bills from March and December and the Biden administration has an additional $1.9T and $2.0T planned with potentially more support even after that. **Miners, aware of the impending inflection point, have already pledged to intensify cash distribution to shareholders.** $MT announced [$650M +$570M buyback](https://corporate.arcelormittal.com/media/press-releases/arcelormittal-announces-share-buyback-program-3) and issued $0.30 dividends. $FCX announced a [performance based buyback policy alongside a cash dividend of $0.30/share](https://investors.fcx.com/investors/news-releases/news-release-details/2021/Freeport-McMoRan-Announces-Reinstatement-of-Common-Stock-Dividend-and-Adoption-of-Performance-Based-Payout-Policy/default.aspx).\n\n* Mines have traditionally been heavily slow businesses with lead times for construction to full production as long as [8 years](https://www.extractiveshub.org/topic/view/id/21/chapterId/268). While the jump from 2008-2010 came off a strong bull cycle with many mines already well into capacity expansion and new projects, 2020 has come off one of mining\u2019s worst downcycles with weak capacity investments as miners opted to scale down from preexisting operations. In fact, 2020 saw production of [iron ore](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-iron-ore.pdf), [copper](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-copper.pdf), and [nickel](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-nickel.pdf) all flat to lower versus last year. Current miners can tap deeper into current capacity to produce at higher output, however there will be no major development in new capacity at least for the near term until metals prices rise high enough to attract significant new investments into the sector. Given high enough demand, a supply bottleneck is a very real possibility.\n\n**VI. Conclusion**\n\n* The pandemic induced recession was far worse than any previous downturn and it required a heavy handed government response to stabilize the economy. The economic recovery is gaining momentum each day and the commodity landscape is primed for further growth as nations increasingly invest in infrastructure and the US dollar continues to weaken. Both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs stated they see the beginnings of the next commodity supercycle and the US has yet to deploy nearly $4T in stimulus and infrastructure. Renewable infrastructure has shown strong rate of returns and IRENA stated countries must double their annual infrastructure investment to remain on track to meet pledged targets. Additionally, the US-China standoff has transitioned into an economic competition over EVs and renewable infrastructure.\n\n* Metals prices and miners are set to benefit immensely as major demand drivers act on constrained underinvested capacity due to a decade of bearish market activity. These companies have pledged to funnel large portions of their newfound profits to shareholders through increased dividends and sizable buyback programs. The most recent $900B stimulus in December has yet to fully unwind, we have yet to see the impact of Biden\u2019s $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure policy, and concerns around inflation have never been higher. All factors point towards heightened economic activity and heightened financial demand. Inflation, market demand, and short supply all combined; I see considerable upside for commodities, metals, and miners well into the future.\n\n* $FCX 1/21c @32, $MT 1/21c @25, $VALE 1/21c @20\n\n**Tl;dr:** [Fed print; metals go brrr](https://i.redd.it/bxn2mf4bzoj41.jpg)\n\n**P.S.** [Mining Stocks](https://i.imgur.com/bsXSJvP.png)\n\n**P.P.S.** [Metals Prices](https://i.imgur.com/qP8aCJ3.jpg)",

The company is developing a portfolio of natural gas production, liquefied natural gas marketing, and infrastructure assets that includes an approximately 27.6 million tons per annum lng terminal facility and an associated pipeline in southwest Louisiana. As of February 24, 2020, it owned interests in approximately 10,260 net acres and 67 producing wells located in the Haynesville Shale trend of north Louisiana. The company was founded in 2016 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas.\n\nTellurian [currently develops liquified natural gas](https://www.tellurianinc.com/), aka LNG.  Lng is a secure, low-cost natural gas.It's designed and constructed for low-cost liquefaction.  Tellurian delivers reliable and flexible LNG to a portfolio of global customers, allowing them to operate business safely, efficiently, and reliably.   Premier management team with performance track record.\n\nTELL has proposed over 1,000 miles and $7 billion in pipeline infrastructure that will create 15,000 construction and operating jobs in the U.S. The Tellurian Pipeline Network is led by [Joey Mahmoud.](https://energy-dialogues.com/ped/speaker/joey-mahmoud-2/)\n\nGlobal demand for liquified natural gas grew by 12.5% to 359 million tonnes in 2019, according to [Shell's latest annual LNG Outlook](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/natural-gas/liquefied-natural-gas-lng/lng-outlook-2020.html#iframe=L3dlYmFwcHMvTE5HX291dGxvb2sv).  This is a significant increase that bolsters Lng's growing role in the transition to a lower-carbon energy system.\n\nAsian LNG demand grew 17% YoY. Lets talk about some some major countries:\n\n* China- Improved gas infrastructure penetration increases demand.  Increased industrial demand from economic recovery.\n* India- Government policy to support natural gas to tackle pollution issues and energy poverty.\n* Europe- Increased reliance on imported gas due to domestic declines.  Higher C02 prices and climate action urgency boost demand\n* Southeast Asia- Fastest growing region for power demand at 5.4% in 2021.  Limited private-sector financing for new coal projects makes LNG attractive as a baseload fuel.\n\n[Biden has stressed since day 1](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/podcasts/the-daily/biden-climate-agenda.html) that climate change is the number one issue facing humanity.

Due to the crazy demand, this number can grow to 100x. Price to sales ratio is very high and they will also dominate with market capitalization given how ahead they are in this space. They are estimated to have 9% growth in market share each year, and that number can be even higher if the countries mentioned keep pushing for more green friendly options given the Biden campaign and the influence on other countries all over the world.\n\nThe points align.  The prices of Lng are going to be up by a huge margin, which will get converted into revenue, and the stock price will increase.\n\n[Charif Souki, Chairman of Tellurian- discussing the stock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64XV9GTekTI&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\n[Tellurian presentation on the future of the company](https://www.tellurianinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corporate-presentation_Tellurian_January-2021_FINAL.pdf)\n\nChamath, Musk, Bezos, and Branson all need this company.  Each of these guys have a space company.  You may not know this, but SpaceX Rockets are powered by LNG.  For every test run and real run that rockets go to space, they require lots of LNG, which is in limited supply, which contributes to the price.

Do not interpret this post as financial advisory.\n\n**1) Motivations for Posting**\n\nThose who have and will read my posts may notice I have commented a few times on this forum in my efforts to find, consolidate, and present my research on ETFM/FOMO Corp.\n\nI myself, though only several months into the penny stock game, find myself continually trying to answer the question of \\*reliability\\* with respect to my picks. Thus far, I have avoided getting myself stuck in penny situations which result in losses. However, a streak of continued success, I intuit, is all the more reason to be skeptical.\n\nThat being said, this post is not exactly a DD, as there are several good DDs out there on this sub (not referring to my small updates) and even on video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u\\_rAPq83kn4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_rAPq83kn4)\n\nThus, this post is meant to directly evaluate the recent price movement and whether it is the result of a P&amp;D.\n\n**2) ETFM/FOMO recent price movement - How did we get to the green?**\n\nIn order to make sense of ETFM/FOMO Corp's current pricing, it is necessary to take a look at its price history over the past few years. This is in line with u/alexsmith2332 's recommendation: \"look to the left.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[5 Year](https://preview.redd.it/vguy025s8nh61.jpg?width=217&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f14680234e3ae5f88f4b1395a4a814d556601e0a)\n\nGoing back to 2015, when the company was still an EV company by the name of 2050 Motors, we can see a volatile, yet steady downward trend into an abyss of dereliction by 2017. There, largely, the company's price remained at an abysmal .0001 USD/share (or less) until Fall 2020 with little movement occurring with a notable exception at the news of Vik Grover's accession to the position of CEO in March 2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img tygi22mu8nh61...*\n\nHowever, in Fall 2020, beginning in September, we can see the stock price come back to life (though not necessarily dramatically) coinciding the company statements regarding their acquisition of Purge Virus, AGILE, and their rebranding and self-reinvention as FOMO Corp - an incubator for innovative technologies primarily - but not exclusively - related to high-intensity light sanitation and disinfection technologies.  \n\n\n*Processing img ud28d2iw8nh61...*\n\nThe 6-month chart shows a very slight upward aggregate trend in share price dotted by four moderate to large price spikes and regressions - Sept, Oct, Nov 2020 and Jan 2021. These spikes appear to coincide with company news bear the characteristic heart-monitor pattern that P&amp;Ds can often hold.  \n\n\n*Processing img ftr62kfy8nh61...*\n\nThis brings us to our most recent price increase here in Feb 2021 which is much more pronounced than any of the others and has largely been sustained in an increasing upward trend for the past two weeks.  \n\n\n3) Volume reflections\n\nSo now we've laid out our data. Let's apply some analysis and answer our question: is this a P&amp;D? In light of u/alexsmith2332 's recommendations in his post here: \\[insert\\] , we will look at the relation between price fluctuations and trading volume. I now draw my attention to several key price points which I outlined for myself in section 2, namely Sept, Oct, Nov 2020, Jan and Feb 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSept 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 5qxi2yp0anh61...*\n\nWe can see an abrupt jump in stock price here which appears to coincide with the company coming back to life from a largely derelict status. This point marks the beginning of ETFM/FOMO corp's acquisition and debt elimination program, coinciding with their planned and then actualized acquisition of Purge Virus. Investment interest appears to have kicked up with this news and company action.  \n\n\nOct, Nov, Jan 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tll4i82anh61.jpg?width=295&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f78295c463343e0ac99dd0462c1894955e1cb187\n\nTogether with Sept, these round-date price point data represent large spikes (at least 100% value increases) followed by steep regressions to the mean ultimately resulting in share valuations approximately 10-20% higher than the price points preceding the spikes. In each of these examples, trading volume skyrocketed approximately 20x volume levels of the preceding day with near-equivalent volume accompanying the spikes on the day following the volume and price spikes, yet with counterbalancing decrease in share valuation instead of increase.\n\nAt each of these points, this could read, much as outlined in r/alexsmith2332 's post, like archetypal P&amp;D movement.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***HOWEVER\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nFeb 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2ghsqn3anh61.jpg?width=157&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d13af28225dd8b7e9390389e95ba6474026b820\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur final and most recent price movement - far more dramatic in its upward movement than any of the prior price points - bears two characteristics that separate it from these earlier four identified points.\n\n1) Unlike the earlier spikes in share valuation which rose and sank over the course of a single day, the upward movement experienced since the beginning of February 2021 has compounded and been sustained over the course of a 10-14 day interval.\n\n2) The Sept-Jan price spikes were accompanied by intense 1-2 spikes in trading volume. The past 10-14 days in upward price movement, despite being more dramatic in absolute value of share price increase, do not represent an aberrant spike in trading volume corresponding to share price increase. Indeed, trading volume has increased, but trading volume has increased gradually, suggesting that recent price movement has corresponded to genuinely bullish appraisal of share valuation compared to momentary valuation spikes and drop-offs from sensationalism.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nSo does this mean ETFM/FOMO is headed to the moon? I don't know.\n\nDoes this mean ETFM/FOMO is not being pumped for an imminent dump? I don't know.\n\n**Well, what do you know, then?** \\- The data which I have laid out above - and which I have examined for my own benefit, potential profit, and peace of mind - suggest one thing with certainty: \n\nAt least as our data stand now, the volume and price movement relationships in Feb 2021 DO NOT match sensationalist-archetypal volume-price spike patterns, nor do they match those pattern correlates which were present during the Sept, Oct, Nov 2020, and Jan 2021 dramatic price movements in ETFM/FOMO Corp. \n\nThis does not necessarily mean I am \\*certain\\* this is not happening now across a greater frame of reference. This is potentially the case and we won't know whether that is indeed occurring on a 1-month vs 1-day scale until more time has passed. To paraphrase Kierkegaard: Life is a process that can only be understood in reverse, but must be lived forward.\n\nSo how can I make a reasonable decision about buying/selling/HODLing, etc.? - I can't advise you to take any particular course of action or make any particular decision. I can, however, share my decision-making process. \n\nAs a current investor in ETFM/FOMO corp, the recent relationship between price and volume data as I have compared them to prior relationships (at the data points I have discussed above) and to archetypal relationships (as outlined in u/alexsmith2332 's post) suggests to me that currently ETFM/FOMO corp does not appear subject to P&amp;D-type activity. Additionally, recent DD information - company news, CEO updates, company document analysis - increases my own confidence in my discernment of the current situation. This does not make it certain, but it does provide additional information that - at least for now - corroborates my interpretation.\n\nThat being said, I am always looking for new information to either prove my prior interpretations wrong or confirm my fundamental presuppositions for another day.\n\nWith all this taken into consideration, at the very least I am happy to have performed this as an exercise in the hopes it will improve my decision-making as a trader and investor. I am open to comments, concerns, and any potential flaws in this very elementary examination of these data. I hope, in no matter what context, this thinking process may serve as useful to the general community and make us all wiser and sounder in the days ahead.  \n\n\nYours",

        "selftext": "  \n\n**Corporate Universe $COUV**\n\nCorporate Universe, Inc. is based in New York and is a holdings company actively looking to acquire companies with a strong asset base and solid cash flow. They offer financial and managerial support for these companies in order to aid development in domestic and international markets. The company have a goal to build a portfolio of diversified assets and investments across various industries to create shareholder value. I first heard of this company from reading the Bloomberg article on the LOI with ZapGo.\n\nThe CEO Isaac H. Sutton has been at the head of 7 different companies and has over 40 years\u2019 entrepreneurial experience, especially in emerging markets with a proven track record of founding and running successful companies, holding multiple roles as either President, CEO or Chairman of the Board. Such as Go IP.\n\n**Medicevo**\n\nSo far the company have acquired a 51% stake in Medicevo which is a medical supply chain company. The company have created a face mask using graphene in the fabric to kill 98% of COVID-19 particles. The company was founded in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and distribute there state of the art masks throughout north America and Canada. The PPE has been described as cutting edge and affordable. The masks cost lest that $10 each due to a Patented technology that implants the graphite on the fabric in a much more cost effective way than competitors. \n\nUp until now it has been difficult to find a reusable, cost-effective masks that is also affordable. Now, you have the best face mask option offering a comfortable, stylish, and affordable way to not just stop, but kill bacteria and viruses. This in my opinion a smart acquisition from Corporate and shows that management are on the ball when it comes to spotting relevant and highly innovative products.\n\n**Carbon Ion Energy Storage** \n\nCorporate universe so far announced they have entered into a definitive LOI to acquire Carbon Ion energy storage LTD (or fka ZapGo to some) on the December 16th 2020. ZapGo focus on building next gen energy storage devices that are safe, fast charging and do not require the use of rare-earth materials allowing them to be easily recycled at end of life. \n\nThroughout the world renewable energy and electrification are becoming increasingly important. The global market for battery technology was $113 billion dollars in 2019 and is expected to increase 3 fold in the next 5 years ($640Bn by 2040). There has been many advances in Li batteries in the past 50 years however Carbon could be the solution looking forward into the next 50 years.\n\nZapGo Points of interest from Investors Presentation:\n\n\u00b7 30 Patents and the benefit of $25 million R&amp;D ( having gone through these Patents there is a lot of potential with some seriously revolutionary technology, link 8)\n\n\u00b7 Improved energy storage in comparison to Li batteries allows for a range of applications (phone batteries, car batteries, EV fast charging and grid storage)\n\n\u00b7 Battery Pack that could support Tesla model 5 weighs 15 pounds v tesla battery pack 1200 pounds. This would improve range and speed.\n\n\u00b7 High specific power allows for very fast charging within seconds through instant charge technology (50 times faster than Li batteries).\n\n\u00b7 Improved safety allows for easy shipping and potential application in hazardous areas.\n\n\u00b7 Long Life cycle eliminating service internals and saving money\n\n\u00b7 Recyclable at end of life\n\nIn a statement about the acquisition Isaac Sutton said \u201c As I've previously told our shareholders, our goal was to identify opportunity for our shareholders, and in this transaction, I believe we have exceeded expectations and couldn't be more excited to bring this opportunity to the market and our shareholders. Effective with the closing which is targeted before years end, Andrew will assume the CEO position, and I will become the COO. I will be focused on moving the public company expeditiously and compliantly towards a senior exchange, as Andrew ( Andrew Sispoidis new CEO, link 7 for more info) and the team are focused on the business of batteries. I believe this next year will be transformative.\u201d\n\nCorporate universe released a press release on the December 30th 2020 saying the \u201cparties have been working diligently towards the close, which is now anticipated in mid-January, while originally slated before years end with the holidays and complexity of the transaction this timeline has proven to challenging.\u201d\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt is key to remember that the risk factor is significant with penny stocks however given the technology ZapGo has to offer the reward outweighs the risk for me. I expect that the merger will close some time this month given the press release states they anticipated the deal to complete by mid-January. I am Unsure as to what could have held the deal up to now but am grateful as it has presented a buying opportunity. \n\nIf the merger goes through which I\u2019m almost certain it will given what we know , I would expect a gain of 50% + from the current price. If the LOI was good enough to grab the attention of Bloomberg to write an article I suspect the merger will too. The technology speaks for itself and with a wide range of applications has huge potential.\n\nI currently hold 15,000 shares of $COUV at a cost basis of $0.39. My plan is to sell a portion of these when the merger is announced and move the profits into my other favourite energy play Tuscan Holdings $THCB.I also suspect there could be a lot of hype around this when it comes to more peoples attention with speculation of a NASDAQ listing already circulating. Good luck all and let me know in the comments if you have any more information you think is relevant and I missed.",

        "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nTest flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. \n\nLet's talk most recent timeline:\n\n**December 12 2020**: [The test flight didn't go as planned](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/#:~:text=Virgin%20Galactic%20announced%20an%20update,America%2C%20New%20Mexico%20as%20planned), a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was \"what if it blows up?\". This \"failed\" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch.\n\nFollowing this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. \n\n**February 13 2021:** [The test flight was delayed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/virgin-galactic-spce-shares-drop-as-company-delays-upcoming-spaceflight-test.html), and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit after hours and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. \n\n**February 2021:** I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic.\n\n**Q1 2021:** The [Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2020/q3/Virgin-Galactic-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane:\n\n1. This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&amp;V elements.\n2. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. \n3. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2)\n\nOnce Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. [Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson.](https://www.thetravel.com/ashton-kutcher-and-19-other-celebs-going-to-space-before-you-are/) The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. \n\n**Surviving to 2025:**\n\nThis is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. \n\nCurrently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.\n\nThere are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. \n\nGiven that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.\n\n**Beyond 2025:**\n\n[Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/). Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little:\n\nVirgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M\n\nMarket cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN\n\nLet's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.\n\n1. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share\n2. SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share\n3. SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share\n\nWhat's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.\n\nLet's look at Space Tourism, [the predicted market cap is $3BN](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html), which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. \n\nIf we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. \n\n**Beyond 2030:**\n\n**Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci:**\n\nThe possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.\n\n1. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.\n2. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.\n3. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.\n4. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.\n5. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.\n\n**One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:**\n\nWhile there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.\n\n**Let's Talk Technology:**\n\n[VMS Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve) is the name of the [WhiteKnightTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two) mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo) is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. [The cabin](https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/) has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. [Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8T9mVkGh3s)\n\nRegarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce [unveiled the Mach 3 design](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/) which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. [On a large private jet:](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost) $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. \n\nThe designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. \n\nIn my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.\n\n**Key Staff and Players:**\n\nFounder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  \nCEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  \nCTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  \nCFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.\n\n**Noteworthy Investors**:  \nVanguard  \nBank of America  \nMorgan Stanley  \nARK  \nBoeing  \nChamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  \nCathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)\n\n**Partners**:  \nBoeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nRolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  \nNASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nLockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  \nUnder Armour (suits)\n\n**Bear Case:**\n\n1. What if it explodes?\n   1. As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when [Tesla decapitated someone](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-florida-accident-20190302-story.html)? Or [the growing list of Airline incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_in_the_United_States)? Or how about when [a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds](https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/)? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic [had a fatality in 2014](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html) and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.\n2. SpaceX:\n   1. This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his [hypersonic capabilities](https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body) for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.\n3. It is a hype driven stock:\n   1. This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.\n\nThank you all for reading, **if you don't want to actually read this check out the video DD:**\n\n[Video DD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V4VxAuQDFM)\n\n**TL;DR:** Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a **buying opportunity**. \n\nIf this DD was too long and the video DD was also too long check out the Too Long Didn't Watch (TL;DW) video here: \n\n[TL;DW Video DD](https://youtu.be/AKhDnS3Ipic)",

(https://roboticassistancedevices.com/) (https://radroameo.com/)\n\n\nAITX currently has about 30+ employees distributed across offices in the USA and Canada, with plans to grow to approx 50-60 employees by year end 2021 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6IXHyZ291U).

(https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/AITX/profile)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n \n2 - AI is emerging tech, currently a 40 billion dollar industry, that is projected to grow at a 40% compound annual growth rate; that's a $1.1 trillion market by 2030. The AI sector still has alot of room for growth and AITX is positioning itself to capitalize in this new, rapid-growth market.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n \n3 - AITX currently offers 4 software applications and 6 hardware devices for mobile and stationary security solutions that combine lower security costs with enhanced security features (https://roboticassistancedevices.com/solutions/). These devices are ever-vigilant, always-aware, non-corruptible, and non-discriminatory. AITX\u2019s security technologies are replacing expensive manpower, that is largely doing nothing, with sophisticated technologies that can do a lot, at a far lower cost. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n4 - AITX  designs, creates, engineers, and develops all solutions in-house; from point A to point Z,  AITX controls the entire supply chain. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6IXHyZ291U)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n \n5 - AITX recently filed its latest quarterly report showing that AITX is entering a stage of high-growth, demonstrating significant signs of positive company results. Quarter over quarter:\n\n - Accounts receivable more than doubled\n\n - Total company debts/liabilities decreased by approx 24%\n\n - Gross profit more than doubled\n\n - Cash on hand increased by approx 35%\n\n - Total company assets increased by approx 40%\n\n - Revenues increased by 60% \n\n(https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=14624922&amp;guid=ngBKUWRpjODiDth)\n(https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=14443369&amp;guid=ngBKUWRpjODiDth)\n(https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/AITX/overview)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n6 - AITX currently has dealership agreements in place with 15-20 security companies worldwide for device and applications deployment, including agreements with 2 of the largest security companies in the world, Allied Universal and Securitas AB (https://roboticassistancedevices.com/clients-dealers-partners/).

(https://roboticassistancedevices.com/robotic-assistance-devices-announces-dealer-agreement-with-protos-security/)\n(https://roboticassistancedevices.com/robotic-assistance-devices-announces-dealer-agreement-with-civitas-group/)\n(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210212005118/en/Robotic-Assistance-Devices-Indicates-that-Momentum-for-Products-Accelerates---Receives-Multiple-Orders)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n7 - Allied Universal is AITX\u2019s largest dealer by sales orders. Allied Universal will soon be the largest security company in the world. AITX President Steve Reinharz recently shared in chat with shareholders that \u201cAllied loves ROAMEO\u201d  - ROAMEO is AITX\u2019s recently developed, high-tech, autonomous mobile security device; high interest from Allied in ROAMEO could translate into significant future deployments and significant increase in revenues (https://roboticassistancedevices.com/roameo/).  Further elaborating on Allied Universal\u2019s relationship with AITX, Steve also has stated, \u201cit\u2019s pretty exciting when the world\u2019s largest security company is a fan, and I\u2019m really grateful to them for that\u201d (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly29Sq0R4KY). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n8 - The recent quarterly report also shed some light further on the great demand for AITX\u2019s ROAMEO device, it states:\n\n - \u201cThe Company received pre-order letters of intent from dealers and end users for 76 ROAMEO units that represents approximately $320,000 in monthly recurring revenue. The Company is working to turn these pre-orders into firm orders with an expectation that conversions could begin in the first quarter of the new fiscal year ended February 28, 2022. It is expected that ROAMEO production ramp-up time will take at least two quarters during fiscal 2022 to fulfill converted pre-orders.with backlog of orders representing $16 million of revenue, already with letters of intent (LOI).\u201d\n\n\nThis would represent approx $19 million of revenue over the 5-year ROAMEO contract life-span. \n\n\n\nThis is a significant increase from the previously released figure of $16 million in ROAMEO pre-orders, suggesting that the orders keep rolling in for ROAMEOs.\n(https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=14624922&amp;guid=KNBKU62ZL28guth)\n(https://radroameo.com/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n9 - AITX technologies are versatile and offer significant benefits and potential savings to multiple industries, and the company has begun to see the adoption of its solutions in multiple verticals.

(https://roboticassistancedevices.com/robotic-assistance-devices-announces-growth-upgrades-two-locations/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n19 - By efficiently streamlining their supply chain while expanding their production capacity, AITX has recently achieved decreased lead times, by as much as nearly 40%. This will help dealers and customers be able to more quickly receive and implement AITX solutions into their projects and enterprises. AITX President Steve Reinharz has stated that starting in March, AITX\u2019s 2 most popular devices, AVA and ROSA, will now be available to be ordered via a Quick Ship option that will see the devices shipped within 72 hours of order.

In the most recent Q&amp;A with shareholders AITX President Steve Reinharz stated that there will be one new hardware device revealed and two new software solutions revealed in 2021.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n \n21 - AITX is US reporting: Full SEC reporting; it is very rare to find full SEC reporting companies in microcaps and OTC Pinks markets - the fact that AITX is full SEC reporting demonstrates the company\u2019s commitment to full shareholder transparency. (https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/AITX/profile).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n22 - AITX President Steve Reinharz is committed to making himself accessible and available to AITX shareholders and the investor community at large. He has stated that he feels that his second mission, as AITX expands, is to work to expand the AITX investor base and increase the exposure and raise the profile of AITX in the investor community (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWEB9srh7OE). He frequently makes himself available on the AITX chat with shareholders, engages with investors on social media, and has regularly scheduled once-a-month Q&amp;A\u2019s with shareholders.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: Position below, none of this is advice and I am just posting my opinions about what a lot of recent events mean and how they might tie together. Buy at your own risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSup guys, I just bought about 2000 shares of TLOFF and here's why\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, Papa Musk begged miners to start mining Nickle (but more than just that, see below link):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-nickel/please-mine-more-nickel-musk-urges-as-tesla-boosts-production-idUSKCN24O0RV](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-nickel/please-mine-more-nickel-musk-urges-as-tesla-boosts-production-idUSKCN24O0RV)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is also posted on Bloomberg, but that's behind a paywall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow not only does Musk promise a \"Giant contract\" for a \"long period of time\", but he specifies the nickel must be mined efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way. Here is the clip of Elon:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzn8Zl02VE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzn8Zl02VE)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n0:24 seconds starts the segment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow check out Talon Metals:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://talonmetals.com/what-is-green-nickel/](https://talonmetals.com/what-is-green-nickel/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the Tamarack Project, located in Minnesota, USA, we believe that nickel should be produced in an environmentally friendly and socially responsible way. It means that from mine to battery, every step is carefully controlled.\n\n\u201cWith Green Nickel we want people to feel good about the end product, so when you purchase an electric vehicle, you know that you are truly doing your part to protect our environment.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are clearly trying to position themselves for the contract. Also, here is the thing....the biden administration is pushing for \"America first\" and domestic spending, see here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-strengthening-buy-american-provisions-ensuring-future-of-america-is-made-in-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-strengthening-buy-american-provisions-ensuring-future-of-america-is-made-in-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this seems to apply mostly to Federal spending, and I am not sure if it extends any benefits to other companies operating in the US for buying American. Talon seems to be headquarted in Canada, but it has a US subsidiary and the mining project getting huge success for Nickel is in the USA, employing Americans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the next part of my Biden theory:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/biden-replace-entire-federal-fleet-electric-vehicles/story?id=75488441](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/biden-replace-entire-federal-fleet-electric-vehicles/story?id=75488441)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBiden wants to replace the entire government fleet with EV...now unfortunately I think this contract may go to someone like ford, which is also why I bought LEAPs for Ford, but thats another story. I know Ford has used cobalt in the past, but Elon is getting away from cobalt for the more friendly Nickel. This wouldn't be the first time Elon drove industry to do something so I wouldn't be surprised if we see more automakers start to shift towards Nickel, and Talon is positioned right here in the USA to supply the Nickel to manufacturers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is some big news regarding Talon's US based Nickel mining project:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/talon-metals-drills-thick-intercept-120000166.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/talon-metals-drills-thick-intercept-120000166.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically they just found a bunch of top quality nickel in high supply. Here is a video explaining how they mine it, how they want to break into EV battery industry, and how they are environmentally and socially responsible:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gste7lQQCcE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gste7lQQCcE)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are driving as hard as they possible can to be the winner of any contracts for supplying Nickel to US made electric vehicles (which biden really wants!), and we all know that shit is about to pop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a recent interview with the CEO, where he says the drills are turning faster than they can write the PR's, and that much news is set to come over the next month and 6 months:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=hWw3KDm9lzA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=hWw3KDm9lzA)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is more you can research and I didn't really touch on the financials. They are not profiitable YET, but I think with their new discoveries in the Tamarack Mine and the giant push for EV's is going to make this a good long term hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not the first to mention this but I was looking for EV / Nickel stocks and this seems to be very well positioned. Time will tell.",

Ever seen the images of the unimaginable amounts of trash that are produced every year and end up in our landfills, rivers, lakes, oceans, etc.? It seems hopeless at times, but fear not there IS a clean solution to our garbage problem although it needs our support and this stock is one entry into this opportunity at its basement!\n\nIf you are serious about wanting to find a clean waste solution to invest in, I HIGHLY suggest reading this whole thing and diving into some research of your own. Even if you don't give a fuck about it, this is still a great opportunity for getting in extremely cheap on something that could blow UP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **WHO IS THE COMPANY?**\n\n**-$XLPI** is a company that has always been focused on discovering and developing clean energy solutions. \n\n\\- They were founded in 1999 and began being traded on the OTC in 2004 before being taken off the OTC for several years and then was reinstated to the OTC within the last year. \n\n\\- Their past business endeavors included developing ethanol solutions to convert gas powered vehicles into clean fuel alternative vehicles, creating glycerin-based fuel derived from biodiesel production that could replace coal, and hydrogen energy solutions (like $PLUG and $FCEL). \n\n\\- However, I will not sugar coat it, they could never really find a niche in these industries, whether it had to do with timing, execution, past leadership, subsidies, etc. is up for debate. \n\n\\- Needless to say, overall these business endeavors were unsuccessful. However, none of these past endeavors are the reasons I am writing this post, nor do they spark my interest in this particular instance. \n\n\\-The reason I am writing this post is because I believe they are setting themselves up for the imminent \"Green Revolution\" due to a disruptive technology in the waste management and energy industry, called \"Plasma Gasification\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **WHAT IS PLASMA GASIFICATION?**\n\n\\- Some of you might be familiar with this process already if you got into Pyrogenesis ($PYRNF) when it blew up summer 2020. However, for those of you not familiar, Plasma Gasification is the process of taking waste (municipal garbage, tires, plastics, sewage sludge, anything you can name that gets thrown away) and turning it into electricity and biofuel. \n\n\\- The roughly .02% of remnants that cannot be converted into electricity or biofuel can be repurposed into asphalt and concrete for road construction. (If you want a more in depth breakdown on this process I suggest watching [this Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VquomoGn4zk&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks) and also watching this [Technical Breakdown by NRG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBqx8t-YLrw&amp;ab_channel=3Rsoluciones). \n\n\\- It is a 99.9% clean process, compared to landfills that are essentially 100% filthy. \n\n**-Some facts about our waste:** \n\n1. In 2018, there were about 292.4 million TONS of municipal waste produced by the US alone. Of that 292.4 million tons, about 146 million tons ended up in landfills [according to EPA estimates](https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials). \n2. The average US cost per ton to have waste put in a landfill is $55 [according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/692063/cost-to-landfill-municipal-solid-waste-by-us-region/). \n3. Crunch some quick numbers (146 million tons x $55 per ton) and you will find that landfilling is upwards of an 8 billion dollar industry in the US (not including recycling, composting, etc.) \n4. Landfills are a huge greenhouse gas problem, they emit copious amounts of CO2 and methane every year and are the third largest producer of methane worldwide (Methane is 21x worse than CO2). Despite the EPAs implementation of restrictions over the years in an effort to reduce these emissions, the problem is still not being solved and will only continue to get worse as the population grows, i.e. amount of waste will grow. \n5. The bottom line is landfills are disgusting and always will be, there's no real way to make them clean, and that is why I believe Plasma Gasification is the obvious alternative. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Plasma Gasification could prove to be an extremely disruptive technology; the thing that has held it back most since its conception is: MONEY.** \n\n\\- There have never been enough subsidies to truly bring this technology into the forefront and we have not seen its real capabilities, YET. \n\n\\- This could all change with the Biden Green New Deal as trillions of dollars will be directed toward clean/green solutions. \n\n\\- Although creating plasma gasifiers presents a moderately sized up front cost, it will actually EVENTUALLY become CHEAPER to have your waste put into a plasma gasifier than it would to have put in a landfill! So putting money over the environment is not really a debate here, as it will eventually pay for itself. \n\n\\-  This technology is still relatively new (compared to the alternatives) and its full capabilities are yet to be fully realized. Once Plasma Gasification reaches higher levels of efficiency through more R&amp;D (Research and Development) from growing interest and subsidies, it has the theoretical capabilities of [producing more energy than wind, solar, landfills gases, and geothermal forces COMBINED](https://www.energydigital.com/smart-energy/plasma-gasification-turns-waste-energy)!!! (last lines of the article)\n\n\\- Another reason I believe this process is a no brainer is because NOBODY has to change their lifestyle. We often see people campaigning for changing your lifestyle to reduce your output of trash (which is GREAT and something we should all do, but lets face it - thats not going to happen).\n\n   \\- What I mean by this is that you will not have to do anything different than just take your   \ngarbage cans up to your drive way and let the garbage truck take it away, like we always have   \ndone. HOWEVER, instead of that trash being dumped in a landfill it will instead be taken to a   \nGasifier to be cleanly disposed and repurposed. (It creates a feedback loop)\n\n\\- Essentially, by us investing in Plasma gasification as a nation/world we would be investing in our future generation's and the planets health and isn't that what investing is all about at its roots? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **WHY I THINK $XLPI COULD BE SUCCESSFUL**\n\n\\- They have made key moves in the past 8 months and have done a complete makeover of their business model and leadership structure. I believe it is these moves that are setting themselves up to be extremely successful in the growing clean energy/waste industry. \n\n1. Perhaps the most important change they have made comes with their change in leadership. They named a new CEO and President in July, Dr. Charles J. Robinson. Robinson is a former executive for IBM, worked at BMC Software, and worked at CA Technologies as a Senior Software Developer. Along with that he also has five years of experience investing in crypto and creating energy on the blockchain. \n\n* He wants to bring \"Xcelplus into the distributed ledger space by integrating computer science, economics, finance, and green technology into viable and cutting edge DeFi (decentralized finance) energy platforms\" per their Shareholder letter, delivered September 17th, 2020. Linked here: [https://xcelplusint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/XLPltr.pdf](https://xcelplusint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/XLPltr.pdf) \n\n2. They have made a key acquisition of a company called adaptiveARC in early December, a deal   \nthat was 3 years in the making.\n\n\\- This deal provides them with 4 Plasma Gasifier machines, each capable of taking in 20 tons of   \ntrash per day, which are already in the process of being upgraded to take in 50 tons a day.\n\n\\- Each machine is valued at a fair market price of roughly 3 million dollars! For a rough total of   \n$12 million! \n\n\\- This deal with AdaptiveARC also provides over a billion (!!) in waste management contracts   \nand the option to purchase additional gasifier models, as well as \"other agreements for joint   \nventures and partnership\" [per their shareholder letter.](https://xcelplusint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/XLPltr.pdf)\n\n\\- They also say this is the first of several acquisitions they want to make that have \"disruption   \ncaliber technologies linked with alternative energies and the blockchain\", \n\n[per their shareholder letter.](https://xcelplusint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/XLPltr.pdf)\n\n3. Plasma Gasification will not only create an entry point into waste management (a multi billion   \ndollar industry), but also give an entry point into the energy industry (which is a multi trillion   \ndollar industry). \n\n* If you want any more clarification on their business past, outlook, and future endeavors I suggest looking at their [shareholder letter sent out in September](https://xcelplusint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/XLPltr.pdf) 2020, its relatively short and sweet, and could answer some questions you might have. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finally lets break down some numbers, fundamentals, and comparison to companies in their same realm.** \n\n* [According to Yahoo finance XLPI's market cap is only roughly $300,000.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XLPI/)\n   * In assets alone from the gasifiers they have acquired, that adds up to $12 million!\n   * Add in the billion dollars in waste contracts from their acquisition of AdaptiveARC, we have some real potential here for explosive growth. \n* Pyrogenesis, who is a long standing company with a focus on plasma gasification, has a current market value at $584 million! \n* Even if $XLPI can achieve 5% of Pyrogenesis's market cap, we are still talking a growth in market cap from $300,000 to \\~$29 million!!! (Thats a lot of percentage growth.)\n   * Obviously, $XLPI still has a lot to prove, but the potential is certainly there and you can still get in for about .015 cents! A huge value play in my opinion if you are fine with holding at least a couple of years. \n   * For me this is an investment in my belief of Plasma Gasification's potential and perhaps inevitable adoption as we seek to find clean alternatives to landfills. \n   * This is also an investment in their new CEO, Dr. Charles Robinson, who seems to have a combination of experience and knowledge in Plasma Gasification, as well as the blockchain. \n* Essentially, this company checks two critical boxes for me: a mission that sets out to make the world a better place and people that seem worthy of my investment. \n\nLet me know what you think or if you have any questions I may be able to answer, etc.!\n\nTL;DR: $XLPI provides an extremely cheap entry into a potentially disruptive technology (Plasma Gasification) in a multi billion/ multi trillion dollar industry. \n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, so do your own DD before buying!",

Brick and mortar is dead so the turn to e-commerce is a move away from sudden death and a great growing opportunity, and with the help of talented individuals (Cohen, Amazon dude and such) they can really do this right.\n\nBoth Chewy and GameStop have (had) Cohen on the board and are operating in a growing market catering to a specific kind of customer (with games/e-sports being just as big or perhaps even bigger than pets). \n\nPeople like to be catered to by others that know what they're talking about, which is a growing trend. Remember, Amazon also sells pet products, however, Chewy found a niche and targets these customers directly with their own specific product.\n\nWould you like bread from an official bakery using the best products or would you like prepackaged bread from the factory? The prepackaged food will do fine, but the bread from the bakery is just better. This same analogy can be applied to Amazon v GameStop. Chewy has proven this argument right.\n\nThis, together with the recognizable name, is why I see this trading at around $400 (in a few months/years) which would give it a valuation of around 30b.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c for multiple years for me.

        "selftext": "Every time I see another pump article on the \u201cnext Chinese Tesla\u201d because deliveries, I get triggered and have to put on chilled cow on spotify for 3 hours. Although entertaining, \u201cNIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!\u201d comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it\u2019s cold AF outside.\n\nSo I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG &amp; LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don\u2019t like these stocks.\n\n**1. Positions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img kurgz1t5dyg61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly today. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.\n\n**2. The Chosen Ones: NIO &amp; XPENG**\n\nDid you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.\n\nCurrent PS as of 2/10/2021\n\n\\- TSLA: \\~25\n\n\\- NIO: \\~40\n\n\\- XPENG: \\~41\n\n\\- LI: \\~19 (It\u2019s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)\n\nLet\u2019s compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let\u2019s look at high margin tech anyways.\n\n* NFLX: \\~10\n* ABNB: \\~28\n* PLTR: \\~72 (peter pan stock)\n\nActual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma\u2019s teets\n\n\\- TM: \\~0.8\n\n\\- F: \\~0.4\n\n\\- VWAGY: \\~0.5\n\nI did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don\u2019t ask me how I did that, the answer either won\u2019t impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what\u2019s important right now.\n\nQ1 2021 PS if MC doesn\u2019t change\n\n\\- TSLA: \\~22\n\n\\- NIO: \\~29\n\n\\- XPENG: \\~26\n\n\\- LI: \\~14\n\nYep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct &gt;20% because of some black swan (I mean it\u2019s 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nSome other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.\n\nCan they grow Revenues though? Let's look.\n\n**3. Revenue Growth Stunted**\n\nYou might be one of those Stocktwats and you\u2019re thinking; \u201cbut but... they\u2019ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!\u201d \\*Smacks you in the face\\*, no they won\u2019t and here is why.\n\nChinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They\u2019re not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn\u2019t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.\n\nWhy does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you\u2019re not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug\u2019s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.\n\nTSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you\u2019re not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?\n\nNIO: 100% SUVs\n\nXpeng: 40% SUVs\n\nBrand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking \u201cWell, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.\u201d Fine, let\u2019s take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVsTesla Model Y- Price: \\~$52,800\n\n\\- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s\n\n\\- Charger network: 20,000+\n\nNIO EC6\n\n\\- Price: \\~$57,200\n\n\\- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \\~$9k for a bigger battery)\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s\n\n\\- Charger network: 290+\n\nXpeng G3 520\n\n\\- Price: \\~$30,580\n\n\\- Range: 520 km\n\n\\- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s\n\n\\- Charger network: 866+\n\nYou may be thinking the G3 520\u2019s price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you\u2019ll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.\n\n\u201cBut JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It\u2019s perfect for China\u2019s dense cities!\u201d If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That\u2019s why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I\u2019d rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can\u2019t even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I\u2019m Chinese and know some first hand) don\u2019t want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.\n\nBack to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still reading Robinhood as a picture book.\n\nLastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla\u2019s network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.\n\n\u201cBut JJ\u2026 China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!\u201d Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.\n\nSolar &amp; batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn\u2019t make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.Oh and let\u2019s not forget about autonomy\u2026 no, let\u2019s forget about it (for now).\n\nInternational expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a [\"made in china\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rILKm-DC06A) EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.\n\nBack to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it\u2019ll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.\n\n**4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**\n\nHistory lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was [\u201cmade in china\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rILKm-DC06A) at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).\n\nLet\u2019s look at the current state of margins.\n\nQ3 2020 Gross Margins\n\n\\- Tesla: 23.5%\n\n\\- Nio: 12.9%\n\n\\- Xpeng: 4.6%\n\n\\- Li Auto: 19.8%\n\nWe\u2019ll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it\u2019s not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla\u2019s solar &amp; battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \\[redacted\\] at $400.\n\n\u201cBut JJ, that\u2019s not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!\u201d First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier \u201cramp\u201d years.\n\n2017: 18.9%\n\n2016: 22.8%\n\n2015: 22.8%\n\nThis may not look right, something must be wrong you\u2019re thinking. Well, let\u2019s we take a look under the hood, you won\u2019t find Trayvon Martin.\n\n\\- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the \u201cskateboard\u201d design, saying it\u2019s obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!\n\n\\- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 72et2w9ddyg61...*\n\n\\- Tesla\u2019s electronics are industry leading, [Mario knows](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-sandy-munro-analyst-data-video/). Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.\n\n\\- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron\u2019s fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand [abandoned plans to make their own factory](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors) due to cash shortage and [partnered with JAC](https://cntechpost.com/2020/12/05/how-does-nio-build-cars/). A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.\n\n\\- You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins, EVs have some of that too.\n\n\\- In car entertainment: Tesla is building an app store, while Nio and Xpeng outsources\n\n\\- EV Charging: Tesla has the biggest network, Nio has $ losing battery swap, while Xpeng relied on and pays government network\n\n\\- Connectivity: Startlink? \\*shrugs\\*\n\n\\- Autonomous driving: Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD, and I wouldn\u2019t trust Nio and Xpeng\u2019s software with your wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s life\n\n**5. Closing**\n\nLook, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let\u2019s not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride. Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks, when buyers have a paradox of choice, the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand, guess who?\n\nCCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.\n\nI\u2019m no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it\u2019s peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I\u2019ll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.\n\nAt the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I\u2019ve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.\n\nTL;DR Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng. Better to sit on the side lines for Tesla and Li Auto",

        "selftext": "## **The CCIV play 2/16/2021 [DD]; hot &amp; volatile but great $$$!**\n\n**Overview**\n\nCCIV is in talks to bring Lucid Motors public via a reverse merger. Lucid Motors is basically a luxury Tesla. Its founders include the chief engineer &amp; principal designers of the Tesla Model S. It's widely regarded as a very hot EV company. CCIV has $2B+ in money.\n\n**More on Lucid Motors**\n\n- Founded in 2007 by the Chief Engineer &amp; designers of the Tesla Model S\n- 1600 total employees, **15.5%** of which have previously worked at Tesla!!\n- Flagship model: 2021 Lucid Air. **517-mile range** and up to **1080 horsepower**. Price is between $70k to $169k\n- Lucid Air will have the highest range of any EV currently available on the market.\n- $700M vehicle production facility recently opened in Arizona. Production numbers expected: 34,000/yr for the Lucid Air.\n\nLucid is a solid EV company. It's not a guarantee it'll be the next Tesla (there's no Elon Musk behind it), but overall very solid EV.\n\nNow, the question is: will it merge with CCIV?\n\n**Lucid ownership**\n\n- 67% Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). The PIF bought 67% worth of Lucid for $1.3b in 2019.\n- ??% Company float, founders, executives, etc\n- ??% Venture Capital: Venrock, China Environmental Fund, Jafco, Mitsui &amp; Co\n\ntldr: A very large portion is owned by the PIF. CCIV would most likely purchase the needed % from the Venture Capital investors (VCs).\n\n## **Lucid Motors' Chairman of the Board is also an Operating Partner at Churchill Capital IV!**\n\nSurprise, surprise! Andrew Liveris is Lucid Motors' Chairman of the Board. That means he's the boss of the Board of Directors. A company's \"board of directors\" are the CEO's bosses.\n\nHe has deep ties to Saudi Arabia, and is a special advisor at the PIF. Guess how Lucid was able to obtain that $1.3b investment in 2019? Thanks to Mr. Liveris.\n\nHe also just happens to be an Operating Partner at CCIV. The same CCIV that is in talks to bring Lucid public. Andrew is on both sides of the deal. I don't think this is a coincidence.\n\nIn fact, Andrew is on all 3 sides of the deal: Lucid, Churchill, and the PIF.\n\n## **Michael Klein is an \"important advisor\" to the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF)!**\n\nAnother surprise. They're all in bed with each other! Michael Klein is considered an \"important adviser\" to the PIF.\n\nMichael Klein has a **very rich history of helping the Saudi kingdom** on many deals.\n\nThis article goes into the Saudi-Klein background &amp; deals: https://www.finews.asia/people/30652-michael-klein-the-middle-east-expert-at-credit-suisse-asia\n\n\n## **Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed Bin Salman**\n\nTo keep it short: the Prince has stated many times that he'd like to move the Kingdom away from its dependence on oil to becoming something of a high-tech hub.\n\n\n## **Andrew Liveris &amp; Michael Klein have done a $130 billion-dollar deal together!**\n\nHoly shit, if this isn't the mother of all surprises so far.\n\nAndrew Liveris is the former Chairman and CEO of the Dow Jones company. In 2015, the Dow Jones company awarded Michael Klein a leading role on its $130b merger with DuPont.\n\nThis article dives into the deal &amp; the Liveris-Klein relationship: https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-dow-m-a-klein/dow-ceo-rewards-former-citi-banker-klein-with-130-billion-deal-prize-idUKKBN0TU2UH20151211 \n\n\n**Great! So what *has* has happened so far?**\n\nRumors, and a lot of \"leaks from Bloomberg and the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\n- Feb 12: Bloomberg Terminal updates with note suggesting Venrock-led consortium in talks with CCIV\n- Jan 19: Lucid releases job postings only needed for a public company (SEC reporting manager, director of IR)\n- Jan 11: Bloomberg news release says \"transaction valued up to $15 billion\" so as to test how the market would react. The markets reacted positively.\n\n\n**So what's the takeaway!?**\n\nAndrew Livertis is the Chairman of the Board at Lucid Motors. Andrew is also an operating partner at CCIV. And Andrew is also a special adviser to the PIF, and likely spearheaded the $1.3b investment in 2019.\n\nMichael Klein heads CCIV. Klein has even deeper ties to Saudi Arabia, and has helped the Kingdom throughout many deals and banking situations.\n\nAndrew Livertis and Michael Klein have done a massive** $130B deal** together.\n\nEveryone is deeply inter-connected and have done deals much bigger than Lucid in the past.\n\nIt's almost a no-brainer that this merger will happen, and it will get done. CCIV is happening, Lucid will be getting reverse merged and listed on an exchange.\n\n-------------\n\n**Sources**\n\n- Lucid Motors Board of Directors (Andrew Liveris): https://www.lucidmotors.com/company/board/\n- CCIV Operating Partners: https://iv.churchillcapitalcorp.com/operating-partners/\n- Lucid Motor's new Arizona factory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy6Lcz7CsQY\n- Saudi Arabia PIF ownership https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302524/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-pif-investment-majority-shareholder\n- Venture Capital investments https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/atieva/company_financials\n- Bloomberg jan 11 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac\n- Michael Klein &amp; big deals: https://www.finews.asia/people/30652-michael-klein-the-middle-east-expert-at-credit-suisse-asia\n\n---------\n\n*Disclosure: I own ~11000 shares of CCIV*\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*",

        "selftext": "Mods ... respectfully requesting you do not delete this post as it pertains to two OTC stocks, $FNMA and $FMCC.  However, they are only artificially held on OTC by the US Treasury and FHFA for the reasons being argued in the Supreme Court in Collins v. Treasury.  Hear me out, please \u2014 there is a timing component to this investment thesis.\n\nFreddie Mac ($FMCC) [announced](http://www.freddiemac.com/investors/financials/pdf/2020er-4q20_release.pdf) $7.3B in net income for 2020 earlier today.\nFannie Mae ($FNMA) announces earnings tomorrow (2/12).\n\nThe question I pose for discussion is whether the two GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are some of the deepest fucking values hiding in plain sight? \n\nTLDR: Deep value in GSEs; SCOTUS ruling (coming in days) will have significant impact. [Ackman thinks](https://youtu.be/MBSug5ftggY) of Pershing Square this could have 600x potential.  \n\nYeah, at first look you see OTC and cringe \u2014 I know I do.  But, once you start to understand the history of what happened in 2008 when the government placed these two entities into conservatorship, you start to realize \u2014 holy shit, the basis for the conservatorship was false and the government self-dealed in 2012 by implementing the net worth sweep, and in implementing the net worth sweep is not fulfilling its duty as conservator.  And, these companies are cash machines \u2014 *they basically print money!!!* The earnings speak for themselves.\n\nIt really is an amazing story with lots of twist and turns, but finally the time has come. One of the shareholder lawsuits, the aforementioned Collins, was heard by SCOTUS on 12/9/2020 and WILL BE decided before this session closes in June. I think the average opinion is issued in 84 days, but don\u2019t quote me on that; in any case, the clock is ticking.  Why do I think so highly of SCOTUS in Collins, see Seila Law decided in June 2020; they\u2019ve already set the precedent.\n\nLook, I said this story is long \u2014 it\u2019s a saga, an epic.  There are a lot, a whole lot of details I haven\u2019t mentioned \u2014 you don\u2019t have the time, nor do I.  But, Michael Kao and Tim Pagliara were recently on [this podcast](https://www.realvision.com/identifying-sound-anti-bubble-trades-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-live-with-michael-kao-and-tim-pagliara) discussing all the in and outs. If I peaked your interest, watch the video, or better yet \u2014 go listen to the oral arguments from the 12/9/20 SCOTUS hearing. \n\nI have been long on $FNMA since 2010. GLTA",
