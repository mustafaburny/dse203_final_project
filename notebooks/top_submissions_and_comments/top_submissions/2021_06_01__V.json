        "selftext": "&gt;The Federal Reserve will soon begin selling off the corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds it amassed last year through an emergency-lending vehicle set up to contain the Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s economic fallout.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The vehicle, known as the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, or SMCCF, held $5.21 billion of bonds from companies including Whirlpool Corp. , Walmart Inc. and Visa Inc. as of April 30. In addition, it held $8.56 billion of exchange-traded funds that hold corporate debt, such as the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Fed official said the sales should be completed by the end of this year. Net proceeds will be remitted to the Treasury Department.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Fed\u2019s corporate-debt holdings are distinct from its $7.3 trillion balance sheet of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. The central bank is continuing to purchase those types of assets to the tune of at least $120 billion a month as part of its monetary-policy goal of holding down borrowing costs until the economy recovers further from the pandemic.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Fed added that its corporate-bond and ETF sales \u201cwill aim to minimize the potential for any adverse impact on market functioning by taking into account daily liquidity and trading conditions\u201d for ETFs and corporate bonds.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-plans-to-sell-13-7-billion-of-corporate-bonds-etfs-by-year-end-11622666400?mod=hp\\_lead\\_pos3](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-plans-to-sell-13-7-billion-of-corporate-bonds-etfs-by-year-end-11622666400?mod=hp_lead_pos3)",

        "selftext": "Let's dig in to the new BlackBerry IVY and it's possibilities and the system in general. But first let's touch base on the fact that BlackBerry and Amazon are no stranger to partnerships between the each other. In fact BlackBerry collaborated with Amazon all the way back in 2015 when Amazon integrated it's App store into BB10 devices which were run on QNX.\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what is BlackBerry IVY? It is a multi-year agreement with Amazon Web Services(AWS). We can look at it as cloud platform for automotive industry to have vehicles exchanging information with one another as well as the passenger, automotive manufacturers, operators and even the grid of a smart connected city. \ud83d\ude80\n\nLet's start with the advantages of being connected to the manufacturer. We have already seen this in other EV's and unsecured technologically advanced vehicle platforms. This ability can help the manufacturer identify problems over the air and rectify them with secure updates or even issuing a message to the driver about the need to have something brought in to be looked at. For example a vehicle recall, battery replacement/upgrade, tire monitoring systems and more. \ud83d\ude80\n\nNow being connected to the passenger allows the system to deliver unique interactive cockpit experiences designed by the automotive brand and developers all while your vehicle drives you to work or even taxis others around while you're at work. It does this using vehicle data sensors and analytics to customize the users experience. \ud83d\ude80\n\nEnabling fleet operators with BlackBerry IVY unlocks the potential for massive improvements in logistics and asset tracking, BlackBerry already sells asset tracking devices for fleet operators and is currently collecting and improving efficiencies for any operators utilizing it's system by using data analytics and sensors.\ud83d\ude80\n\nIf the system is connected to the grid, this unlocks a massive opportunity to increase city and traffic efficiencies. Ever get stuck at a red light with no traffic coming in any direction? Now imagine lights turning green for a single vehicle or monitoring traffic and allowing heavier traffic to be given precedence at a intersection.\ud83d\ude80\n\nV2V (vehicle to vehicle) communication will allow cars ahead of you to mark pot holes or warn other vehicles of the dangers ahead. Not only this but in autonomy V2V communication can allow possibilities like convoying with vehicles and drafting off each other bumper to bumper on a congested highway. What if the car in front of you stops? Each vehicle will know what will be happening with the vehicle in front of you, it will know anytime the other vehicles change speeds or engage the brakes. This could allow vehicles to travel safely more fluently.\ud83d\ude80\n\nTL;DR Basically IVY will improve efficiencies in a smart city, for operators, manufacturers and also increase personal productivity. It will do this by allowing you to get things done in your car and spending less time on the road and in traffic. It will enable this while maintaining the freedom and ability to operate the vehicle yourself. Or if you work 9-5 or have a road trip you can sit back be entertained, relax and eventually even sleep while your vehicle takes you places. They already have a patent for autonomous refueling which highlights the ability to be able to go anywhere and not get distracted by your travels. \ud83d\ude80\n\n [YouTube | BlackBerry IVY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwDnUNENSoY)",

        "selftext": "This will probably be buried maybe deleted as I am a lurker and could be taken wrong and accused of spreading FUD as I don't contribute to discussions here and only lurk. I am just so frustrated with what happened today and the discussions I have been seeing that I sent a few comments and now honestly just need to vent, maybe someone can get something out of this retard's ramblings or we can have a discussion about any of what is below without attacking one another, maybe it will only help one person and that is fine it is better than saying nothing at all.\n\nPeople who have been here for awhile probably will find little value in this post but who knows maybe you will. Hell, newer people probably wont either but it could be useful to think about some of what I have to say who knows I did too much brick red shit is getting weird.\n\n***Keep in mind obviously I am retarded and my opinion is terrible, do not read further. I sniff glue, and none of this is financial advice all it is meant to do is engage your brain to think about things before picking sides or spreading information that could cause harm. Also, Excuse my grammar its worse than my investment strategy.***\n\nI am generally curious to hear thoughts about the current situation in both what happened to AMC today or anything related to it, and I guess just general thoughts surrounding both BB and AMC without shitting on the other with misinformation and FUD. It is starting to look like a BB vs AMC brawl at the moment with AMC getting shit on for a terrible misguided reason. I don't know how many people are actually contributing to said shit but ***ignorance breeds FUD.***\n\nI am not going to attack people investing in BB or anyone talking bad about AMC or vice versa because everyone is entitled to their own opinion and can say and invest in whatever they want to, I just hope you can think about both sides and research into it yourself before doing so at the least. Honestly, I believe that both companies have potential, I lean more toward AMC because I know more about it  (which is not much because again I am retarded) not because BB is terrible or a dumb investment I just do not know much about it so I will not have a strong opinion on it. I will however be looking into it tonight because more knowledge is always a positive. The more we educate ourselves, the better decisions we can make. That being said I think AMC is being shit on a little harder because of the FUD that happened today with AMC price and the media's pushing of BB and spreading AMC FUD as well. Paperhands more than likely contributed heavily today with short attacks to suppress AMC gainz but this is just speculation.\n\nAMC's sold shares to Murdock 2 days ago and also some to the market today and it is being blown way out of proportion in a negative fashion which in all honesty it could very well be very advantageous to retail's gainz. On the surface that statement sounds insane to most people who do not know much about the stock market or business operations in general. If you look up information directly from AMC and try to understand what was actually done and why it was done and logically think about it instead of trusting others 100%, Today could have played out very differently. I'm not saying it was a terrible day by any means just stating that it possibly could have been better if FUD could have been spotted and stamped out by retail more efficiently by thinking for themselves and not relying on others most of the time. \n\n**Retail needs to be VERY cautious when reading about ANY news they hear about the market, retail has completely flipped the market upside down and media will be a huge factor in trying to get retail \"back in line\" we have seen it happening for months. There is and will also be more retail to flock to these stocks that will drive volatility higher which means retail must not accidently spread FUD and learn to think for themselves based on data and facts given. If we do not think for ourselves a little more, and be more skeptical about what we hear, less tendies will be had.** \n\nThe 20m shares that got issued were going to go into the Outstanding shares regardless if they sold them to the market. The shares were going to be given to the executives of AMC for their personal benefit, instead they used these shares to secure capital to be used in the future benefit of AMC and thus retail, the shareholders. They gave up personal gain to have more capital infused into AMC, this to me is very good news. The only way shorts do not have to cover is AMC going bankrupt which capital they gained from those shares helps to avoid. **These shares were basically going to be a bonus that AMC executives refused in order to give it to the company.** Think about all that has happened to AMC, then think about what you hear happen at failing companies and what their executives do before said company goes tits up. Ill give you a hint they usually dont try to decline bonuses to help the company. Granted you could argue they are nowhere near close to claiming bankruptcy, but even so more than anything I think it proves that they actually give a shit and are grateful to retail for saving their ass, then I must have ate too many crayons.\n\nAbout the \"dilution\" problem, think about it logically. Do you think that roughly 20m shares that were added on two different days with \\~480M and \\~590m volume on the days in question, to a share count that is already somewhere around 500M that is roughly 80% owned by retail already is fucking us over? If you think it does, is it really enough to jump ship / spread FUD? It could be, who knows, but my retarded brain thinks otherwise. I am not telling you what to think but rather to actually think about it/ research it and come to your own conclusion. Even if you have no interest in investing in AMC spreading negative things about it only hurts the other so called \"meme\" stocks that directly correlate to it.\n\nAMC no longer has any shares to sell they have 46k shares left, which means retail will have the final say on any vote in shareholder meetings as they own the majority of shares and AMC can not \"dilute\" the outstanding shares if you believe that is actually what they have been doing with ill intent. They want to have the ability to issue 25m shares and given the circumstances that AMC just survived I think it is a good idea to have that option in their back pocket as they literally don't have to use them unless needed. **I am not telling you that you should believe what I believe.** I know a majority of retail might not agree with my opinion and that is completely fine I just want some thought to be put into it, think about it and research it yourself. If you come to the same conclusion then vote against it in the meeting. **Retail will have final say in the deal so we must be educated about any matter like this that may come to a vote**. This deal might be completely irrelevant in fact it probably is but who knows it is better to be prepared so an informed decision can take place. Retail literally has final say in decisions that can effect an entire multi billion dollar company. What Retail decides in any vote will effect the company and in turn each of the individual investments in it. Give it some effort\n\nWe all know what happened today with AMC price (6/3/2021). I Don't think it was the best day ever by any means but it was not all that bad. Considering the circumstances with the confusion that happened throughout the day with shares being sold by AMC, especially when you factor in new investors who are not yet accustomed to the FUD seen everyday ***Midday was was one fucking hell of a ride.***  We should think about the positives of today as well as the negatives instead of focusing mainly on the latter. I think today was nowhere near as bad as what some would think.\n\nOne final note, The live stream of AMC's CEO Adam Aron answering questions Is one of the main reasons I will continue to support AMC. **In my own personal opinion** I am extremely hyped for what is going to happen tomorrow. I could be completely wrong but it seems like He knows what the hell he is doing and he actually gives a shit. I know there is an argument that could be made that it was all an act because of retails majority share ownership. I just don't get that vibe from him, the man sounded like is taking us seriously or at least that he actually is taking steps to understand retail as best as possible in order to make decisions we would support as a majority. If you have not watched it yet I would recommend doing so if you are interested or are already invested in AMC. **Remember there are legalities that a CEO has to follow which could account for some of the things being said by Adam. I did not look into this but it is something to consider if something seems off, that doesn't mean that everything that seems fishy is because of this.**\n\nI'm not going to end with some speech about holding the line or be proud. Just give thought to everything you see, be skeptical and do some research. The more of this that occurs the better off retail is as a whole, and the better off you as an individual will be in securing your tendies.\n\nAnything said above was for the purpose of discussion and getting people to really give it some thought and effort before believing/spreading everything that seems like it is true or that you want to be true.\n\nTLDR: Ignore entire wall of text and watch Adam Aron answer [Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-EkPZMIAeM) then maybe read above if not just try being more skeptical of everything and put the research and thought into your actions. Effort will be what makes the difference. Emotions are peaking and it important we stay vigilant.",

This post is an abridged version of a longer report (with charts!) that you can find as a PDF below.\n\nUranium bulls will already be familiar with pretty much everything I cover, so this is designed to be a comprehensive, well-sourced introduction to the fundamentals of the uranium market and an assessment of the bull thesis that an imminent supply shortage will drive up the spot price of uranium and initiate a new long-term contracting cycle between mining companies and utilities. I hope some of you find this helpful in your own research.\n\n[PDF link](https://pdfhost.io/v/61x7l6B9E_Assessment_of_the_Uranium_Market_and_Future_Outlook.pdf)\n\n# Assessment of the Uranium Market and Future Outlook\n\n**Disclaimer and disclosure:** I am not a financial advisor and none of the below research constitutes investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell. Always do your own due diligence. I currently have small positions in some of the securities mentioned.\n\n**Note:** Any constructive criticism to improve this DD would be welcome. If you see any red flags or risks I may have missed, please highlight them.\n\n# Highlights\n\n* After a decade-long bear market spurred by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, positive sentiment of uranium and nuclear energy is improving. The construction of new reactors is on the rise, particularly in Asia, and nuclear energy is increasingly seen as essential to helping countries meet their decarbonization targets.\n* After Fukushima, uranium supply flooded the market and demand fell, particularly in Japan and Germany, leading to low uranium prices for years. In response to these tough market conditions, mining companies have scaled back production in an attempt to balance a market saturated with the metal. Low uranium prices have also prevented miners from committing to large-scale investments in new mining projects, resulting in uncertainty in future supply.\n* Uranium is primarily sold not on the open market but through private, long-term contracts. But given an oversupply of uranium and cheap prices on the spot market, contracted volume has been low for several years as utilities and reactor operators draw on the secondary supply, such as purchasing on the spot market, to make up the deficit between what is delivered through older contracts and what reactors require to keep running.\n* But as the secondary supply dwindles and miners maintain production discipline, utilities will face a projected supply shortage and will eventually be incentivized to enter into long-term contracts at higher prices. Furthermore, recent physical uranium purchases from junior miners and investment funds\u2014a new development for the market\u2014signal growing investor interest in the metal and put additional pressure on a limited supply.\n* Optimistic investors, market analysts, and industry CEOs largely believe the bear market is ending and a new uranium bull market is emerging. They predict that in the coming decade, demand is set to grow as supply tightens, and as a result, uranium prices will rise (indeed, *must* rise) to incentivize new mining production and fill demand.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThis report examines the current uranium market and the thesis that, as demand for nuclear energy grows and supply dwindles, utilities will have to sign new long-term contracts for uranium delivery, causing the price of uranium to increase and initiate a new bull market. While this report covers the uranium market, the politics of nuclear energy, and upcoming catalysts, it does not analyze any specific uranium stocks nor does it recommend any particular investment strategies.\n\nLike most mineral commodity markets, uranium has a history of volatility and typically moves with supply and demand as well as geopolitical forces. For context, in 2017, the world\u2019s top uranium producers were Kazakhstan (39% of world production), Canada (22%), and Australia (10%) with Namibia, Niger, and Uzbekistan playing smaller roles in the market. The largest and most significant uranium [exploration and mining companies](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx) include state-owned Kazatomprom (22% of world production), France\u2019s Orano (11%), Cameco (9%), Uranium One (8%), and CNNC (7%). Finally, the [most productive uranium mine](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/uranium-mining-overview.aspx) is Cigar Lake in Canada (owned by Cameco/Orano with 13% of world production). Notably, Cameco\u2019s McArthur River mine, the world\u2019s largest high-grade uranium deposit, was placed under care and maintenance in 2018 due to low uranium prices.\n\nBefore uranium can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors, it goes through a process known as the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle where the uranium is (1) mined and milled into U3O8 (also known as yellowcake, a uranium concentrate powder), (2) converted into UF6, (3) enriched, and then (4) fabricated into fuel. This process is time-consuming and geographically spread out; over the course of 1-2 years, uranium might be mined in Canada, converted and enriched in France, and sent to fuel a reactor in the United States, and utility inventories of uranium might be spread out along this cycle with only a small portion of it immediately ready to fuel a reactor.\n\n# Sentiment on Nuclear Energy\n\nAs [one article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/14/is-denison-mines-stock-a-buy/) puts it, \u201cnuclear power has been something of an unloved stepchild in the energy sector.\u201d Indeed, since the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, public opinion has been focused on safety and environmental concerns. In Europe, Germany has reduced their number of reactors from [17 to 6](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/germany.aspx) (and the remaining six are scheduled to be decommissioned by the end of 2022), with the German public broadly opposed to constructing new reactors. In the U.S., according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as of November 2019, there were [23](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/us-nuclear-industry.php) nuclear power reactors in various stages of decommissioning, with only two new reactors being built.\n\nSo is nuclear energy on its way out? Probably not.\n\nIn France, where 56 reactors operate, officials recently [extended](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/france-extend-lifetime-old-nuclear-102331515.html) the 40-year lifespan of nuclear plants an additional 10 years. In March, China released its 14th 5-year plan, which [aims](https://www.power-technology.com/news/industry-news/china-five-year-plan-three-points-nuclear-coal-energy-efficiency/) for 70GW of power generation through nuclear energy before 2025 (it hit 51GW in 2020), and the country is currently [building](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/china-nuclear-power.aspx) 16 new reactors to meet this goal. In India, 9 new reactors are under construction. In the U.S., described in more detail below, the Biden administration has adopted a positive stance towards nuclear energy, and some U.S. reactors are starting to [receive](https://www.powermag.com/nrc-issues-first-subsequent-license-renewals-extends-nuclear-reactor-life-to-80-years/) license renewals to operate beyond their original lifespan. Nuclear energy, though it can be controversial even among some experts, is increasingly seen as [essential](https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-nuclear-power-must-be-part-of-the-energy-solution-environmentalists-climate) to meeting decarbonization targets. Overall, the number of new reactors is expected to outpace shutdowns, and as a result, the demand for uranium is projected to increase 1-3% per year in the coming decades.\n\n# Market Overview\n\nGlobal demand for uranium rose from the 1950s through the 1970s, largely driven by nuclear weapons procurement programs. Then, in the 1980s, various environmental, safety, and economic concerns over nuclear power plants reduced demand; at the same time, the market was flooded with excess uranium, and prices remained depressed throughout the 1990s. As uranium prices fell, producers began curtailing operations or exiting the business entirely, leaving only a few actively involved in uranium mining and causing uranium inventories to shrink significantly.\n\nUranium prices reached an all-time low in 2001, costing about $7/lb. This was followed by a period of gradual rise (during which three mines either flooded or suffered extreme weather, tightening supply and causing the price to increase further), followed by a bubble culminating in mid-2007, during which the price peaked at around $137/lb. The higher price during the bubble spurred new prospecting and reopening of old mines.\n\nThe Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, however, sparked renewed fears about the safety of nuclear reactors and set in motion a decade-long bear market. Demand fell as Japan took all of their reactors offline, and prices ultimately reached a low of around $18/lb. in November 2016 before hitting about $29/lb. in April 2021. The low price of uranium has caused some mining companies to leave the business entirely, such as Westwater Resources (previously Uranium Resources); by [some estimates](http://uraniumequities.com/uranium-reports/2018/10/Canaccord-Uranium-Time-U-Move.pdf), there were nearly 600 uranium mining companies in 2011, but today there are only about 50.\n\nSignificantly, prices still remain far below the [$50-$60/lb.](https://www.urnmetf.com/posts/uranium-prices-inflection-point) figure often cited as the all-in cost of production (though some companies can produce for much cheaper), and as long as the spot price remains below the cost of production, mining companies will lack incentive to add more uranium to the market, invest in new mines, or engage in higher-cost production. (Some sources distinguish between the all-in cost of production, which Canada\u2019s [Skyharbour Resources](https://skyharbourltd.com/projects/uranium-projects/uranium-overview/) estimates at around $40/lb., and the \u201cincentive price,\u201d estimated at $50-$60/lb., needed to spur meaningful new production.)\n\nAs a result of weak uranium prices and in an effort to reduce available supply, mining companies have strategically cut back on uranium production over the last few years. According to the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-uranium-miners-glow-is-temporary-1512508637?mod=article_inline), in 2017 both Kazatomprom and Cameco, two of the three largest mining companies, reduced or suspended production at uranium mines, and other high-cost mines have been idled or closed down. Further, mines can take more than a decade to plan, build, and begin operation, but low uranium prices make these kinds of large long-term investments financially unsound. As Cameco put it in their [Q1 2021 earnings call](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets-us-west-2/quarterly/CCO-transcript-2021-Q1-call.pdf), \u201cGiven the timelines it takes, we should be investing now to replace that lost production, but at today\u2019s prices, that makes zero sense.\u201d As a result, over the last few years, production of mined uranium (i.e., the primary supply) has not kept up with demand, and utility companies have had to purchase uranium from secondary sources such as the spot market, stockpiles, re-enriched depleted uranium tails, and ex-military weapons-grade uranium to keep their reactors going.\n\nThe vast majority of uranium is not sold on the open market but through private, long-term contracts between buyers (usually utility companies) and sellers (usually mining companies) with delivery typically beginning about two years after the signing of the contract. In addition, the amount delivered can usually be adjusted plus or minus some percent, depending on the utility companies\u2019 needs, and the price to deliver the uranium may be adjusted with changes in the spot market; Cameco, for instance, targets a ratio of 40% fixed-pricing and 60% market-related pricing in their portfolio of long-term contracts. Roughly [76% of U.S.-purchased uranium](https://www.eia.gov/uranium/marketing/table7.php) delivered in 2020 was bought through long-term contracts and about 24% through spot market purchases. (This is actually historically low; in 2006, it was 90% long term, reflecting the fact that utilities have been relying more on spot purchases in recent years.) There is some speculation that the spot price of uranium will begin to rise when utility companies sign new long-term contracts, a scenario discussed in more detail under \u201cLong-term Contracts.\"\n\n## Supply and Demand\n\nTracking the current levels of supply and demand of uranium can be extremely useful for determining if utilities will begin to enter long-term contracts or continue to purchase from the spot market or other sources. So, how much supply of uranium is in the market and how much demand is there for that supply? Roughly speaking, each year, about 175-180 million lbs. of uranium are consumed globally. Of that, about 120 million lbs. are supplied by miners and the rest is made up from secondary supplies and utility inventories. Though the exact size of the secondary market is difficult to estimate, [Uranium 2020: Resources, Production and Demand](https://www.oecd-nea.org/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-12/7555_uranium_-_resources_production_and_demand_2020__web.pdf), a joint report by the Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency, suggests the figure is around 10,000 metric tons per year, or 22 million lbs., suggesting a structural deficit between supply and demand that is made up by drawing on material that utilities already have in inventory.\n\nAs I mentioned above, in recent years, mining companies have been intentionally reducing the primary supply of uranium on the market. Over the past decade, the primary supply has continually fallen short of global demand, causing a deficit that is filled by a limited and, as the thesis goes, dwindling secondary supply. We can see from the [World Nuclear Association](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/uranium-production-figures.aspx) that after the 2017 production cuts, mined uranium only covered about 80% of world demand.\n\nTracking secondary supply is both more difficult and more important as its reserves are a key indicator of when utilities will need to enter into long-term contracts. Secondary supply includes stockpiles and inventories of natural and enriched uranium, both civilian and military in origin; nuclear fuel from the reprocessing of spent reactor fuels and from surplus military plutonium; underfeeding; and uranium produced by the re-enrichment of depleted uranium tails. The World Nuclear Association\u2019s [*Nuclear Fuel Report*](https://www.world-nuclear.org/getmedia/b488c502-baf9-4142-8d12-42bab97593c3/nuclear-fuel-report-2019-expanded-summary-final.pdf.aspx) notes, \u201cThe majority of secondary supplies are derived from uranium that has undergone transformation in reactors, enrichment plants and reprocessing facilities. The second largest potential secondary resource by mass is the world\u2019s inventory of not-yet-treated used nuclear fuel, held largely at reactor sites.\u201d While this inventory normally accounts for only a relatively small portion of total supply, with low uranium prices and limited mining production, this source has become more significant not only for primary producers and utilities but also for traders and holding companies.\n\nBMO Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley have also written research notes [predicting](https://www.mining.com/stars-are-aligning-for-uranium-price-rally/) \u201ca rally in \\[uranium\\] prices over the next few years to the \\~$50 \\[per pound\\] level by 2024.\u201d Importantly, both groups also point to uncertainty surrounding just how long existing inventories will last:\n\n&gt;Morgan Stanley warns that \u201cthe opacity of the inventory situation remains a key uncertainty to price\u2014see for example palladium, which needed almost 7 years of deficit before the price really took off.\u201d BMO says given the still-high levels of inventories, \u201cacute shortages and price squeezes are extremely unlikely, both for this year and the foreseeable future,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no obvious need for new mine supply in the near future.\u201d\n\nThese are important sources of uncertainty that are worth paying attention to. If the uranium bull thesis of an imminent supply deficit ends up being wrong, a miscalculation of existing inventories and market supply will likely be one of the main reasons why (this would, of course, just delay the thesis, if all other factors remained equal). With that said, I somewhat disagree with BMO\u2019s assessment (or maybe just their use of the phrase \u201cnear future\u201d), as there is evidence that new/more primary production will be needed by the middle or end of the decade, meaning companies should be investing in those projects today. Remember, utilities and miners operate on a longer timescale than other markets; they sign contracts for 5-10 years, and a reactor with only two years\u2019 worth of uranium is operating akin to just-in-time delivery.\n\n**Now, what about demand?** According to the [International Atomic Energy Agency](https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/home.aspx), there are currently 443 reactors in operation and 52 under construction. Although these reactors require an established, predictable amount of uranium, demand for the metal can still be difficult to estimate, since delays in the construction of new reactors as well as license renewals of old ones can add complications. In the U.S., reactors require about one-fourth of global demand, about 45 million lbs. per year. In February, Bank of America analyst Lawson Winder [speculated](https://www.barrons.com/articles/uranium-miner-cameco-gets-boost-from-sunnier-outlook-for-nuclear-plants-51612283697) that the planned closure of 12 U.S. nuclear power plants this decade could be postponed beyond 2030, adding 26 million pounds to 2021-2030 uranium demand.\u201d Indeed, license renewal has been a growing topic of interest among nuclear and policy experts (as an example, Virginia\u2019s Surry Power Station was [recently granted](https://apnews.com/article/business-f07aefe6a8f4a2fd2a549113bbf1e925) a 20-year extension and several more U.S. renewals are [under review](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/nuclear-industry-sees-opportunities-in-dc-as-infrastructure-talks-heat-up-64165577); even Japan has given the [green light](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/japan-utility-restart-nuclear-reactors-77365378) to operate three reactors for an additional 20 years, helping reach its goal of having 20-22% of its energy come from nuclear power by 2030). Further, we\u2019ve also seen reports that the Biden administration supports subsidies for nuclear plants to prevent them from closing, and Biden\u2019s climate adviser [supports](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/white-house-climate-adviser-says-existing-nuclear-essential-reach-emissions-2021-05-18/) the continued operation of existing nuclear reactors to achieve emissions goals\u2014more on this under \u201cPolitical and Policy Developments.\u201d Winder adds that a shift \u201ccould lead U.S. fuel buyers to move forward plans for major new contracting: Consider that those 26 million pounds are 23% of total U.S. utility inventories at year-end 2019 of 113 million pounds, and inventories today are quite likely lower post 2020\u2019s supply disruptions.\u201d If reactors are kept online longer than expected, utilities would only face greater urgency to sign new contracts for nuclear fuel.\n\n## Political and Policy Developments\n\n## United States\n\nIn the United States, throughout his tenure, President Trump exhibited a positive stance towards nuclear energy. In 2018, two U.S. uranium miners, Energy Fuels Inc and Ur-Energy Corporation, filed a Section 232 petition, essentially asking the government to investigate national security concerns regarding foreign uranium imports and asking that 25% of U.S. uranium consumption be met by U.S. producers. Though the Trump administration [ultimately rejected](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/US-President-rejects-uranium-import-restrictions) this petition, it established the Nuclear Fuel Working Group to find alternative solutions to \u201crestore American nuclear energy leadership.\u201d Framed as a way to increase national security and revitalize domestic uranium production, the Working Group [aimed](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/04/f74/Restoring%20America%27s%20Competitive%20Nuclear%20Advantage-Blue%20version%5B1%5D.pdf) to \u201crestore America\u2019s competitive nuclear \\[energy\\] advantages\u201d and recommended, among other initiatives, to \u201cdirectly purchase uranium by establishing a uranium reserve.\u201d In December 2020, Congress passed the [Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021](https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf) to fund the government through fiscal year 2021, which set aside $75 million for the Uranium Reserve Program, but the project is still in the early stages and it does not appear that any uranium purchases have actually been made by the U.S. government. (More information on the nuclear- and uranium-related provisions of the 2021 appropriations law can be found [here](https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Congress-approves-nuclear-energy-funding-for-FY202).)\n\nThe Biden administration has taken a similarly positive stance towards uranium and nuclear energy. Though there hasn\u2019t been much headline news on the topic, nuclear energy is included in one of the objectives of the [American Jobs Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/) to leverage \u201ccarbon pollution-free energy provided by existing sources like nuclear and hydropower\u201d and to manufacture \u201ccritical technologies like advanced nuclear reactors and fuel.\u201d Separately, Reuters recently [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/white-house-eyes-subsidies-nuclear-plants-help-meet-climate-targets-sources-2021-05-05/), \u201cThe White House has signaled privately to lawmakers and stakeholders in recent weeks that it supports taxpayer subsidies to keep nuclear facilities from closing and making it harder to meet U.S. climate goals.\u201d Biden\u2019s recently [proposed 2022 budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/budget_fy22.pdf), which will likely change before being signed into law, requests $9.75 billion in credits for \u201celectricity generation from existing nuclear power facilities\u201d and $5 billion to \u201cprocure advanced nuclear power\u201d over the next ten years.\n\nFurthermore, there is currently a bill in the Senate\u2014[S.4897](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4897/text), the American Nuclear Infrastructure Act\u2014that aims to \u201cto reestablish United States global leadership in nuclear energy, revitalize domestic nuclear energy supply chain infrastructure, support the licensing of advanced nuclear technologies, and improve the regulation of nuclear energy.\u201d The bill has been [approved](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/12/committee-approves-nuclear-infrastructure-legislation-at-business-meeting) by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, but, so far, has not been passed or signed into law.\n\nA smaller, but still positive, signal for the uranium market is that Honeywell\u2019s Metropolis Works plant in Illinois\u2014the U.S.\u2019s sole uranium conversion facility\u2014will [restart](https://www.powermag.com/honeywell-to-reopen-sole-u-s-uranium-conversion-plant/) production of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) by early 2023, citing customer demand and the depletion of secondary supplies of UF6. The plant was idled in 2018 due to the weak market.\n\n## European Union\n\nIn the European Union, [countries are divided](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/29616/for-eastern-europe-nuclear-power-depends-on-eu-taxonomy) on nuclear energy, with Germany and Austria opposing it and France, Hungary, and eastern Europe supporting it. In March 2021, the Joint Research Center of the European Commission on nuclear energy released a [report](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/210329-jrc-report-nuclear-energy-assessment_en.pdf) to help the Commission determine whether nuclear energy should be included in the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities, which would help incentivize and scale up investment in the industry. (This report followed a previous assessment from the Technical Expert Group \\[TEG\\] that found \u201cnuclear energy has near to zero greenhouse gas emissions\u201d but that more research was needed due to a \u201clack of operational permanent experience of high-level waste disposal sites.\u201d) The JRC report concludes that there is no evidence that \u201cnuclear energy does more harm to human health or to the environment than other electricity production technologies already included in the Taxonomy.\u201d The report adds, \u201cThe nuclear energy-based electricity production and the associated activities in the whole nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. uranium mining, nuclear fuel fabrication, etc.) do not represent significant harm to any of the TEG \\[Technical Expert Group\\] objectives.\u201d While this is a positive sign for EU endorsement of nuclear energy, some uncertainty remains. This report is currently being [reviewed](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/e%20n/qanda_21_1805) by two sets of independent experts, the Group of Experts on radiation protection and waste management under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty and the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks on environmental impacts. The two Committees have three months to issue their assessment, and the two assessment reports, along with the JRC report, will inform the Commission's decision.\n\n## Non-utility Purchasing of Uranium\n\nOne final significant development in the uranium market is the purchasing and stockpiling of the metal by non-utility companies, particularly miners and physical asset management companies, signaling growing positive sentiment in the market. Mining companies may buy uranium for a variety of reasons, such as in order to meet purchase agreements or to build up collateral, but the recent moves also suggest renewed optimism that uranium prices may finally be ready to move up. In its Q1 2021 financial results, Cameco [noted](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets-us-west-2/quarterly/CCO-2021-Q1-MDA-FS-and-Notes.pdf) that, in total, \u201cThrough April this year junior uranium companies and financial funds had purchased approximately 10.5 million pounds U3O8.\u201d (Additionally, pp. 7-8 of that link provides a good overview of the most recent developments in the uranium market.) Some recent purchases by miners include:\n\n* In March, Australia\u2019s **Boss Resources** [agreed to purchase](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Uranium-companies-increase-inventory-from-spot-mar) 1.25 million pounds of U3O8\n* In March, **Uranium Royalty Corp.** (URC) [exercised](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Uranium-companies-increase-inventory-from-spot-mar) its option to buy 348,000 lbs from Yellow Cake. Notably, URC has the option to acquire anywhere from $2.5-$10 million worth of uranium per year from Yellow Cake for nine years, so the fact that they bought the maximum amount is an optimistic sign, and investors should watch for a similar purchase in Q1 2022.\n* In March, **Denison Mines** [purchased](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/denison-announces-successful-procurement-of-2-5-million-lbs-u3o8-as-part-of-project-finance-initiative-301260450.html) 2.5 million lbs.\n* In April, **Uranium Energy Corp.** [purchased](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uranium-energy-corp-expands-physical-uranium-initiative-to-purchase-2-1-million-pounds-u3o8-and-announces-financing-301262497.html) 2.1 million lbs. scheduled to be delivered at various points through 2023. Then, in May, they [announced](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334933/000118374021000106/ex991-20210520uec.htm) an additional 200,000 lb. purchase.\n* In April, **enCore Energy** [purchased](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/encore-energy-corp-announces-strategic-acquisition-of-physical-uranium-865933152.html) 200,000 lbs.\n* In May, **Cameco** [said](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Cameco-increases-uranium-purchases-to-meet-contrac) that it expects to purchase 11-13 million lbs. of uranium in 2021 to meet contracted demand, which is up from their previous estimate of 8-10 million lbs.\n\nTrusts and funds have also been buying up uranium, with London-listed Yellow Cake purchasing nearly 4 million pounds in March 2021 by exercising an option to buy from Kazatomprom, bringing its [total holdings](https://otp.investis.com/clients/uk/yellow_cake/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=2392&amp;newsid=1470152) to 12.96 million lbs. In April, Sprott Asset Management [announced](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/28/2218439/0/en/Sprott-Asset-Management-Enters-Into-Agreement-With-Uranium-Participation-Corporation-to-Form-the-Sprott-Physical-Uranium-Trust.html) that it would take over management of and restructure the Uranium Participation Corporation to form the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT) and list it on the NYSE\u2014UPC currently holds 16.27 million lbs. of U3O8 and 660,000 lbs. of UF6.\n\nOne of the main effects of these uranium holding companies purchasing the commodity is that they remove supply from the spot market, thus limiting the amount available for miners and utilities to buy and further pressuring utilities to enter into long-term contracts. There is also speculation that Sprott\u2019s upcoming purchases on the spot market will drive the uranium price up, making spot purchases less attractive for utilities. Sprott will likely utilize at-the-market raisings so that if its share price trades at a premium to NAV, it will issue new shares, raise funds, and purchase additional uranium. As one article [puts](https://articles.cruxinvestor.com/sprotts-physical-uranium-trust-to-change-the-uranium-game) it, \u201cATM \\[At-the-market\\] raisings are a well-worn path for Sprott, having raised around $4B this way into their bullion trusts over the past 15 months. This structure will enable SPUT to consistently nibble (if not gobble) at the bid in the spot market\u2014the perfect way to fray fuel buyer nerves and terrify producers that need to obtain spot uranium for their contracted deliveries.\u201d\n\nThe Sprott transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021 (the shareholder meeting is currently set for July 7) and seek a listing on the NYSE. Sprott already manages four other physical commodity trusts across gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, and the addition of uranium suggests strong investor interest in the commodity. Cameco [called](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/new-uranium-trust-could-be-game-changer-for-spot-market-cameco-says-64158423) the move by Sprott a \u201cgame changer\u201d for the spot market. (I\u2019ll add that the [Q1 2021 Cameco call](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets-us-west-2/quarterly/CCO-transcript-2021-Q1-call.pdf) had some interesting things to say about Sprott \\[on pp. 33 and 50\\] as well as the miner purchases \\[pp. 32-33, 39-40\\].)\n\n# Long-term Contracts\n\nAs noted above, the majority of uranium purchased by utilities comes from long-term contracts. Based on UxC data (found in a [Cameco report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1009001/000119312521035711/d121720dex3.htm)), the last significant contracting \u201ccycle\u201d was from 2005-2012 with large numbers of contracting volumes from 2005-2007, 2010, and 2012. Since then, long-term contracting has dropped significantly, particularly from 2019 to 2020, where the volume of long-term contracting went from 95.8 million lbs. to about 53 million lbs. At the same time, spot contracting increased to \\~80 million lbs. in 2020, the highest level in the past two decades (I apologize for the less-than-ideal quality of the chart; the fault is Cameco\u2019s or UxC\u2019s). In Cameco\u2019s view, lower contracting volumes in 2020 could be attributed in part to \u201cutilities focusing on operational safety amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d During 2020, there were also a number of U.S. policy uncertainties stemming from the Nuclear Fuel Working Group and the [Russian Suspension Agreement](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/100620-new-russian-uranium-suspension-agreement-takes-effect-says-commerce).\n\nOne way of thinking about where utilities are today in terms of contracting is to look at how much uranium utilities anticipate needing each year compared to how much they\u2019ve already contracted for delivery. As I mentioned above, when utilities sign long-term contracts the amount delivered can vary some amount to meet their needs, so there\u2019s a minimum and maximum range that might be delivered to utilities. The U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s (EIA) [2020 Uranium Marketing Annual Report](https://www.eia.gov/uranium/marketing/), which just came out in May, gives us a helpful chart (below) showing the maximum amount of uranium already under contract as well as the unfilled market requirements (i.e., what utilities need but haven\u2019t contracted for). Combined, these values give us the maximum anticipated market requirements of uranium for U.S. nuclear reactors. We see that even as overall demand remains relatively steady, the maximum contracted amount of uranium falls steeply throughout the decade. For the next one to two years, that shortfall might be able to be made up by purchasing on the spot market or drawing on existing utility inventories, but considering that long-term contracts typically begin uranium delivery two years after the contract is signed, utilities will likely need to sign new contracts soon.\n\nUltimately, no one knows when utilities will start to enter into long-term contracts again, but we know their inventories are shrinking, demand is growing, and future supply is becoming more uncertain as miners and investment funds purchase additional uranium from the spot market.\n\n# Market Performance\n\nHow has the uranium market responded to all of these events? Generally, equities have run ahead of the spot price to the point where, since December of last year, many miners have doubled or tripled in share price. Year to date (up to May 27), the Global X Uranium ETF (URA) is up 43% and the North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF (URNM) is up 50%. Other notable uranium stocks are also strong, including Denison Mines (DNN, +78%), Uranium Energy Corp (UEC, +73%), Cameco (CCJ, +46%), NexGen Energy (NXE, +62%), and Energy Fuels (UUUU, +50%) among others. The spot price, on the other hand, has remained around $30/lb.\n\nIf you look at any of the charts for these equities, you see a spike around December, marking when a [Bear Traps Report](https://www.thebeartrapsreport.com/) on uranium went out, and the URNM ETF saw record inflows. Looking at the charts, it can be tempting to think it\u2019s too late to get in. Even buying two or three months ago would put one in a good position leading up to catalysts in the second half of the year. But in a lot of ways the bull market is just getting started. The spot price is still currently sitting around $30/lb., and analysts like [Canaccord](https://app.box.com/s/y6evjvtwf7qmvlw02puz5utokmtcs52f) predict the price may reach $60/lb. by the end of 2025. For me, the run-up in equities and the upcoming catalysts, like the U.S. listing of the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, mean I can\u2019t be as patient as I\u2019d like when building my positions.\n\n# Upcoming Catalysts\n\nInvestors who believe a new uranium bull market is on the horizon or who are looking for additional evidence should keep the following catalysts in mind, in no particular order:\n\n* The **European Union** is set to decide, around June 2021, whether nuclear energy should be considered as part of its taxonomy of sustainable activities. Though Germany has notably turned away from nuclear energy, if the EU considers nuclear energy to be clean and safe, it would pave the way for more reactors in central and eastern Europe.\n* In the U.S., investors should **watch for the establishment of a uranium reserve** (for which $75 million has already been allocated for 2021) and the passage of the Nuclear Infrastructure Act.\n* **Watch for updates on mining production.** If miners continue to show production discipline, supply will be limited.\n* **Watch for updates on reactor license renewals.** If a reactor/plant receives a license renewal, that will represent an increase in uranium demand that likely did not appear in projections.\n* **Watch for continued uranium purchases from non-utility entities**, as this limits supply on the spot market and will encourage the signing of long-term contracts.\n* **Watch for the U.S. listing of the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust**, expected in the third quarter of 2021\u2014this is the most significant near-term catalyst, in my opinion.\n* **Watch for news on long-term contracts.** I suspect any new contracts would be announced during quarterly financial results, though earlier indicators may come in the form of a rising spot price or share price of a mining stock.\n\n# Risks and Uncertainty\n\nThough a number of market observers anticipate an increase in the price of uranium due to growing demand and tightening supply, some uncertainty and risk remains.\n\n* Uranium inventory and supply may be greater than estimated, which might delay the bull market by years.\n* Producer discipline may break down in the next few years, leading to additional uranium supply on the market and reducing the chances of a dramatic price increase.\n* In my research, I have yet to come across any articles or interviews from the perspective of utilities that examine why they are delaying signing long-term contracts and risking security of supply. Knowing this would provide a fuller picture of market dynamics.\n* Although the [World Nuclear Association](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide.aspx) estimates that roughly 50 nuclear reactors are being constructed today, it\u2019s not uncommon for these projects to be canceled or postponed, reducing the demand for uranium they would have required if they were up and running.\n* Black swan event: the possibility of another Fukushima-like nuclear disaster would significantly dampen demand for uranium and nuclear energy.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAfter a decade-long bear market spurred by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, positive sentiment of uranium and nuclear energy is once again improving. But low uranium prices over the past several years have led to underinvestment in the sector, leading to a lack of new mining projects to fill projected demand. As a result, utilities may face a supply crunch in the coming years and will eventually be pressured to enter into long-term contracts at higher uranium prices. Furthermore, recent physical uranium purchases from junior miners and investment funds\u2014a new development for the market\u2014signal growing investor interest in the metal and put additional pressure on a limited supply. Investors hoping to profit from a potential bull market should expect a volatile 2-4-year trade, especially if they choose to hold positions in individual miners and explorers, though they may also choose to mitigate that volatility by holding ETFs or physical asset companies.",

        "selftext": "**My Background:**\n\nYou might remember me from my posts on r/SPACs such as my [DD on SKLZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/k3ygol/feac_2021s_draftkings/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), my post [highlighting the use of margin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kbgtd6/why_this_is_a_onceinadecade_or_more_spac_bonanza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to take advantage of the asymmetric risk/reward profile in NAV SPACs, or my [extensive DD on SFTW/BlackSky](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/lpxih4/extensive_dd_on_blacksky_sftw_bsky/) that I managed to time almost exactly with the market top :(. I may also be resented by some on the sub for my obnoxious ranting against Canoo (HCAC/GOEV), which turned out to be accurate. \n\n**The Rumor**\n\nThe most recent [rumored target](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/traveloka-said-in-talks-to-list-via-richard-li-s-bridgetown-spac) for BTWN is Traveloka, the leading SEA online travel company.  Until we get a definitive agreement between the SPAC and target, we must glean company details from various interviews. \n\n**What Is Traveloka?**\n\nTraveloka is the #1 travel site in SEA. The app has 10M+ downloads on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.traveloka.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US) with almost 1 million reviews and an average rating of almost 5 stars (on the App Store as well). [SensorTower data](https://sensortower.com/ios/publisher/pt-traveloka-indonesia/898244860) shows more than 200,000 downloads in the last month alone. The [company claimed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-traveloka-funding/se-asias-biggest-travel-app-traveloka-raises-250-million-as-lockdowns-ease-idUSKCN24T0OG) more than 60 million downloads over all devices by July 2020. Although the company began as just a travel aggregator, it quickly expanded into offering its own products and service throughout Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, [and now Australia](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/329188). The company provides transportation, hotel, and experience bookings across SEA, a region that has historically been too complex for companies like Expedia (large investor in Traveloka, see below) to operate in effectively due to the fractured nature of the travel industry, multitude of languages, and local customs. \n\nTraveloka was disproportionately affected by COVID restrictions relative to other tech unicorns, seeing transaction reductions of **up to 95%** during the lockdown peak in April-May, 2020. They raised $250m in additional capital that summer to bolster the company balance sheet and expand into other sectors. But, this black swan event showed us the flexibility of the company and innovation of the leadership. They introduced live tour streaming and interactive social media auctions, as well as the Online Xperience platform where users can learn new skills and interact with other participants (noted an 8x increase in users in July, 2020). Case in point: transactions have reached 100% and 75% of pre-COVID levels in Vietnam and Thailand, respectively. They offered a huge promotion event in Indonesia called the Traveloka Epic Sale that generated a 1300% transaction increase with steep price discounts ([source for paragraph](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says)).\n\nOver the past few years, Traveloka has expanded beyond just offering travel services and into fintech. [They partnered](https://kr-asia.com/indonesias-traveloka-partners-with-state-lender-bni-for-paylater-service) with Indonesian state bank BRI in Oct 2019 to launch the PayLater VISA card and partnered with the BNI state bank in Jan 2020 to support a PayLater platform service. This is essentially building a new branch for the Traveloka brand, providing Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), credit card, and insurance (auto, travel, health) services. \n\nWhat\u2019s so special about yet another fintech operation? Traveloka is focusing not on the **un**banked, but on the **under**banked. To quote from [a great interview](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says) with the co-founder in Dec 2020: \u201cIn Indonesia, bank penetration is close to 50%, while credit card penetration is around 3%. Indonesians tend to have bank accounts, yet they do not have access to financing services. Here, we aim to bridge the gap by partnering with prominent banks and leveraging our robust technology and a large customer base.\u201d\n\nThey have also recently begun expanding fintech services outside their home country of Indonesia by [partnering with Thai bank SCB](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Finance/Indonesia-s-Traveloka-to-expand-fintech-business-into-Thailand), and are [in discussions](https://skift.com/2021/02/25/traveloka-targets-vietnam-thailand-for-launching-financial-services-ahead-of-possible-ipo/) with similar partners in Vietnam.\n\nI am especially interested in the BNPL offering, which is one of the fastest growing fintech sectors. For example, Afterpay (AFTPY) recently beat expectations with 167% YOY sales growth and Affirm (AFRM) had revenue growth of 81% and 64% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. To wit, Traveloka has already facilitated [more than 6 million loans](https://skift.com/2021/02/25/traveloka-targets-vietnam-thailand-for-launching-financial-services-ahead-of-possible-ipo/) in their home country of Indonesia after just two years of BNPL operation.\n\nWith the combination of their streaming tours, online experience options, and fintech operations, Traveloka not only managed to survive the COVID pandemic, they even managed to [turn profitable](https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/traveloka-profitable-2020-229947/) in 2020. What also helped was the company\u2019s ability to run at high efficiency. In the same article linked above, a company investor stated that Traveloka was able to burn only \u201clow single-digit million USD quarterly\u201d during the crisis.\n\nIf we use COVID revenue drop numbers [from Expedia](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/expedias-2020-revenue-sinks-57-pandemic-continues-roil-travel-industry/), we can assume a revenue reduction ranging from 40-60%. [Reportedly](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says), Traveloka issued \\~$100m in refunds in 2020. So, expected annual revenue for Traveloka in 2020 could have ranged from $166m-$250m, but still maintained profitability. Highly uncertain estimates, but it\u2019s the best I can do for now.\n\n**Company Founders and Funding:**\n\n* **Founded** in 2012 by Ferry Unardi (CEO), Derianto Kusuma (ex-CTO, left co.), and Albert Zhang.\n* **Ferry Unardi background**: B.S. Computer Science &amp; Engineering at Purdue, worked as software engineer at Microsoft for 3 years, 1 semester at Harvard Business School. Dropped out of MBA program when he realized how difficult and complex it was to book travel back to his hometown of Padang, Indonesia and decided to start Traveloka at [23 years old](https://www.prestigeonline.com/id/people-events/ferry-unardi-dropped-harvard-create-traveloka/).\n* **Derianto Kusuma background:** B.S. Computer Science at Stanford, software engineer at LinkedIn and Microsoft. Pivotal in engineering the tech architecture of the company. Resigned from Traveloka in 2018 [saying](https://medium.com/@derianto/departure-from-traveloka-and-starting-a-new-chapter-91676b712805), \u201cWith the full support of my co-founders and investors, after a long negotiation process finally we agreed in all aspects on my clean break from Traveloka, and the end of 2018 turns out to be the perfect time for this.\u201d\n* First funding round in 2012 (undisclosed) from East Ventures (Indo early stage inv fund)\n* Series A funding in 2013 (undisclosed) from: Global Founders Capital (VC arm of tech incubator Rocket Internet)\n* Series B (undisclosed) from: East Ventures, Hillhouse, Sequioa, JD.com. ([source](https://www.techinasia.com/traveloka-raises-350m-from-expedia), [source](https://www.prestigeonline.com/id/people-events/ferry-unardi-dropped-harvard-create-traveloka/)).\n* Series C round in 2017 ($500m) from: Expedia, East Ventures, Hillhouse, JD.com, and Sequioa Capital (officially hitting unicorn status). $350m of that alone was from Expedia. (see sources in previous point).\n* Additional round in 2019 ($420m) from GIC (Singapore state wealth fund), valuing Traveloka at \\~$3.3b. ([source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-07/traveloka-is-said-near-fundraising-at-sharply-lower-valuation), [source](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/traveloka/company_financials)).\n* Additional round in July 2020 ($250m): This was a rare unicorn *down-round*, with valuation reducing from $3.3b to $2.75b due to company hardship related to COVID. ([source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-07/traveloka-is-said-near-fundraising-at-sharply-lower-valuation), [source](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/traveloka/company_financials)).\n\n**My Thesis:** \n\nHow will the market react to Traveloka?  I expect **very** favorably because Traveloka is a combination of growth, value, and re-opening. **GROWTH** because the company is expanding rapidly across SEA and likely yields high percent revenue growth, **VALUE** because the company is profitable in a large and growing TAM, and **RE-OPENING** because travel was clobbered by COVID and everyone is scrambling to move around again. Traveloka is NOT one of the (seemingly endless) unknown companies taking advantage of market liquidity for the founders/investors to cash out or prop up some dev-stage tech shop. Traveloka has [long been recognized](https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/how-many-unicorns-are-there-in-southeast-asia%EF%BC%9F/) as one of the best unicorns in SEA, operational for almost a decade, and backed by some of the best known VC names.\n\nSEA is a very exciting market right now, but *especially* in terms of SPACs. There are approximately [500 unicorns](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Unicorns-surge-to-500-in-number-as-US-and-China-account-for-70) (private companies valued &gt; $1b) in the world as of Nov 2020. Almost half of those (242) are in the US, followed by China (119), India (24), UK (24), and South Korea (11). Just 5 are based in Indonesia, and SEA as a whole boasts [just 9 private unicorns](https://i0.wp.com/thelowdown.momentum.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87_20200529023712.png?resize=696%2C365&amp;ssl=1) (link is a bit out of date). Examples are Grab (AGC), GoTo (Gojek/Tokopedia merged privately), Lazada (struggling, overtaken in GMV by SE\u2019s Shopee), Traveloka ([that\u2019s us!](https://media2.giphy.com/media/KDVswimTNahWzcd7sV/giphy.gif)), Bukalapek, and Zilingo. The point of this is that the SPAC market is WAY oversaturated with many obscure companies going public at steep valuations despite meager revenue and growth. SEA, conversely, is extremely undersaturated.\n\nHere is the list of SEA SPAC mergers: \n\n* Grab is [merging](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Biggest+SPAC+Deal+Ever%3A+Grab+To+Go+Public+in+a+%2440+Billion+Merger+With+Altimeter+%28AGC%29%2C+Backed+by+Fidelity+and+BlackRock/18252682.html) with AGC.\n* Tiket (smaller competitor to Traveloka) is [rumored](https://investor.id/market-and-corporate/cova-acquisition-negosiasi-dengan-unicorn-di-indonesia) to be in talks with COVA.\n* Tokopedia was [originally rumored](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/thiel-backed-spac-said-to-weigh-up-to-10-billion-tokopedia-deal) to be merging with BTWN, but has since [merged privately](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/) with Gojek and is now [weighing public listing options](https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-tokopedias-merged-entity-goto-plans-preipo-fundraise). *Could* still go with BTWN, but I think direct listing is possible now.\n* MNC Play is [merging](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001807594/000121390021016795/ea138123ex99-1_malacca.htm) with MLAC (btw, quick shill: MLAC is way, way overlooked - I hold a bunch of warrants).\n\nThat\u2019s it. Despite the region having 360 million internet users (see below), there are few unicorn targets and SPACs relative to the United States. SEA is ripe for the SPACening. Here are some highlights regarding the region, taken from the [BTWN S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001815086/000121390020044067/fs12020_bridgetown.htm%5d:):\n\n* \u201cWhile we may pursue an acquisition or a business combination target in any business or industry, we focus our search on a target with operations or prospective operations in the technology, financial services, or media sectors, which we refer to as the \u201cnew economy sectors\u201d, in Southeast Asia.\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] is fast becoming a major regional economic force and a driver of global growth.\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] remains one of the fastest growing regions in the world with economic growth averaging 5.4% per annum\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] is estimated to become the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2030 after the US, China, and the EU.\u201d\n* \u201cCollective findings by Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company indicate that the region\u2019s internet economy has crossed the $100 billion mark in 2019 and is poised to triple to an estimated $300 billion by 2025.\u201d\n* \u201cWith approximately 360 million Internet users in the region, 90% of which connect to the Internet primarily through their mobile phones, Southeast Asia boasts one of the most engaged mobile internet audience in the world.\u201d\n\nIn a word:  **BULLISH**.\n\n**The SPAC: Bridgetown I (BTWN)**\n\nFounded as a co-venture between Thiel Capital (Peter Thiel) and Pacific Century (Richard Li), focused on tech, fintech, or media in Southeast Asia (SEA). [The sponsor team](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001815086/000121390020044067/fs12020_bridgetown.htm%5d:):\n\n* The primary name in BTWN is **Peter Thiel**, one of the most renowned tech investors of the 21st century. Peter Thiels first big win was cofounding Paypal with Elon Musk, then later being the first outside investor in Facebook by providing $500k in return for a 10% stake in the company in 2004. He sold most of his shares between 2012-2017 for  \\~$1.1 billion, representing a return of 220,000%. Side note: if he had never sold any of his \\~37.76m shares, his equity in FB today would be \\~$12.4b, an eye-popping return of 2,480,000%... if he had held. Other *other* side note, these are rookie numbers in comparison to Jeff Bezos and his family. Their initial investment of \\~$300k into AMZN back in 1994-1995 (later supplemented by a few dozen angel investors), would provide a return of \\~55,500,000% over 27 years. But, I digress. Other early investments by Peter Thiel (just listing off his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel)): ABNB, LinkedIn, Yelp, SPOT, SpaceX, PLTR, ASAN, and Stripe, among others. To put it mildly: The guy\u2019s a legend.\n* Another primary name here is **Richard Li**, billionaire founder of Pacific Century, founder of Star TV (Asia\u2019s first satellite-delivered cable-TV, later sold to Murdoch\u2019s News Corp). Li\u2019s Pacific Century invests heavily in media and telecom, including companies such as Viu (video streaming), HKT (telecom), and Legendary Pictures. Other investments range from Tensar (soil solutions) to Sodecia North America (engineered materials) to FWD (insurance). One of Li\u2019s most notable investments is being among the earliest investors in the Chinese conglomerate Tencent (now $600b market cap). Various other names include Sohu (media/gaming), Chegg (ed-tech), and Tokopedia (e-commerce). \n* CEO/CFO/Director: **Daniel Wong**, senior VP of Pacific Century Group. Representing PCG and Richard Li.\n* Chairman of the board: **Matt Danzeisen**, Head of Private Investments at Thiel Capital. Representing Thiel Capital and Peter Thiel.\n* Member of the board: **Samuel Altman**, the CEO of OpenAI and former President of Y Combinator. Altman has invested in many behemoth tech companies, including AirBnb, Stripe, Reddit, Asana, and Pinterest. He [joined the board of Expedia](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/sam-altman-joins-expedia-group-board-bringing-expertise-openai-ceo-former-y-combinator-president/), one of the primary investors in Traveloka, in 2019.\n* Other board members: **John R. \u201cJay\u201d Hass**, **Joon Hwang**.\n* Senior advisor: **Kenneth Ng**.\n\n**What Is the Investment Move?**\n\nThere are three choices for investing in this SPAC: (1) BTWN shares, (2) BTWN warrants (BTWNW), or (3) BTWN options.\n\nOf the three, I think that warrants are the least desirable choice. As of this writing, they are trading at $1.95, which is a somewhat steep premium to pay in the current SPAC market environment.\n\nThe second-best option is BTWN shares - they are trading just 10 cents over NAV at $10.10, so they offer good downside protection at the cost of more limited upside. I have a sizable position in BTWN shares.\n\nThe best choice, in my opinion, is BTWN call options. Each options contract gives you leverage over 100 shares. Because the implied volatility (IV) on SPACs is so low right now, premiums are cheap. With BTWN July $10c trading at $0.30 ($30/contract), the break-even price on each contract is just 1.98% above the current share price. This means that you are getting leverage of 33:1 (depending on the contract price). As with all options trades, liquidity is incredibly important. In the case of the July calls, open interest (the number of active contracts) is **26,281** as of this writing.\n\nIn my opinion, these **July options offer one of the greatest reward/risk ratios in the market right now**. For every $1 move up in share price above $10, each contract gains an intrinsic value of $100. That means the percent return at expiration on each contract is:\n\n* 100% at price of $10.60\n* 233% at price of $11.00\n* 567% at price of $12.00\n* 900% at price of $13.00\n* 1233% at price of $14.00\n\nSo to provide an example from [optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/), purchasing 50 July $10c options contracts for $30 each ($0.30/share) at a total of $1,500 could generate the following $ returns: [http://opcalc.com/vql](http://opcalc.com/vql). Pretty astounding!\n\nNot to mention that option contract prices are also dictated by volatility. If the underlying stock were to become more volatile, options contract premiums will (up to a certain share price, that is, bc we\u2019re buying ITM options).\n\n**Why Are Options Premiums So Low?**\n\nWell, because pops on SPAC DA announcements are, to say the least, muted right now. The growth market has gotten hammered since March, with many stocks down 30-60% from ATHs. SPACs were disproportionately affected because they are among the most speculative investment in the growth market and investors have been reluctant to jump back in. At its low, the SPAK ETF was down **37% from ATH**. But over the last couple weeks, the market has begun to rebound. For example, 5 days ago SPAK [broke out](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SPAK/28503eb61b8) of its month\u2019s long downtrend with the RSI surpassing 50. Many pre-merger and deSPAC names have begun to trend upward with 5d and 7d EMAs crossing over the 20d EMA, including [SKLZ](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SKLZ/28503ebgcma) (my baby), [BFLY](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/BFLY/28503ebhyy6), [SOFI](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SOFI/28503ebjbl5), and [ACTC](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/ACTC/28503ebl7td).\n\nThe low premiums on these options are why I think this is a great play right now. As Warren Buffet said, \u201cBe greedy when others are fearful\u201d (though I\u2019m **sure** he wasn\u2019t referring to options). My position in shares is just a cash reserve right now with potential upside (I discussed that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kbgtd6/why_this_is_a_onceinadecade_or_more_spac_bonanza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) a bit), but the options appear to have incredibly high upside by providing leverage. With my 200 ITM options, I am gaining leverage over 20,000 shares, equivalent to a $200,000 position, for a price of just $6,000 (albeit with a strict time constraint).\n\n**Why This SPAC?**\n\nThere are [hundreds of active SPACs](https://spactrack.net/activespacs/) right now actively searching or rumored to be in talks with a target. Buying contracts on any of the optionable ones that don\u2019t have credible rumors is a big risk. Case in point: I did just that with XPOA options as a cheap gamble and am now down 40% on them because they\u2019re merging with a relatively boring mobile gaming company. *Note: I think the company is good, but not exactly exciting for the rest of the market, unfortunately*.\n\nBTWN is a unique case, however. The management team is composed of some of the best investors in the world (Thiel, Li) and they have a credible rumor (Bloomberg) targeting a long-established unicorn (Traveloka) in one of the hottest marketplaces in the world (SEA). As a comparison, the SPAC AGC (planning to merge with SEA\u2019s Grab) is trading at 19% over NAV. **At that price, the intrinsic value of BTWN July calls would represent a return of 533%** (assuming a purchase price of $30/contract). The AGC merger values Grab at around $40b, approximately 8-9x that of the rumored BTWN/Traveloka merger. Because the valuation of Traveloka is so much smaller, it can have much higher volatility during price discovery.\n\nYou could always try the October calls, but the premium is 100% higher and open interest is just 28% of the July calls. If we haven\u2019t gotten a DA announcement in the next couple weeks, you could just roll the contracts to the October strike for a minimal loss.\n\nSide note: I recently DMed the author of the Bloomberg article, Yoolim Lee, on Twitter to check in on the rumor itself. She confirmed that (1) no, there haven\u2019t been recent rumor updates, and (1) yes, the rumor is for BTWN, not BTNB.\n\n**How To Size Your Options Position**\n\n**DO NOT YOLO** these options. In fact, never YOLO on anything, let alone options (well, SPAC shares are safe pre-merger). We invest in SPACs because of the floor price built into pre-merger commons. Options on these shares are inherently high risk, but in the current market environment this is even more so the case. My call options represent just a small percentage of my portfolio because they can absolutely go to zero if the share price is under $10 by July 16 or can easily lose 50% of their value. The person or MM writing/selling these options is, in fact, betting on that scenario. Personally, **I keep options purchases at or under 1% of my portfolio**. Let me reiterate: DO. NOT. YOLO. If you get the urge to, just buy a small percentage in options, then put the rest into BTWN shares since they are protected by the NAV.\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I\u2019m just a random guy on the internet. Assume the worst about me and do your own research!\n\n**My Positions:**\n\n* 9,000 BTWN shares - subject to change, probably moving into PACX because it is *wayyyy* overlooked and undervalued.\n* 200 July 16 $10c options",

        "selftext": "What follows got downvoted in the daily, and for the life of me, I can't understand why.  Either you can't read more than 3 words in a row without a rocket emoji, think the entire stock market exists on 3 tickers, or you hate money.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\ntl;dr:  Buy $FNMA shares and hold for the month.  There are no options on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, so stop asking for strikes and expiry.  Why?  The Supreme Court may issue an opinion this month that releases Fannie and Freddie from the FHFA's conservatorship.  Were this to happen, Fannie and Freddie would no longer need pay their entire profit margin to the government, and the Feds might actually have to pay back to the companies the entire excess above the bailout received:  $110 BILLION. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nIn 2017, Fannie Mae (Fannie) and Freddie Mac (Freddie) shareholders sued then Sec. of Treasury Mnuchin, (now called Collins v. Yellen, after the administration change), that is now waiting on an opinion from the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS or the Court).\n\nThe Shareholders argue that Fannie and Freddie were unlawfully placed into a conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), because FHFA's creation violates the separation of powers.\n\nThe questions present to the Court SCOTUS are:\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060Whether FHFA\u2019s structure violates the separation of powers; and\n\n2.\t\u2060\u2060Whether courts must set aside a final agency action when the agency was unconstitutionally structured and strike down the statutory provisions that make FHFA independent.\n\n\"Ginger, what the fuck does that mean?\"\n\nWell, for all you non lawyers, those with a fifth grade education from the good ole US of A should know that separation of powers means the legislative, executive, and judicial branches must act independently of one another.  If they do not, and, for example, the executive branch creates a government agency to oversee the mortgage collateralization without a direct authorization from Congress, the agency is unconstitutional and all its actions are therefore invalid.\n\nSuch are the arguments made in the Petitioners' case:  if FHFA was structured unconstitutionally, therefore, all of FHFA's actions, including the action to place Fannie and Freddie into a conservatorship, were unconstitutional.\n\n\"Ginger, so what?  I still don't see rocket ship emojis, and Fannie Mae doesn't rhyme with Gamestop, AMC or Blackberry.\"\n\nWell, my smooth brained degenerate, as part of its actions, the FHFA created a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement whereby Fannie and Freddie must pay, to the government their entire net worth on a quarterly basis, minus a small capital buffer.\n\n\"Ginger, I still don't get it.\"\n\nWow.  You really are an orangutan.  Back when most of you were hiding your boners with a textbook when changing classes, a little thing called the Great Recession happened. At an extremely high level, that even an ape can understand:  Banks did bad things.  These bad things were bought by Fannie and Freddie.  The bad things Fannie and Freddie bought almost wiped them out if not for a government bailout.  As part of bailout, the government now receives a \"dividend\" equal to all of the Companies profit on a quarterly basis.  This is called the Net Worth Sweep.\n\n\"Ginger, is that a big deal?\"\n\nDuh.  Fannie has $3.5 Trillion in assets on its books.  The next closes company, is JP Morgan at 2 Trillion.  Fannie alone has 75% more assets than the next closest company.  If you're thinking \"Holy fuck\", you're right.\n\n\"Ginger, but wait does this mean the Court is going to give Fannie and Freddie back the money and stop holding its balance sheet hostage?\"\n\nI don't know, but I sure fucking hope so!  SCOTUS is grappling with a situation where FHFA is unconstitutional and what will happen with all the money the conservatorship collected over the last 12 years. (SCOTUS won't decide what to do with the money - it will decide the questions of federal and constitutional law, and kick the decision back to the Circuit and District Courts to issue the order consistent with its opinion.)\n\n\"Ginger, what kind of profit could we be looking at?\"\n\nFannie is trading at $2.3 per share right now.  Fannie does $25 Billion in revenues a year.  At a conservative 4x multiple, Fannie is a $100B company.  At a 20x multiple, $500B.\n\n\"Ginger, why do I have to buy now?\"\n\nThe Court releases opinions usually on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and on the third Monday of each sitting. The Court goes into summer recess at the end of the month and its next term doesn't start until Sept. - Oct. Collins was argued back in December, and its possible an opinion will be issued before the end of the current term.  If you wanna gamble, it won't cost you much.\n\nta-ta for now",

Those include multi-factor authentication, endpoint detection and response, encryption and hiring a skilled security team. \ud83d\ude80\n\nThe White House is warning businesses to take critical security measures to protect against ransomware, as hackers change their tactics from stealing data to disrupting critical infrastructure. \ud83d\ude80\n\nThe open letter followed came after a string of ransomware attacks that stopped fuel from flowing up the East Coast and closed off beef and pork production from one of the U.S.A's leading food suppliers. There was 65,000 successful ransomware attacks last year, according to statistics. \ud83d\ude80\n\n\u201cMuch as our homes have locks and alarm systems and our office buildings have guards and security to meet the threat of theft, we urge you to take ransomware seriously and ensure your corporate cybersecurity match the threat,\u201d Ms. Neuberger wrote. \ud83d\ude80\n\nBlackBerry Guard is a product that offers all of the above mentioned available for implementation.

The short interest on the float currently stands above 50%. The stock is currently trading at $6/share, but I calculate the fair value to be $15-20. \n\nWhy so much short interests?? \n\nBasically, there have been a lot of disinfo in the mainstream media on the US private prisons and politicians have used them as scapegoats for the failures in the system. The share price of Geo Group has plunged more than 80% since 2017 while its earning has been holding up well during this period. The company has over 60% of its revenue generated from its US business - despite the recent attacks from Biden's execute order, Geo only sees around 10% loss in revenue in 2021 although future is uncertain. However, the company can survive financially even if all of its US business is wiped out - but that won't happen and things can take a dramatic turn comes next presidential election. Most people who short the company simply haven't done their homework.\n\nDo we know Geo are the good guys??\n\nYes. Geo don't run prisons, they run rehabilitation centers and truly give \"inmates\" a second chance in life - we need more of this, not destroying it! Just watch the documentary by our beautiful Candice Owen, it's eye opening. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe5u20JO2sk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe5u20JO2sk)\n\nHappy Prison Break!",

Thanks in advance for reading. Most importantly, please feel free to step in and correct any mistakes you notice or criticize where you find appropriate. \n\n**I'm posting this because I have a lot of money (to me) in this and would love for people to poke holes in this company and potentially save me from losing that money :) We are all trying to help each other here.**\n\n#### Post structure\n* It's long and most people want a TL;DR.  Each section will have its own TL;DR and you can skim through all of them to get the picture, or just jump directly to the summary the very end.\n* I strongly encourage you to at least skim the Katapult [investor presentation](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf) before reading. But it will be referenced a lot regardless.\n* This is divided up into different sections with a table of contents below. Everyone has different factors they care about in companies so I encourage you to check out what matters to you.\n* This post will certainly not be perfect nor exhaustive.\n\n#### References\n* Mostly spread out throughout the post. I did list some general sources at the end, but couldn\u2019t fit them in so they\u2019ll be in a comment on the full post and linked to in the table of contents. \n* I will not be providing resources for easily google-able facts that are not relevant to the primary points. As an example, no source is provided for the fact that Tiger Global Management was founded in 2001 by Chase Coleman III. Just google it bro.\n* I do get lazy so I probably skipped a few that I should have had, just drop a comment and I will find the source for you. \n\n#### Table of Contents\n1.

Background Information on the PIPE, SPAC Team, and Target\n|**TL;DR**|\n|:---:|\n|PIPE|\n|The world renowned Tiger Global Management who were early investors in Facebook, Spotify,  Stripe, Coinbase, Xiaomi. Certainly the most famous of anyone / thing else on this list.|\n|SPAC|\n|Founded Nov 2019, before the flood of SPACs. Extremely qualified, educated group with many decades in Fintech  / on Wall Street. As an example, the CEO remarks about how well he knows /has worked often with JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.

I think those were the things. I\u2019m not speaking for them, but I think they saw in us some of the feedback I get from many of the investors, we were thrilled to have Tiger join us. You know, I had had a call with Chase [Chase Coleman III - Tiger Global Management founder] last minute. Somebody said, Chase wants to talk to you. And it was like, okay. So he was great. He was fantastic. I really enjoyed our conversation. And it\u2019s after that that they made their commitment. So we\u2019re excited to have them as a partner.\n\n#### Neuburger Berman\n* Investment management firm. $339 billion AUM. Bought by Lehman in 2002 after 60 years in operation and spun off after they collapsed in 2008.\n\n\n### 1.2 Sponsor:  FinServ Acquisition Corporation (FSRV)\n\n#### FSRV\n* $250 million SPAC that IPO\u2019d in Nov. 2019\n* DA with Katapult in December 2020\n* Merger vote  Monday, June 7th, 2021\n\n#### CEO Lee Einbinder\n* On Wall Street since 1982 after graduating from Princeton, briefly left to go to Wharton Business School [(source)](https://www.audible.com/pd/Demystifying-SPACs-FinServ-Acquisition-Corp-CEO-Former-Barclays-Vice-Chair-Lee-Einbinder-Podcast/B094J2XSBL). \n* Solomon Brothers early 1990s.

To me on the outside, it reads like a few Cornell undergrads had a decent idea, got the ear of an angel investor,  and then got actual experts to design the real product.\n\nMost importantly are the two following experts in computer science / machine learning who were founders:\n\t* **Ashutosh Saxena,** PhD from Stanford in Computer Science with an emphasis on artificial intelligence ]https://www.linkedin.com/in/saxenaashutosh]\n\t* **Pierre Sermanet,** PhD in deep learning and computer vision from New York University, researcher for Google Brain [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sermanet]\nOther co-founders:\n\t* Andrew Hancox: Angel investor, invested in BlockFi\n\t* Brandon Wright, Chinedu Eleanya, Cornell undergrads at time of founding. \n\t\n\n#### Current Executive Team\n**CEO Orlando Zayas**:\n* CEO since 2017\n*  Former VP of Emerging Markets at GE Capital\n\n#### Headquarters\nIn 2021 relocated from New York, NY to Plano, TX to be in a business-friendly jurisdiction. [[News Flash \u2022 Plano Economic Development, TX \u2022 CivicEngage](http://www.planotexas.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=93)]\n\n#### Number Of Employees\nI can\u2019t find this information easily.  Going purely by LinkedIn numbers, there are 101 employees. LinkedIn \u201cCompany Size\u201d info says 51-200 employees. The careers page has 21 open positions [ [BambooHR](https://teamkatapult.bamboohr.com/jobs/) What I can say is that if you look back at a WebArchive page of the listings from January [BambooHR](http://web.archive.org/web/20210118070621/https://teamkatapult.bamboohr.com/jobs/) you can see there were only 13 and they were also a different set of positions. \n\n_____\n\n# 2 The Deal\n|**TL;DR**|\n|:---:|\n|SPAC trust+150m PIPE = 400m. Only 8% will go to the balance sheet, with the other 92% going as cash to existing shareholders and tx fees. But, while on the higher end of the spectrum, this is pretty common. If you want to own a solid company you have to pay up. |\n\n&gt; You know, I had had a call with Chase [Chase Coleman III - Tiger Global Management founder] last minute. Somebody said, Chase wants to talk to you. And it was like, okay. So he was great. He was fantastic. I really enjoyed our conversation. And it\u2019s after that that they made their commitment. So we\u2019re excited to have them as a partner.\n\\-Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas\n\n$250M from the SPAC trust and $150M from the PIPE will go to Katapult ([slide 45](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf))\n\nOf this 400m, here\u2019s where it ends up:\n* $325m will be provided as cash consideration to existing shareholders. \n* $32m will go to the balance sheet\n* $43m will be spent on transaction expenses\n\n26% of the combined company will be owned by the SPAC holders. \n\n*Note: In reality, it\u2019s 18m coming from he balance sheet for the deal, and 50m going to it, but I just simplified that to a 32m credit to the balance sheet here.* \n\n### Pros\nThe pro is that we get Katapult in the public markets.  We\u2019re not getting a horrible 5% or 10% cut like some SPAC deals, 26% is decent. \n### Cons\nThe real con is obvious: Of the $400m in financing, $325m of it is going directly to buy out the current shareholders. Only 32/400 = 8% is going to the balance sheet to help the company! 82% of the proceeds will be going to buy out existing shareholders. \n\nAdditionally, PIPE is getting 16% of the final company but only putting in \n \n### My take\nWhile the exact % going to shareholders may be on the high end at 82% (but not highest end), this is the price of buying a good, profitable company with realistic growth prospects. Here are some other examples of this.\n|Company/SPAC|% proceeds to existing shareholders|\n:--|:--|\n|**MUDS/Topps**|91.2% [source](https://www.mudrickcapitalacquisitioncorp.com/static-files/d04b0221-2195-4b87-b305-63b55bde4e61)|\n|**Hostess**|77.3% minus Hostess\u2019 side of tx costs [source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1644406/000119312516641691/d191744dex992.htm) |\n|**Utz**|12.2%  [source](https://s25.q4cdn.com/130011723/files/doc_presentations/0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5.pdf)|\n|**BurgerFi**|38.2% [source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1723580/000121390020026080/ea126713ex99-2_opesacquis.htm)|\n|**FGNA/OppFi**|100% [source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818502/000110465921017063/tm216066d1_ex99-2.htm)|\n|**DraftKings**|25% [source](http://eagleinvestmentpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DK-Investor-Presentation-23-Dec-2019_vF.pdf)|\n\n____\n\n\n# 3 Katapult \n|**TL;DR**|\n|:---:|\n|Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services for non-prime customers provided at checkout time for durable goods (appliances, car parts, computers, etc). They are able to make a niche here and profit due to building sophisticated models of non-prime customer behavior beyond what a traditional credit score gives. They find the ones that they can lend to, and provide a fast checkout experience to get your items, and a convenient payment mechanism that incentivizes paying the item off. |\n\n&gt; And so I think they saw that we were clearly focused in an area that is being overlooked. It\u2019s a green space and then we got to profitability. And so, you know, we\u2019re driving, you know, and that\u2019s not much, that\u2019s not a lot of the other BNPLs can\u2019t brag about that. And I can, but it\u2019s been because our business is built on true fundamentals and we understand the future and we understand what\u2019s going to happen. And so we\u2019ve planned the business out well. \n\\- Orlando Zayas\n\n### 3.1 Business\nKatapult\u2019s business is to provide \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d service to non-prime customers at checkout time.  They work with merchants to integrate their system into online payment portals, and at checkout customers will have the option to check out. If customers pay off the lease within 90 days, they pay only 5% plus a $45 fee. \n\nThey also parter with prime lender Affirm. The duo provides a \u201cwaterfall\u201d service to merchants. They claim Affirm rejects 65% of applicants at many of the merchants Affirm is with, these are passed on to Katapult and Katapult specializes in these nonprime customers and approves 60% of them [(source)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf).\n\n### 3.2 Technology\nThey use a variety of inputs collected throughout the shopping experience, as well as user inputs, to build a sophisticated model of the risk provided by the customer. In a recent podcast, FinServ CEO Lee Einbinder actually potentially let slip one of their inputs that might be used to judge risk-  the way users move their mouse.  They claim to use [(slide 30)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf):\n* \u201c7 minimum user inputs\u201d\n* ~ \u201c100 gathered user attributes\u201d\n* ~ \u201c2,000 3rd party data elements\u201d\n\nIn most scenarios they claim to provide ~30% better detection of \u201ctrue good payers\u201d than an existing 3rd party off the self score. [(slide 31)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)\n\n### 3.3 Quick facts\nProfitable since 2020 [(slide 37)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)\nAverage order value is $600[(slide 25)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)\nAverage return on lease has increased 40% , relative to it\u2019s value at the end of 2018[(slide 32)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)\nAverage time to lease payoff is around 7 months [(page 3)](And so I think that\u2019s going to continue. We\u2019ve done projections, you know, over a billion, you know, up to obviously two billion. And we really don\u2019t need, you know, additional capital.)\n\n\n### 3.4 Balance Sheet\nEasily one of the healthier balance sheets we\u2019ve seen in SPAC-land. The [highlights](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm): \n* After the merger they will have 32m of net debt. \n* Liquidity situation: &gt;$100m of liquidity \n* They do not foresee a need ed to take on any more debt or raise capital to achieve their targets. From the CEO [(page 3):](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)\n&gt; \u2026..we have a lending agreement where it\u2019s a warehouse agreement that literally can expand up to 250 million, [\u2026] even though we did, you know, around 200 million and last year, I only used about a third of that line to fund that growth. \n&gt; \n&gt; And so I think that\u2019s going to continue. We\u2019ve done projections, you know, over a billion, you know, up to obviously two billion. And we really don\u2019t need, you know, additional capital.\n\n### 3.5 Financials and Growth\nRevenue in 2020 was 247m. Revenue Growth for 2018-2020 has been at about 140% YoY [(slide 12)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm) on average. Going forward, they\u2019re expecting  upwards of 75% for the next few years before beginning to taper off to \u2018only\u2019 in the 40%s YoY [(slide 37)](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf) This equates to about $1,130 in expected revenue in 2022 (not 2026  or something insane!),.\n\nEBITDA / Profit  for 2020 was 41m EBITDA and 23m net profit . For 2021, they expect EBITDA growth of 114% to 70m before, like the revenue, tapering to \u201conly\u201d 43% EBITDA growth in 2022 for 216m revenue. \n\nThe CEO is clear that they are focused on what is working and not getting sidetracked, at least for the near term [(page 4)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)\n&gt; **Speaker 2:** \u2026.There\u2019s enough headroom for us to grow just in buy now, pay later, and then maybe we\u2019ll introduce a checking account or something like that a little bit later, or where would you say you\u2019re seeing your growth? Is it BNPL or is it more let\u2019s go into other things?\n&gt; **Orlando Zayas (CEO):**  You know, near term, and that\u2019s in the next two to three years, I would say definitely staying in the BNPL space. You know, as we grow our portfolio of consumers and you\u2019re right now, we\u2019ve approved over 1.5 million consumers for shopping, you know, we\u2019ve done over 500,000 leases. And so as we grow that base, I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of opportunity to, you know, do things like checking accounts and other things, because, you know, we\u2019re going to have a much different perspective about that consumer. It\u2019s not going to be FICO driven. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n___\n\n\n# 4. The Competition and Their Valuations\n|**TL;DR**|\n|:---:|\n|There is a lot of competition in BNPL - Katapult sidesteps all of this by only going for the customers that the other players reject. They have figured out how to profit off of this group and are doing extremely well. Their public peers in BNPL - even the ones that sort of look at that non-prime space - are trading at levels 5-10 times higher than Katapult on a revenue/earnings adjusted basis. The value is insanely cheap compared to the other players. |\n\n### 4.1 There is a lot of competition in the Buy Now Pay Later space. There is (almost) no competition in the non-prime Buy Now Pay Later space.\nBuy now pay later companies are growing like weeds. Here is a short list of public ones:\n* Affirm\n* PayPal\n* Afterpay\n* Sezzle\nAnd private ones:\n* Klarna (The king in the space)\n* QuadPay\n* SplitIt\nthe list goes on and on\u2026by the time you read this there are probably two more.\n\nBut these are almost all going for **prime customers**. They use traditional factors like your credit score, along with more modern ones, to accept or decline a customer. In Katapult\u2019s investor presentation, they state that Affirm declines **up to 65% of the people who apply**.  Even if this number is traditionally lower - it\u2019s an insane group. FSRV CEO Einbinder says he thinks the number is something like **40-45% r**ejected in the podcast in the References section. It\u2019s a huge number - and Katapult has the field all to itself, as long as it can find out how to profit off of them when others passed on the opportunity. And without a doubt, the answer to that question is that they have. \n\n### 4.2 Katapult\u2019s Post-Merger Valuation Will Be Shockingly Low Compared to Public and Private Peers\nComparing the companies as a function of their valuation divided by their market cap shows a clear trend\u2026except for Katapult?\n\n|Company |Market Cap|2020 Rev|M Cap / 2020 Rev|2020 EBITDA|M Cap / 2020 EBITDA|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**Affirm^1**|15.8b|510m|40x|-112m|N/A - Negative EBITDA|\n|**Afterpay**|21.3b|519.2m|41x|44.4m|479.9x|\n|**Sezzle**|1.36b|58.8m|23x|-27.9m|N/A - Negative EBITDA|\n|**Klarna^2**|31b|1.087b|28.5x|-195m|N/A - Negative EBITDA|\n|**Katapult**|1.33b|247m|5.4x|41m|32.4x|\nSources: [Affirm](https://investors.affirm.com/static-files/9de99ee8-3e89-46db-80c2-1af22a07543b) , [Afterpay](https://afterpay-corporate.yourcreative.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-FINAL-APT_FY20-Annual-Report.pdf) , [Sezzle](https://asx.api.markitdigital.com/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02347237-2A1283548?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4) , [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/assets/2021/03/30041759/Annual-Report-Klarna-Bank-AB-2020-210329.pdf) , [Katapult](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021022357/ea139732ex99-1_finserv.htm)\n\nThe situation gets remains when you look at the projected 2021 numbers (Not 2026 or something, 2021, which is over in 6 months\u2026) .\n\n|Company |Market Cap|2021 Rev|M Cap / 2021 Rev|2021 EBITDA|M Cap / 2021 EBITDA|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**Affirm^1**|15.8b|770m|20.5x|-125m|N/A - Negative EBITDA|\n|**Afterpay^(1,3)**|21.3b|-|25.7x|-|-|\n|**Sezzle^3**|1.36b|-|12.73x|-|-|\n|**Klarna^2**|31b|-|-|-|-|\n|**Katapult**|1.33b|455m|2.92x|S|19x|\n\n\n^1 Affirm and Afterpays\u2019 fiscal years end in June . So this revenue data is technically shifted back in time by 6 months, but their Market Cap is current. The effect is that this is a little unfair to these companies - their M Cap / Rev #s should a bit lower. But you get the order of magnitude here. I thought about calculating it on a Jan-Dec basis but gave up when I couldn't find 2022E (For July-Dec 2021) numbers easily.\n\n^2 Klarna is a private company. [Market cap /valuation estimate.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/invest-now-sell-later/) I can\u2019t find 2021 estimates. \n\n^3 I can\u2019t find 2021 expected numbers for these guys. And I do not feel like digging more. These numbers are instead calculated from the Katapult investor presentation - a footnote states the multiples provided were as of market close on 12/15 - I have scaled the multiples by the stock price change since then.  [slide 42.](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf). EBITDA multiples were not provided in a way that allows this. \n\nI won\u2019t even add 2022\u2026..\u2026..but you get the point. It\u2019s being priced at an insane discount. Surely it must be growing more slowly? Let\u2019s take a look at the 2020 revenue growth numbers. Again, please keep in mind the caveat that Afterpay / Affirm are based on June 2019- June 2020 #s, while the others are Jan 2020-Dec 2020. So give those guys whatever discount you think is fair or do the math I was too lazy to do :)\n\n|Company|2020 Revenue Growth %|\n:--|:--|\n|**Affirm**|92%|\n|**Afterpay**|97%|\n|**Sezzle**|272%|\n|**Klarna**|40%|\n|**Katapult**|168%|\n\nSources: [Affirm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm#tSCFA1) , [Afterpay](https://afterpay-corporate.yourcreative.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-FINAL-APT_FY20-Annual-Report.pdf) , [Sezzle](https://asx.api.markitdigital.com/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02347237-2A1283548?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4) , [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/assets/2021/03/30041759/Annual-Report-Klarna-Bank-AB-2020-210329.pdf) , [Katapult](https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/Test%20Folder-af/KPLTinvestordeckdec20.pdf)\n\nThe Katapult CEO was directly asked about this valuation gap. His response says it all [(page 6):](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)\n\n&gt; I think it\u2019s an undiscovered gem. I mean, I\u2019ve had numerous investor calls after we made the announcement that weren\u2019t included on the pipe. And I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve heard it. We missed this one and we don\u2019t know how, and we\u2019re really excited to talk to you. So I think it\u2019s an undiscovered gem, you know, the headlines were Affirm, the headlines were Afterpay. The headlines were, you know, Klarna. And so then, you know, we kind of sneak up and they\u2019re like, wait a minute. This is a really good market and focused on the right market yet. They figured out how to make money at it. And so I think it just stuck up. That\u2019s why I\u2019m looking forward to closing the deal, changing the ticker to KPLT and having our name out there.\n&gt; \n&gt; And, you know, Kristen obviously is going to help us get our name out there to investors as well. And, you know, I think once they start seeing our earnings and you know, how we run the business, you know, you\u2019re only allowed to kind of let them in so far with the merger agreement. I think we have a real strong plan this year and in the future, and we\u2019ve got some, you know, a really strong team and then we\u2019ve added to even recently because we\u2019re going public. So I think it\u2019s undervalued because one, it\u2019s a surprise and two, you know, we got to get out there and start spreading the news. So I think once we close, you know, you\u2019ll start seeing that valuation getting somewhere in between where we\u2019re at and Affirm, because you\u2019re right. You know, it should be valued similar to Affirm. Right?\n\nIn January, during the peak of the SPAC bull market, FSRV rushed to $19+ a share! At the height of that mania, here\u2019s what the FSRV CEO Lee Einbinder had to say at a press event [(page 8-9).](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021003302/ea133671-425_finservacq.htm) And remember this was at nearly $19 a share! :\n\n&gt; Just to frame the valuation, when we announced the deal back in December, we had priced the transaction at 14 times, 2021 EBITDA. Obviously, the stock has moved up since then. But when you look at the valuation of Katapult today, relative to peers, the peer group that we looked at, included other point of sale payment companies like an AfterPay or Sezzle, or even a PayPal or Repay that focuses on similar customers. And then Affirm, which just went public recently. And I think what stands out for Katapult is really the growth rate. The growth rate of historically 100% and going forward north of 75%.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are no peers that are exhibiting that same growth rate and that are also profitable today. And that\u2019s what really stands out. And that\u2019s why we think the valuation is still compelling. So even as we sit here today, Katapult is trading at around 13 times next year\u2019s EBITDA. And when you look at that, relative to some of these other companies, we\u2019re still trading in a meaningful discount. A company like Affirm, which isn\u2019t even profitable, I believe is trading at north of 20 times next year\u2019s revenues. And when you look at Katapult, we\u2019re around a 10th of that. I think we\u2019re trading around 2.5 times next year\u2019s revenue.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, if you think about the opportunity here, you\u2019re buying Katapult, which is profitable today and will continue to be profitable in the future, at any metric you want to look at relative to Affirm, it\u2019s sort of a 10th of the valuation and higher growth rates, it kind of doesn\u2019t make sense to us. And I think that\u2019s why the market is endorsing the story.\n\n### 4.2 Sezzle is a Smaller, Up-and-Coming Potential Threat (That\u2019s Already Valued More Highly?!)\nSezzle is an up-and-comer offering similar services to non-prime customers, with a more global vision than Katapult. They also provide services to help customers raise their credit scores. Sezzle and Target recently signed a deal: [Sezzle, Target Sign Contract For BNPL Product | PYMNTS.com](https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/sezzle-target-sign-3-year-contract-bnpl-product/)\n\nSezzle is definitely something to keep an eye on -  for one their average return on leases is shockingly low compared to what Katapult pulls out. Katapult made $247m revenue on $201m of originations in 2020.  Sezzle made $49.6m of income on $856m of originations in 2020.  This is primarily due to the fact that the majority of Sezzle\u2019s income, 80%, comes from merchant fees.  So the business is quite different.\n\n\nAdditionally, take a look at Sezzle\u2019s offerings: [Sezzle | Highest-shopper-rated Buy Now, Pay Later solution](https://sezzle.com/stores?category=1) and look at [Katapult\u2019s offerings](https://katapult.com/store-locator/).  There is a larger risk associated with loans for the things Sezzle sells - these are clothes, fashion goods, etc. In a recession are without a doubt going to pay off their refrigerator, laptop, bed, or tires before getting  to this stuff.\n\nDefinitely something to keep an eye on, but not a concern at this point considering **they are already at market caps** . They\u2019re not making nearly as much revenue as the other players yet, they\u2019re not profiting on the little they are making, \n\n____\n\n# 5. Risks\n|**TL;DR**|\n|:---:|\n| No TL;DR here - you need to read the risks and understand what you are buying. |\n\n### 5.1 Non-prime customers\nThere is a risk-reward curve out there for point-of-sale lending and Katapult\u2019s customers are higher on the risk side of that. They are lending to people who can\u2019t get approved by other companies. These other companies are not filled with idiots - they aren\u2019t lending to these people for a reason: the risk of default is high.\n\nKatapult is able to use their technology to lower this risk. Even they reject customers they view as too high of a risk. But their sophisticated models allow to to pick out the customers that were passed over as high risk by prime lenders, but were safe to loan to for this specific purchase. \n\nThe  Katapult CEO was asked about this question specifically. He\u2019s clearly put thought into the problem, and what happens to their company in a downturn. In short, they saw an **improvement**in their customer base during the COVID recession as once prime customers were turned away more and more by banks that were tightening up. On top of that, they focus on items that people are going to be damn sure they pay off - appliances, tires, furniture, etc. \n\nHis full response was the following:\n&gt; And if you think about during even the financial crisis, you know, cars did really well, right? Even subprime auto did well. And so you asked yourself why. Those are things that people need. You need your car to go back and forth to work.  And I remember my boss at what Wacovia Bank saying, \u201cWell, and they were auto lending.\u201d And they said, \u201cWe\u2019ll never lend money in New York City in the boroughs.\u201d And I was like, \u201cReally? Why?\u201d And they said, \u201cBecause you don\u2019t have to have your car there.\n&gt; [\u2026] And so those people tend to focus on that car is, this is my ticket to my job. I need to make sure that I don\u2019t lose this car. And the same goes with our products. And then the durable goods products. If you look at, you know, appliances and furniture, you know, people need appliances and we actually do some auto, we do a lot of tires and tires are really interesting for us and they pay better.  \n&gt; [\u2026] And when you look at the lease to own product, what happens during a recession is the prime lenders tighten up pretty dramatically. And we saw this, you know, April 15th last year, April and March last year when COVID first started happening. The prime lenders, I mean, tightened up, and then we saw a better customer. And so, for us, it kind of shifts that subprime customer up into closer to prime, because they\u2019re not accessing, you know, credit through the prime lenders.\n&gt; [\u2026] Right. So, you know, that\u2019s why I hate to use the term subprime. I like to use the term non-prime because my population expands quite a bit during a recession, and I get a better customer. And we saw that if you looked at our vintages during the first weeks of COVID and the shutdowns that happened, and the tightening that happened, which all the banks admitted it. I mean, they all admitted they were tightening up. We saw some of our best performing portfolio during those times.\n\nSome facts:\n* The fraud rate across their entire portfolio is about 3%.\n\t* For reference [auto loans are at 1%.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-10/auto-loan-fraud-is-soaring-in-a-parallel-to-the-housing-bubble)\n* They claim to be able to recover 80-90% of the lease cost on charge-offs. \n\n\n###  5.2 Merchant concentration\n#### The bad\n58% of KPLT\u2019s revenue came from Wayfair in 2020, and 90% from their top 10 merchants. This is obviously a huge risk. \n#### The good \n1. This 58% number is decreasing - in 2019 it was 72% coming from Wayfair. [Proxy statement, pg 31](https://www.cstproxy.com/finservacquisition/sm2021/smproxy/images/FinServ_Acquisition_Corp-SMProxy2021.pdf)\n2. The CEO is clear that they have a deal with Wayfair for the near future, and they\u2019re actually currently working with Wayfair on integrating deeper and expanding the partnership. \n3. Though we don\u2019t have Katapult\u2019s 2021 Q1 earnings, **we do have Wayfairs.**  And being such a large percentage of Katapult\u2019s current revenue means we can get a good look at how they are doing by looking at Wayfair. [Wayfair smashed earnings this quarter](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/19/wayfair-earnings-5-stellar-numbers-you-might-have/)   running the stock up 20%.  If you\u2019re going to have merchant concentration in the early stages, Wayfair is NOT a bad place to have it.  Part of this concentration risk in the revenue #'s has to be because Wayfair just keeps growing revenue so quickly and eclipsing others.\n\n[From the CEO:](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001785424/000121390021016946/ea138192-425_finserv.htm)\n&gt; Yeah, I\u2019m not worried about it because if you\u2019re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now, Wayfair is a great partner to have. So we\u2019re really thrilled with their relationship. And the relationship is pretty deep too. We\u2019re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that, you know, the tentacles, if you will, within the company are a lot tighter, and then we have a two year agreement with them. [\u2026.] So, you know, am I worried about it? No, because it\u2019s a great retailer. And I think our relationship is very strong, but, you know, I would like to minimize it and have, you know, five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones.\n\n#### Most buy now pay later services have run into some version of this problem. \n\nAffirm\u2019s is Peloton. Peloton comprised 30% of Affirm\u2019s 2020 revenue [Affirm S-1 pg 26](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm#tRIFA) \n\nSezzle just landed Target as a parter, and will certainly run into the same problem with Target. \n\nAfterpays is small enough of a % that they don\u2019t mention it specific #'s, but they do say this ([Afterpay prospectus, pg 58](https://afterpay-corporate.yourcreative.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Afterpay-Prospectus.pdf)\n&gt; Although Afterpay does not currently depend on any one retail merchant for more than approximately 20% of its revenue, the Group\u2019s business is still at a relatively early stage and retail merchant client revenue is not as diversified as it might be for a more mature business. The loss of even a small number of Afterpay\u2019s key retail merchant clients may materially and adversely impact Afterpay\u2019s revenue and profitability, and increase marketing expenses to sign up new retail merchant clients to replace those lost. \n\n\n#### Government regulation\nAt the end of the day, this is a business loaning to poorer customers with poor credit. The result is that the interest rates have to be high to make it profitable.  That being said, the \u201cmaximum cost\u201d for an item with Katapult is still **more than double the cash price of the item**.  Having the poorest people people pay $1,300 for a $640 refrigerator is not a politically popular idea. On top of this, Democrats have traditionally been in favor of increased consumer protections, and they currently control the house, senate, and presidency. \n\n#### Prime lenders entering the nonprime market\nKatapult benefits greatly from its partnership with Affirm. It gets to piggyback on Affirms\u2019 exclusive partnership with Shopify, for example. It also gets to offer Affirms\u2019 prime servers to merchants it approaches to sweeten the deal. If Affirm were to enter the non-prime market and abandon Katapult,  this would a massive negative if it were to happen before Katapult fully has time to mature. But as far as I can tell from the available information, the partnership is strong. \n\n\n____\n\n# 6. Summary\n|**TL;DR**|\n|:---:|\n|Prime-customer only services skip people with poor credit  scores in order to manage their risk. In 2021, you can use tech to build a better model for that risk than a FICO credit score. And then you can profit off of the people that are safe to lend to but the FICO score missed.  Katapult does this, and extremely well - they profit now, not in 2026 - and they\u2019re growing at well over 100% the past few years and 75%+ going forward.  Despite this, they are valued at 1/5t h to 1/10th of their peers in the space, even though these peers have not even figured out how to be profitable yet. KPLT Represents an amazing value. |\n\n\nAt the end of the day, Katapult is about the following: in pretty much all things in life,  and especially finance, risk and reward are intricately linked. Lenders need to be able to evaluate that risk in order to collect  an appropriately sized return. Credit scores are a popular way to do this in traditional lending. \n\nBut they are pretty broad strokes - and massive portions of the population do not have good credit score and are written off - even though they would have been safe to lend to in a specific situation.  This misallocation of risk allows for a new lender to build an edge if they can identify it. \n\nKatapult is about using the new technology tools afforded to us by the internet in order to find the find the people that these broad strokes missed and to lend to them in a way that works for this class of people. \n\nThey do this, and they do it well. They\u2019re profitable when no one else has figured out how to be profitable in the space. At the same time, they\u2019re not sacrificing growth, because they\u2019re also growing as fast or faster than others in the space. I am a strong fan of the stock at this valuation. \n\n## Tin-foil hat theory\nCompletely unfounded, but just my hopes that we will get killer earnings or some new partnerships announced once the company is public. \n\nThe CEO has sort of hinted at some things coming out after merger in the second half of 2021.The CEO was asked about why their valuation is just so low compared to competitors. Says they can\u2019t say too much with the merger agreement.   IMO seems like he started to overspeak about things coming up, \u201c**and we\u2019ve got some.**.\u201d ,paused, and pivoted to just saying that they had a really strong team.

        "selftext": "I have been investing as a long-term value investor using primarily fundamental analysis (particularly discounted cash flow) to invest in what I believe are either deeply undervalued stocks with good fundamentals or great companies selling at fair prices. My style of investing is a mixture of Joel Greenblatt, Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet, as well as Peter Lynch and Philip Fisher. \n\nI have been reading on options for about a year. I have read *Understanding Options* by Michael Sincere, I am about to finish *The Options Playbook* by Brian Overby, and have finished reading *The Intelligent Options Investor* by Erik Kobayashi-Solomon. I am also about half way through the course of options trading by the *Options Alpha* website. \n\nI am not interested in many of the complex options trading plays nor am I interested in investing in most stocks such as GME or AMC which I believe are highly speculative and not based on fundamentals but which I believe are mostly simply based on hype or attempts at short-squeezing a stock.\n\nI am more interested in finding stocks that I believe have good fundamentals and that have a lot of growth potential and or dividend stocks. I plan on finding some of these stocks that have unwarranted volatility and that offer good premiums for selling cash secured puts and later on potentially selling covered calls. \n\nI plan on finding such talks that when I sell cash secured puts will give me a premium of 1% or more return minimum on my cash or in annual terms 12% or more. \n\nA good example of such stock that I currently have a position is VIAC which I sold a monthly option on May 17 for a strike price of $35 with a premium of $73 expiring on 6/18. The reason I thought this was a good choice was because it is offering me a monthly return of about 2.9% or an annual return of about 29% (.75 premium/ 30 options length) \\* 12 months. \n\nI think VIAC fits my description of selling cash secured puts because it provides a good monthly premium and is a stock I believe has good fundamentals and it is slightly undervalued. It is a massive tele-com stock with many sports rights which will benefit as COVID restrictions come to an 100% end especially by next year. \n\nFor a good overview of my process in selling cash secured puts I reccomend watching this video by Michael Jay [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgifdgyLmNE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgifdgyLmNE)\n\nDoes anyone else have a similar process and if so what stocks are you currently selling cash secured puts or are planning on doing? \n\nThere are some other stocks I would like to do this with but the premiums don't seem as high so I don't want to take the risk for the reward offered. \n\nOnce again I am not planning on doing this with hyped up stocks like AMC or GME but good quality stocks with good premiums for options investing.",

        "selftext": "COMPANY INTRO:\n\nArray, $ARRY is a solar systems company that was founded in 1989 and IPO\u2019d on October 15, 2020 and currently has a market cap of 2B. Array makes money by selling mounting/tracking systems for big solar production plants that increase efficiency by tracking the sun allowing the panels to absorb more energy. This video from Array shows their systems well:\n\n[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nhDWaT5MjVA](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nhDWaT5MjVA)\n\nGROWTH:\n\nYearly:\n\nRevenue: 2018: $290M 2019: $648M (+123% YoY) 2020: $873M (+35% YoY)\n\nNet income: 2018: -$61M 2019: $40M 2020: $59M (+48% YoY)\n\nQuarterly:\n\nRevenue: Q3 2020: $139M Q4 2020: $180M (+29% QoQ) Q1 2021: $245M (+36% QoQ)\n\nNet Income: Q3 2020: -$7M Q4 2020: -$2M Q1 2021: 3M\n\nGood growth numbers on everything except the latest QoQ net income (will get to later).\n\nNow on to the growth of solar as a sector, specifically on utility production (not residential/personal) because Array\u2019s consumers are only in the utility sector. Array has 12% market share of the solar tracking systems. The growth of the solar utility sector directly influences the growth of Array. Solar been quickly rising over the last decade as cost of solar technology decreased significantly over that time period. Solar energy is now cheaper to produce than coal, natural gas and nuclear as of 2020. Energy production and utility companies will follow the money and continue to build solar plants to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nUS Solar Production from Utility (GWh) 2011: 1,800 2012: 4,300 (+138%) 2013: 9,200 (+114%) 2014: 18,300 (+99%) 2015: 26,500 (+45%) 2016: 36,700 (+38%) 2017: 53,000 (+44%) 2018: 66,600 (+26%) 2019: 72,200 (+9%) 2020: 90,900 (+26%) Source: United States Department of Energy\n\nSolar accounted for 2.3% of total energy production in 2020. Obviously plenty of room to grow. Coal, Natural gas and Nuclear combined for 80% of total US electricity production in 2020. Now that solar is the cheapest energy source I expect it to take a large portion of that pie, maybe 25% or more in the next 10-15 years would be my guess. The only thing holding solar back is that the power grids in the US are build only to directly transport electricity from the source to its destination. So there is no element of the grid designed to store electricity. This has not been an issue in the past bc coal, nuclear, natural gas and even hydro produce energy 24/7. Obviously Solar can only produce in the day. The solution to this issue is large, utility scale electric storage. The exact kind provided by Tesla. These storage systems will provide necessary liquidity and versatility to the grid with solar production. The Lithium Ion batteries in these storage systems are rapidly decreasing in price. Prices of Li-Ion batteries have dropped 90% in the last decade. As it becomes more appealing for Tesla and other companies to construct these storage systems and start providing more utility scale electricity storage, more utility companies will invest in solar rigs. It will be more profitable to produce and won\u2019t be held back by the limitations of old grid infrastructure.\n\nGood video by CNBC on the Grid, Storage systems, and the growth of solar utility production:\n\n[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x3aqWJO4Rso](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x3aqWJO4Rso)\n\nUNDERVALUED:\n\nIn the first few months after IPO Array\u2019s price held around the low $40\u2019s, hitting a high of $53.99. In late January until now the stock has sold off significantly. There are 3 main reasons for this and why the concerns are irrelevant in the long term.\n\n1. Broader market tech/growth sell off due to inflation FUD. I\u2019m not going to try to predict if inflation will stay, shoot up, or go back down to relatively normal levels but there is one think I know for sure. Tech/growth is cheaper now. Barring hyperinflation and or a depression, this dip gives long term investors a good buying opportunity.\n2. Tax credit changes hurt YoY revenue. ITC is a federal tax credit that allows people or businesses to right off x% of the cost they spent on solar (and directly related related systems/expenses) on their income tax. This % was 30% up to the end of 2019. Then it is lowered to 26% from 2020-2022, then to 22% in 2023, then 2024+ to 0% for residential and 10% for commercial utility and scale. The fact that there is still a 10% tax creditor the foreseeable future is great. And it doesn\u2019t matter that residential dropped to 0% because Array doesn\u2019t operate in that market. So why would this Tax Credit be bad? Well going back to the top of the post under Quarterly net income I said I would get to later. Q1 2020 was a great Q for array and their revenue. Revenue or that quarter was $438M, compared to the total yearly revenue in 2019 of $650M. Sense that great quarter. Revenue has dropped significantly. And now because YoY of the last Q report is compared to that breakout Q, it makes this Q and YoY growth look really bad. I believe that Q1 2020 revenue was drastically and temporary inflated because of an element of the ITC tax credit. There is a way that constructing solar systems can grab on and hold on to the higher 30% credit from 2019 even if they don\u2019t finish construction before 2020. It is called safe haven. Basically if construction is started and there is a continuous effort made to complete construction and as long as that construction is finished within 4 years, the business will receive the 30% tax credit. In this quarters earnings report, when referring to the 44% decrease in YoY revenue, Array\u2019s CEO said \u201cResults were lower to last year because of the unseasonably high high volume of shipments we had in the first Q 2020 to consumers that were safe harboring tracker systems in connection with the ITC step down\u201d So it seems clear that Array was flooded with orders late 2019 to take advantage of the safe harbor and those revenues showed up on Q1 2020 financials. So even though the YoY revenue from last earnings was bad I believe that the order flow Array is getting was inflated in Q1 2020 and is now deflated because of all the businesses that would be buying trackers now, but bought them earlier because they wanted the better tax credits. I can see this cycle of inflated and deflated order flow/revenue relative to the decreases in ITC tax credits continue until 2024 when the credit stabilizes at 10%. I believe bad YoY data is just a distraction from great long term growth and creates a great buying opportunity.\n3. Supply chain FUD and one time stock based compensation hurt profits. Rapid increase in the price of raw materials, goods and even cost of transporting those goods going up. Supply chain FUD has stacked on top of inflation FUD sense late February until last earnings and has caused a substantial sell off in Array stock. This Supply chain FUD was realized in last quarters earnings (Q1 2021) when profitably/margins sank because cost of goods shot through the roof. \u201cThis industry (solar tracking) is contending with increase in steel and shipping costs that are unprecedented in both magnitude and the rate of change.\u201d - Jim Fusaro, Array CEO in Q1 2021 report. YoY the cost of steel has more than doubled Steel represents the almost half of Array\u2019s cost of goods sold so it\u2019s extreme increase in price has an large impact on the bottom line. Shipping costs have also shot up significantly and have the same effect on the bottom line. Even though revenue in Q1 2020 was $438M and revenue Q1 2021 was $246M, operating costs were higher in this Q large due to one time expense that come with becoming a public company. This includes increase in equity based compensation and costs related to common stock. This is simply a short term expense that negatively impacted this Q earnings and will have no further impact on profits/margins. Array is taking action to secure long term contracts with freight providers and fixing commodity prices with suppliers. This action from array combined with the fact that ridiculous prices of shipping and materials will drop in the next year or two as supply meets demand thanks to capitalism. This Supply chain FUD and bad profitability/margin data from last quarter I believe will also have no impact on future growth long term and only creates a good buying opportunity.  \n\n\n**Position: $ARRY 20c 6/18**",

Also, results from the month of april are WAY above what analyst expected. Below is a youtube video explaining in more details, and the financials from yahoo.

        "selftext": "FIRST SECTION OF THE SECOND WELL (6-1) PROVIDES FURTHER CONFIRMATION OF A WORKING PETROLEUM SYSTEM AND FIRST REPORT OF PROGRESS ON ESG\n\nJune 3, 2021 \u2013 Vancouver, BC \u2013 Reconnaissance Energy Africa Ltd. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cReconAfrica\u201d) (TSX-V: RECO) (OTCQX: RECAF) (Frankfurt: 0XD) announces the Company has set intermediate casing and is pleased to report geologic results in the first section of this second well (6-1), which again confirms a working petroleum system in the Kavango Sedimentary Basin. As well, the Company is strengthening its Environment, Social &amp; Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) standard and committing a minimum of Canadian $10mm (Namibian $112mm) of ESG expenditures to the Kavango region in which it operates.\n\nDrilling Operations\n\u00a0\nIn keeping with its commitment to the Namibian government, on May 5, 2021 the Company commenced drilling operations of its second well (6-1), of an initial three well program to continue the evaluation of working conventional hydrocarbon systems confirmed in the first well (6-2) in the Kavango Sedimentary Basin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHaving set and cemented 17 \u00bd\u201d surface casing at 150m, earlier this month, ReconAfrica has reached the intermediate casing point, set 12 \u00bc\u201d steel casing and has completed the cementing operation. Steel casing and cementing are key elements of all oil well drilling to protect natural aquifers. This work has been completed in accordance with international standards and best practices.\n\nBased on initial analysis of this first section, ReconAfrica is pleased to report 134m (440 feet) of light oil and gas shows from the 6-1 well. The shows are similar in character to those seen in the 6-2 well, 16 km to the south. This second well (6-1), like the first well (6-2), is in the same sub-basin, shows clear evidence of a working conventional petroleum system.\n\nReconAfrica director Dr Jim Granath stated: \u201cIn these first two wells, the many oil and gas shows, with such variety, is certainly remarkable. It is highly encouraging to see clastic and thick carbonate sections which appear to have similar reservoir characteristics as observed in many other petroleum provinces.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith the completion of the intermediate casing operation, the Company is drilling ahead on schedule to finish drilling operations of the 6-1 well by the end of June, 2021.\n\u00a0\nData Analysis\n\u00a0\nReconAfrica is again using industry leaders to provide analysis of this critical well, including Schlumberger, Geomark Research (Houston, Texas) and Netherland Sewell and Associates (Dallas, Texas). Due to the success of the 6-2 well, ReconAfrica has added additional scientific analysis to the already robust program of data capture and analysis for the 6-1 well, including capture of natural gas samples using IsoTubes\u00ae technology to enable analysis of natural gas composition.\n\u00a0\nIn the first well (6-2), over 150 sidewall cores were taken and Core Labs (Houston, Texas), the industry leader in reservoir analysis, has begun a detailed scientific analysis program. In the first section of the 6-1 well currently drilling, 37 sidewall cores have been taken and are in transit to Core Labs. The results of this program will be used to finalize analysis of the 6-2 well, and to inform the initial analysis of the 6-1 well.\u00a0 Complete analysis of these two wells is expected to be completed by the end of July.\n\u00a0\nThe 6-1 and 6-2 wells are in the same sub-basin, one of five major sub-basins of the larger, more laterally extensive Kavango Sedimentary Basin. The upcoming 2D seismic survey will tie in the data from these two wells and provide the first regional interpretation of the overall basin.\n\u00a0\nEnvironment, Social and Governance Progress Timeline\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs ReconAfrica moves further into its early-stage exploration program, we are strengthening our Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) performance standards. Our goal in expanding our ESG program is to not only meet, but exceed regulatory compliance as we continue to implement measures to protect the environment, implement a net-zero carbon program and enhance the livelihoods of the people of Namibia,\u201d said Scot Evans, Chief Executive Officer of ReconAfrica.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nReconAfrica is committed to building a successful exploration company while also being committed to building an ESG mandate globally for the next decade. ReconAfrica and its growing Reconnaissance Energy Namibia Pty. Ltd. (REN) team have structured an ESG plan to go hand in hand with its exploration mandate. For well over a year, the Company has met a number of important ESG and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) objectives and commitments. ReconAfrica has also engaged in a range of initiatives and activities which have improved the lives of people in their operating areas - including providing much-needed COVID-19 pandemic-response support and clean drinking water. The Company plans to outline a comprehensive plan and investments with milestones around its long term global ESG mandate within the next 60 days, however given the significant milestones it has already hit, it is important to update the market with the following:\n\u00a0\nReconAfrica\u2019s\u00a0ESG framework\u00a0provides a basis for measuring its performance against the highest global standards.\u00a0\n\nEnvironment\n\nReconAfrica has conducted comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessments to fully understand and protect the Kavango East and West regions, under the Namibian regulatory framework.\n\nThe Company is working with all levels of government, Traditional Authorities and other stakeholders to protect Namibia\u2019s water, with three key goals to support its water management protection measures including:\n\naquifer protection\n\nsurface water and drainage management\n\nsustained protection of self-imposed project no-go zones\n\nReconAfrica has a wildlife survey specialist as part of its ESG team to develop, implement and monitor rigorous wildlife-protection measures, in collaboration with the tourism industry, business organizations, governments, Traditional Authorities and multi-national conservation groups.\n\n\u00a0Social\n\nReconAfrica has completed extensive consultation and engagement initiatives with impacted and interested local, regional and national stakeholders; its engagement efforts include indigenous communities, at the invitation of San (Kwe) tribal leaders; this engagement is provided in local languages, with issues and concerns carefully tracked and addressed at follow-up sessions.\n\nThe Company is using its drilling expertise to provide new potable water from the region\u2019s considerable aquifer systems; to date, the Company has drilled four solar-powered community water wells, with plans to drill and donate another six water wells as soon as permits are provided.\n\nReconAfrica is working with local, regional and national suppliers and service providers to foster economic development; to date, ReconAfrica has employed more than 200 Namibian residents on its stratigraphic drilling project.\n\nReconAfrica is working with Namibian educational institutions to enhance training programs in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).\n\nGovernance\nReconAfrica is committed to operating in compliance with its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other relevant policies to reinforce the sustainability of the Company\u2019s operations. Read more about our governance program here:\u00a0https://reconafrica.com/about/corporate/\n\nFor a more comprehensive perspective, please see ReconAfrica\u2019s ESG Progress Timeline here:\u00a0ESG Progress Timeline\n\nThe Company is engaged in discussions with the Kavango East and West Regional Councils and Governors to identify social investment priorities. Among the initiatives under consideration are investments by ReconAfrica in farmland irrigation, educational scholarships, infrastructure and transportation funding, and health care delivery, among other potential social improvement initiatives.\u00a0\n\nThe Company\u2019s ESG indicators will be tracked and measured on an ongoing basis and will continue to evolve as the Company expands its activities in Namibia and Botswana. These indicators will be influenced by both operational developments and feedback from a range of Namibian, Botswanan and international stakeholders and ESG experts.\u00a0\n\nAs part of its ESG goals, ReconAfrica is also developing plans to address international Net Zero carbon emissions targets. While still at the earliest stage of stratigraphic exploration, with a limited emissions profile, the Company is prepared to set aggressive targets of its own to align with the global Net Zero roadmap. Future goals are also likely to be shaped by carbon-reduction commitments established by various levels of governments in the Company\u2019s operating regions.\u00a0\n\nReconAfrica plans to issue regular ESG and Technical Updates, reporting on measured indicators and progress toward its goals, commitments, and operational development plans.\u00a0\n\n\u201cReconAfrica anticipates moving forward with Namibia and Botswana as these nations seek to explore their energy potential. We will continue to work collaboratively with a full commitment to the land, water, wildlife, and people of these two countries that have invited us, in good faith, to explore possibilities to achieve the energy sovereignty and independence that many other nations enjoy. We are also taking a fully global perspective as we advance, which means aligning ourselves in practical but determined ways to meet the challenges all countries face in addressing climate change,\u201d said Jay Park QC, Chairman of ReconAfrica.\n\u00a0\nUltimately, the people of Namibia and Botswana, through their traditional authorities, elected governments and regulatory agencies, will determine how the countries will manage their natural resources.\u00a0",

(\u201ceToro\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a multi-asset investment platform that empowers people to grow their knowledge and wealth as part of a global community of successful investors, announced today\u00a0certain Q1 2021 key performance indicators. This announcement follows the previously announced planned business combination with FinTech Acquisition Corp. V (\u201cFTV\u201d). The company also disclosed audited 2020 financial results.\nYoni Assia, Co-Founder and CEO of eToro, commented: \u201cLast year was characterized by accelerating retail investor engagement. Widespread media coverage of the financial markets and more time to upskill in lockdown encouraged a record number of retail investors to enter the markets via online investment platforms and apps.\n\u201cWe saw this trend accelerate in 2021, and the first quarter continues eToro\u2019s strong track record of growth. eToro saw a 214% increase in the number of new registrations on the platform compared to the same period in 2020. This means that eToro welcomed 3.1 million new registered users in the first quarter of 2021. This compares to 5.2 million new registered users for the full year of 2020.\n\u201ceToro is a multi-asset platform, and we noted rising demand from users for stocks and cryptoassets in the first quarter of this year. The number of trades on the platform topped 210 million in Q1, with growth driven predominantly by retail demand for stocks.\n\u201cThe crypto bull run at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 also highlighted a growing trend towards diversification of cryptoassets within retail investor portfolios, with some altcoins increasing in popularity. This year, eToro has added seven new cryptoassets to the platform to support this increased demand for diversification and plans to add more.\n\u201cIt has been a very strong start to 2021, and eToro remains well positioned to capture a considerable share of a growing global market.\u201d\nKey highlights:\n\neToro registered 3.1 million new users in the first quarter of 2021 versus 1 million in the prior-year quarter and 5.2 million for the full year of 2020.\n\nThe total number of trades executed on eToro\u2019s platform reached 210 million for the quarter, a 233% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020, driven by strong demand for stocks and cryptoassets.\n\neToro will publish its full interim Q1 2021 financial reports in the coming weeks.\n\neToro plans to launch the eToro Money app and debit card in the U.K. and E.U. in 2021. The app will connect directly to users\u2019 eToro investment accounts and enable instant deposits and withdrawals, as well as additional money services.\n\nAdded seven new cryptoassets to meet rising customer demand and further enhance asset class diversification.\n\nDr. Hedva Ber, Israel\u2019s former Banking Supervisor, recently joined eToro\u2019s senior leadership team as Global COO and Deputy CEO, alongside Shalom Berkovitz, eToro\u2019s CFO and Deputy CEO, who oversees the company\u2019s global finance teams as well as eToro\u2019s activity in the UK, US, and Asia. Dr. Ber will lead eToro's operational infrastructure, corporate governance, compliance, and regulatory affairs, legal, risk management and social responsibility efforts.\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210603005562/en/eToro-Demonstrates-Accelerated-Growth-With-Latest-Results\n\n\nLong 2,500 commons.

This will perform a V recovery. \n\nThe foundation:\n\n- China threatening to ban tutoring was a market-shock for tutoring companies. Of course, China isn't going to ban tutoring and after months of this stock trading like it's going out of business they are finally starting to relieve pressure by admitting that they aren't going to outright ban tutoring. \n\n- The volume of panic selling is drying up and institutional investors are adding to their stack. There is large institutional incentive for a reversal. Short interest is high and almost 100% in the money. There is now a perfect storm for the case of a reversal, the same way there was a perfect storm for the crash. \n\n- Reversal plays like WISH are hot because panic selling and short interest presents an opportunity. A lot of interests have eyes on TAL and waiting for it to establish some type of bottom / indicator of recovery before reentry. Profitable shorts will take profit or close positions entirely when signs of a recovery from panic selling are underway. \n\nAlways do your own DD. This post is just to bring awareness.

        "selftext": "Hope you're all having a great weekend ladies and gentlemen.\n\nI am not going to lie, I'm feeling frustrated after receiving the details of the \"deal\" following the press release. I was advertised a $5-7 billion SPAC to merge with a mature unicorn, and an additional 2/9 tontine warrants if held past merger.\n\nInstead, I received a convoluted Franken-product that consists of a **distribution of a foreign-listed music company** (that nobody asked for, I would have preferred Subway), a **mini-shell company** (keep in mind it will get de-SPAC'd), and a **\"5-year call option\"** that may not even amount to anything (given how long Bill made us wait to get a lackluster target, do you want to gamble on him again?). Structurally, the whole thing is different from what what originally advertised - false advertisement much? I would have never invested in this, if this sort of structure was presented to me initially.\n\nNot to mention how badly the warrant-holders and option-holders are getting absolutely crushed by this Bamboozle (my condolences, you don't deserve this). Furthermore, the opportunity cost was staggering for many people in this unprecedented bull run (would've had better returns sticking the money in the S&amp;P 500). We were advertised a Big Mac, but instead we got a Shite-burger.\n\nI will discuss a **potential opportunity to make back your losses** (and possibly making much more), while **\"sticking it to the billionaire hedge funds\"** in the process.\n\n# I'm Motivated to Move the Needle for the Little Guy\n\nI was a Tontard since February (bought at \\~$30 average price), and sunk a significant portion of my capital believing in Bill. As time went on, more and more red flags emerged. From [Bill re-tweeting a SPAC video](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096) to drive up hope and help pump up the share price of PSTH before the PSCM annual investor presentation, to [missing the Q1 deadline](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/ackman-says-spac-will-likely-miss-first-quarter-target-for-deal) he \"promised\",  to [rescheduling a Harvard meeting because he screwed up his schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/comments/mn50du/something_big_got_response_back_from_harvard_it/) and forgot he had something else that day. Alas, my hopium got the best of me and I held and danced to the memes as my capital kept dwindling.\n\nI exited PSTH positions on Friday at a 30% loss. My losses are completely my fault (not Bill's), and I take full responsibility. However I don't appreciate the fact that Bill has mislead me with the original SPAC advertisement, and pulling a \"switcheroo\" resulting in anything but a SPAC merger. My trust in Bill is gone, and I am not going to leave my money \"dead\" in something, with the hopes that I might breakeven sometime in the distant future. Also no thanks to the \"SPARC\", I don't need more tickets for another ride to disappointment.\n\nI guess I should have known, that to become a billionaire hedge fund manager, you sort of need to be [a master manipulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DJlogbrDcA&amp;ab_channel=LanceM). Such as when Bill went on CNBC to declare [Hell is coming while already short the market](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/bill-ackman-exits-market-hedges-uses-2-billion-he-made-to-buy-more-stocks-including-hilton.html). Or let's not forget when Bill [shorted Herbalife](https://www.investopedia.com/news/billionaire-bill-ackman-dumps-herbalife-ending-5year-war-betting-against-it/) (I personally don't like MLMs, but shorting and distorting is not the way), costing his investors about $1 billion.\n\nDown a lot of money and feel cheated? Well you're in luck, because there's a way to [bet against short-sellers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) trying to profit bankrupting companies via [death spiral financing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8-JO3g5bm4&amp;ab_channel=Superstonk). Particularly, [naked short sellers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt0ojl/everything_superstonk_knows_about_naked_shorting/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) illegally selling shares they did not actually borrow, to artificially drive the price of the stock down.\n\nNow you're probably asking, how can all this benefit me and make me money? Well, it turns out if you simply buy and hold the [most shorted stock in the world](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-how-were-more-than-100-of-gamestops-shares-shorted/), you can pull a Carl Icahn and transfer the shorts' money into your pocket (not to mention possible evidence of the real figure being much higher due to synthetically created shares). The [annual shareholder meeting](https://investor.gamestop.com/home) of our most shorted stock is happening June 9th (next week), and there will be a vote count. Now imagine if the [vote count exceeds the number of outstanding shares](https://youtu.be/2rJujnpKiqM), that would be [MOASS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nletnn/gme_the_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_moass_thesis/) interesting wouldn't it?\n\nThere is a huge amount of due diligence done on this issue, and it is impossible for me to go into all the details in this one post, so please do your own research. But what I will say, is that I personally dumped whatever capital I had left from my PSTH losses into said [most shorted stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/), to not only make back my money, but to stick it to Bill's Harvard buddy Kenny G and other short hedge funds/institutions. This whole thing is potentially much bigger than all of us can imagine, consider [reading this masterpiece and its associated pieces](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwqyv/house_of_cards_part_3/). There is some evidence that SPAC vehicles are being used to illegally launder money and for various [other nefarious activities](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4vkw5/citadel_spac_being_investigated_for_violation_of/). I wonder about that in relation to the new complexity of PSTH and foreign listings, did Bill fly to Paris to meet with [Bogdanoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Q6wWu5ziY&amp;ab_channel=Bizonacci) (this is all just speculation, just food for thought, please don't kill me!).\n\n**All that being said, this is not financial advice, I am simply sharing my opinion on certain matters. Every financial decision you make must be done carefully and with due diligence. Nothing is guaranteed and it is possible to lose money from any investment (as we've seen with PSTH). All comments are for entertainment purposes only, and all statements or accusations may not be factual.**\n\nNow that I've covered my ass, good luck to all Tontards/ex-Tontards, and have a great day.",

        "selftext": "**About Doubleview:**\n\nDoubleview Gold Corp. is a Canadian resource exploration and development company located in Vancouver British Columbia.\u00a0**Doubleview is publicly traded on the TSX-Venture Exchange \\[TSX-V: DBG\\], \\[OTC: DBLVF\\],\u00a0 \\[GER: A1W038\\].** Doubleview identifies, acquires, and finances quality base metal exploration mining projects in North America and more specifically British Columbia, Canada. Doubleview increases shareholder value through strategic and quality Gold, Copper, and Silver projects acquisitions, and through the state of the art exploration methods in the industry.\n\nDoubleview\u2019s announcement of the\u00a0Gold Rich Porphyry Copper Discovery on its \"Hat project\" in Northwestern British Columbia sparked interest in the Company and this part of the famous Golden Triangle. \n\n**DD:**\n\nJust recently Doubleview has released a major update on its cobalt recovery:\n\n [Significant Cobalt Recovery a Major Upgrade at the Hat Copper-Gold-Cobalt Deposit in the Golden Triangle \u2013 Doubleview Gold Corp.](https://www.doubleview.ca/significant-cobalt-recovery-a-major-upgrade-at-the-hat-copper-gold-cobalt-deposit-in-the-golden-triangle/) \n\nthis is further increasing how devalued this company is and let me explain.\n\nWe are amongst the rise of electric vehicles, the demand for these types of minerals are becoming more and more present. Double view gold is sitting on over 7 Billion pounds of precious minerals to EV makers, as stated by the President and CEO Mr. Farshad Shirvani, on their latest recovery.  \"I am pleased with the exceptional initial metallurgical results from the Hat Polymetallic Deposit recovery test work.\u00a0 The newly received data is especially timely as copper, gold and cobalt prices are close to all-time high levels.\u00a0 Market demand for these and other metals, including nickel, palladium and scandium, critical to the rapidly expanding and evolving alternative energy and automotive industries, appears to have almost unlimited upside as worldwide decarbonization efforts gain momentum. The Hat deposit has such potential to contribute to Canada\u2019s future as it is poised, and is morphing into, what I believe a Saudi Arabia of strategic metals.\u201d \n\nWith news like this coming out, Doubleview also just granted a total of 1,650,000 stock options to its directors, officers, and consultants on May 19th, 2021. The options are exercisable at a price of $0.55 per share and expire five years from the date of grant. This is just another indicator and incentive for the company to do well.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nIndependent technical review has confirmed the Lisle zone of the Hat Deposit as an alkalic Cu-Au porphyry deposit with **significantly elevated Au grades**, featuring **235m of 1.04 g/t AuEq** (0.76 % CuEq) within a greater interval of **612m of 0.58 g/t AuEq** (0.42% CuEq) in Drill hole H034. \n\nThe following is why just the Lisle Zone alone of the HAT property is worth $3.00/share to DBG without Cobalt included and results from assays not yet included or the rest of HAT not included.\n\nFirst read the following and note I will use a very conservative .35% CUEQ in my included calculations. But look at the CUEQ grades in the read.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-07-06/re-transmission-independent-technical-review-confirms-the-lisle-zone-of-the-hat-deposit-as-an-alkalic-cu-au-porphyry](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-07-06/re-transmission-independent-technical-review-confirms-the-lisle-zone-of-the-hat-deposit-as-an-alkalic-cu-au-porphyry)\n\n650m x 920m x 620m x 2.5 = 927 million tons @ 0.35% CUEQ\u00a0\n\n927,000,000 x 0.0035 x 2209 = 7.2 Billion pounds CUEQ @ $0.06 = $432 million MC\n\n$432 divided by 150 million shares = **$2.9/share without cobalt**\n\nBest to be conservative but who knows what news is coming? We are still waiting on a response from the Talhtan First Nation about the eviction notice provided on march 17 of 2021. That PR will likely be my next update.\n\n***Position: 5665 shares avg. $0.6618*** \n\nSources:\n\n [Significant Cobalt Recovery a Major Upgrade at the Hat Copper-Gold-Cobalt Deposit in the Golden Triangle \u2013 Doubleview Gold Corp.](https://www.doubleview.ca/significant-cobalt-recovery-a-major-upgrade-at-the-hat-copper-gold-cobalt-deposit-in-the-golden-triangle/) \n\n [Doubleview Gold Corp. \u2013 TSX.V: DBG- GER: A1W038 \u2013 OTC: DBLVF](https://www.doubleview.ca/) \n\n HAT sections and plans:  [Hat Gold Rich Porphyry Copper Deposit \u2013 Doubleview Gold Corp.](https://www.doubleview.ca/hat-gold-rich-porphyry-copper-deposit/) \n\n [Red Spring \u2013 Doubleview Gold Corp.](https://www.doubleview.ca/projects/red-spring/) \n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-07-06/re-transmission-independent-technical-review-confirms-the-lisle-zone-of-the-hat-deposit-as-an-alkalic-cu-au-porphyry](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-07-06/re-transmission-independent-technical-review-confirms-the-lisle-zone-of-the-hat-deposit-as-an-alkalic-cu-au-porphyry)",

More than ***90%*** *of their* ***revenue*** *come from their* ***C5 inhibitor,*** being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.\n\nYou might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have the-best in class Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion\u2019s, and is able to ***treat x4 times more diseases*** than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how *undervalued BCX9930 is.*\n\nApart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that ***Alexion bought Achillion's Factor D*** *when it was in* ***Ph2 for $930MM.***\n\nIn ***2020*** Alexion's SOLIRIS\u00ae (eculizumab) + ULTOMORIS\u00ae (Ravulizumab) net product sales were **$5.13B**.

It would mean a ***SP value of $203,90*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat x4 times more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger TAM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**V.VII -** **Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 PNH patients***, *12* of them using *Ultomiris* and the other *11* *Soliris.* The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching*** due to the reasons explained in the pic below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lrsuwqk649371.png?width=1448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87d862d1f6e97d9418cb7c5046cb5dd21bd8dbd8\n\nSome of the *patients treated with BCX9930* were asked some questions, among them, the *6th* one expressed his ***desire*** *to be able to* ***be treated with BCX9930 twice a day oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are *highly willing to* ***switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img bys1evc749371...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**V.VIII - BCX9930 Valuation**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaving in mind BCX9930 is a *the* **B*****est-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their C5 inhibitor, and the yearly ***market size*** BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the ***$40B*** mark.

BCX9930 is an Orally taken treatment, the other approved treatments out there requiere usage of Needles, so we shoud expect BCX9930 to follow Orladeyo's steps or perhaps perform even better, now that the company has gained valuable experince with the launch of Orladeyo.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img h6n8n6p849371...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **5.

After recently ***increasing his stake in BCRX***, along with BlackRock, he now ***owns a 5%*** of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning ***789% in the last 3 quarters***, showing *strong conviction* in the company.\n\nSince Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him ***5 months to close the buy out deal***, as shown in the picture below\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 1p9pdhea49371...*\n\nAfter this exhaustive analysis of the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a *strong BO candidate*. A Buy Out coming from **Biogen** ***BIIB***, company *where* ***Denner*** *forms part of the* ***BOD*** *board of directors*, would make total sense ***in the following 1-2 years*** once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled. BIIB's financial position in the last year has notoriously worsened, the profitability has gone down a -71.25% in the last year. They need new revenue sources and BCRX's excellent pipeline could change so. **Takeda** ***TAK*** could be another excellent suitor for the BO, considering how Orladeyo is stealing its HAE patients market share.\n\nIt also is important to mention that ***Bank of America*** *added BCRX to the list of* ***top M&amp;A candidates ( Mergers and Acquisitions )*** as of October 30th, 2020.

        "selftext": " Recent IPO for Alfi (ALF) Providing AI Assisted Brand Building and a Marketing SaaS Platform for the Internet and Out of Home Applications  \n   \n**The technology to help brands grow will always be in-demand. This tiny float, newly NASDAQ listed stock could be our next runner.**  \n   \nGood day everyone,  \n   \nWe are initiating coverage of\u00a0**Alfi, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALF),**\u00a0a provider of interactive intelligent artificial intelligence and machine learning software solutions.  \n   \nCurrent price\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $2.83/share  \nOutstanding (est.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12.36M shares  \n**Float (est.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.83M shares**  \n   \nALF\u00a0[closed on its IPO](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alfi-inc-announces-closing-initial-163500986.html)\u00a0and began trading on the NASDAQ May 4, 2021. The IPO consisted of 3,731,344 common shares and warrants. The common shares were sold at $4.15 each and the warrants are exercisable at $4.57 each for up to five years.  \n   \nALF shares are trading at a 49% discount from the IPO price. While it\u2019s not unusual for IPO shares to contract after the event, there usually comes an inflection point where the shares begin to gain. We believe ALF shares have reached that point and with a tiny float, these shares could move quickly.  \n   \n**The scope of the AI driven Alfi SaaS product is awe inspiring and may have you saying, \u201cwhat the heck? I didn\u2019t even know that was possible.\u201d**  \n   \nAlfi is developing an AI enterprise SaaS platform powering computer vision with machine learning models, and deep learning to deliver the right content, to the right person at the right time. When a consumer interacts with an ALFI Tablet, Kiosk, or internet content, the software begins a sophisticated AI assisted data capture. The digital device then displays content/advertising relevant to its analysis of the viewer.  \n   \nThe company has provided a\u00a0[brief overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7XTQqUEN2U)\u00a0of the firm's SaaS platform. This video may be a critical part of your due diligence.  \n   \nDigital advertising isn\u2019t new, but Digital out of Home (DOOH) advertising, utilizing AI to generate and report data from consumer interactions is still in its infancy. This niche in advertising is where ALF lives right now.  \n   \nThe market for tracking and reporting on DOOH advertising activity is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2023. Imagine getting into a taxi or a ride share vehicle and there\u2019s an interactive pad on the back of the headrest or going to a mall and interacting with kiosk. This kind of technology will become ubiquitous in the near term, and ALF is one of the leaders and innovators in the sector.  \n   \n**The overall market for digital advertising is $614 billion.**  \n   \nAlf is already reporting positive results in more than 12 separate pilot programs deploying over 1,000 devices and expects to start generating revenues in Q2 and be profitable by Q421. The company plans to have tablets installed in 100,000 ride share vehicles within 4-5 years.  \n   \nThese are the applications ALF wants to deploy both to brands and to businesses to generate revenues:  \n   \nAirports and Malls \u2013 Kiosks  \nTaxis and Rideshares \u2013 Tablets  \nEnterprise Software \u2013 SaaS  \nData Analytics \u2013 Subscriptions  \n   \nAlfi plans to woo ride share drivers and taxis and others with participation in the revenues generated by placing a tablet in their vehicles or locations.  \n   \nUnderstanding the sophistication of the Alfi software may best be understood by their disclaimer statements:  \n   \nALF is compliant with all GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA standards. Alfi\u2019s proprietary Ai algorithm understands small facial cues and perceptual details. The automation works in a way that respects user privacy; without tracking, storing cookies, or using identifiable personal information. The company states it will not store facial images.  \n   \nWe look at ALF as a rare opportunity to get involved in a new IPO with the technology of the future, a future that is starting right now. There may be the potential for a triple digit increase in value here.  \n   \nStay tuned for our full report on ALF.  \n[Disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/recent-ipo-providing-ai-assisted-brand-building?e=[UNIQID])\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Catch me if you can!](https://preview.redd.it/6agncoisqn271.jpg?width=203&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ecbc53ac8b28d3596f164085001d6c2fd877cd)",

I encourage everyone to watch the interview, it is short and too the point and very informative. The interview can be found here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCIoUrrYvWE&amp;t=898s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCIoUrrYvWE&amp;t=898s)\n\n**Highlights from the interview:**\n\n**1)** Up list in 2021, filings will be coming and then we will get an update once they are official.  They have not missed a target yet.\n\n**2)** Post Road has access to $1 billion in funding which means their major source of financing is healthy and able to finance future acquisitions and growth in 2021 and beyond. \n\n**3)** Q1 Revenues coming very soon, they are the first \"full\" quarter in that they include earnings from both recent acquisitions.  Can not wait for these numbers to be released.\n\n**4)** Reverse split is planned in the future, but will be announced along another major milestone (up listing im guessing).  They already have an incredible share structure, anything more than a 2:1 split would \n\n**5)** He highlighted how undervalued they are compared to peers, below is an info graphic that represents their value compared to other competitors in the field.  Keep in mind that when this info graphic was made $DTGI was trading at **24 cents** (currently trading at **15.65 cents**).

I am incredibly excited to see what they have in store for us in 2021 and beyond.  This is one of my largest holdings and I have been adding while it was trading down for the last two months. \n\nMy EOY PT is $1.00 before they announce the RS to go with the up listing to a major exchange.

        "selftext": "Mine to token. AABB. Asia Broadband. \n\nSo what happens with the gold once they isolate the flakes from the rocks they crush? \n\nAfter they pull the rocks out of the mines and run through multiple rock crushers to get smaller and smaller particle sizes. First part of the video at bonanza shows a crusher. Probably has heavy steel balls in the drum that crush into a small powder. \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8GvnoFyPU18\n \nNext up is the shaker table. \nGood video here of a shaker table isolating gold. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2vlmF4ZqmjM\n\nUsually these are separated into about four fractions with the lightest going into a tailings pond. There is gold in all of these fractions but the majority of it (ca. 95%) is in the first three fractions. \n\nThe molecular weight of gold is 197 g / mol. That\u2019s heavy. Well compared to the rest of the *stuff*. \n\nWhat\u2019s the rest of the *stuff*?\n\nGold in Mexico as well as many other places are found in veins that contain quartz (mostly silicates, silicon dioxide) various sulfides (mostly iron sulfide FeS2), and calcites (eg. CaCo3). When you think of calcites you should think of limestone and marble. The floors and countertops in your house  yep mostly made up of calcites. Granite is mostly quartz. \n\nThese other minerals are much lighter than the gold. Significantly lighter. Take a gander at the periodic table and calculate the molecular weight of some of these other minerals. Or if you don\u2019t want flashbacks to high school chemistry you can take my word for it. \n\nThe shaker table is angled to use both gravity and fluid dynamics to separate the very heavy gold from the lighter minerals. \n\nGreat. Now we have the gold. It can panned out or further gravity separated. But it\u2019s still not 100% pure. Probably 20 to 22 karat. \n\nWe have a pile of gold flakes with impurities. Mostly the heavier oxides (FeO2). What to do to get these out of there?\n\nEnter borax. Remember borax experiments you did as a kid? Making slime? Crystals? Bouncy balls? https://elementalscience.com/blogs/science-activities/3-science-activities-you-can-do-with-borax\n\nThe older generation probably knows borax as an old school laundry detergent. But borax is quite useful as flux in purifying gold. Borax is sodium tetraborate. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borax \nNa2B4O7\u00b710H2O or Na2[B4O5(OH)4]\u00b78H2O\n\nIt exists as it\u2019s hydrate (H2O molecules saturate the coordination sphere of the boron atom).  Borates are particularly useful as lowering the melting point of the metal oxide impurities it is mixed with. The good thing is that the borax only reacts with the oxides and not the gold. It forms a layer of slag on top of the liquid gold when you heat it in a crucible in a kiln or with a blow torch. It can be skimmed off the top or poured carefully into a mold. Even if you do get some of the slag in the mold it is easy chipped away from the gold as it does not strongly adhere. \n\nNow we have gold that\u2019s 99%+ pure. Store it in a safe place and release some more tokens. Sit back. Rinse and repeat. Watch the stock price rise. Look for beachfront property in Hawaii, look for lambos, and makes the wife\u2019s boyfriend happy. Well not right away. Give it some time. Patience is a virtue. \n\nLike I\u2019ve said before. Unless we somehow master nuclear fusion on scale or start mining gold on Mars we won\u2019t the gold supply is what it is. It\u2019s finite. Only 0.004 ppm abundance. Brought to the surface by tectonic and volcanic activity. Unless society all of a sudden stops valuing gold we all good. But good luck with that. Human kind has had a fascination with gold for centuries. Ancient Egypt. Spanish galleons crossing the sea, California gold rush and the expansion west. Many many more. \n\nHope you enjoyed the chemistry lesson and the Shizzle weekend read. \n\nUntil next time \nShizzle",

(\u201ceToro\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a multi-asset investment platform that empowers people to grow their knowledge and wealth as part of a global community of successful investors, announced today certain Q1 2021 key performance indicators. This announcement follows the previously announced planned business combination with FinTech Acquisition Corp. V (FTCV) The company also disclosed audited 2020 financial results.\n\nYoni Assia, Co-Founder and CEO of eToro, commented: \u201c*Last year was characterized by accelerating retail investor engagement. Widespread media coverage of the financial markets and more time to upskill in lockdown encouraged a record number of retail investors to enter the markets via online investment platforms and apps.*\n\n*\u201cWe saw this trend accelerate in 2021, and the first quarter continues eToro\u2019s strong track record of growth. eToro saw a 214% increase in the number of new registrations on the platform compared to the same period in 2020. This means that eToro welcomed 3.1 million new registered users in the first quarter of 2021. This compares to 5.2 million new registered users for the full year of 2020.*\n\n*\u201ceToro is a multi-asset platform, and we noted rising demand from users for stocks and cryptoassets in the first quarter of this year. The number of trades on the platform topped 210 million in Q1, with growth driven predominantly by retail demand for stocks.*\n\n*\u201cThe crypto bull run at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 also highlighted a growing trend towards diversification of cryptoassets within retail investor portfolios, with some altcoins increasing in popularity. This year, eToro has added seven new cryptoassets to the platform to support this increased demand for diversification and plans to add more.*\n\n*\u201cIt has been a very strong start to 2021, and eToro remains well positioned to capture a considerable share of a growing global market.\u201d*\n\n**Key highlights:**\n\n* eToro registered 3.1 million new users in the first quarter of 2021 versus 1 million in the prior-year quarter and 5.2 million for the full year of 2020.\n* The total number of trades executed on eToro\u2019s platform reached 210 million for the quarter, a 233% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020, driven by strong demand for stocks and cryptoassets.\n* eToro will publish its full interim Q1 2021 financial reports in the coming weeks.\n* eToro plans to launch the eToro Money app and debit card in the U.K. and E.U. in 2021. The app will connect directly to users\u2019 eToro investment accounts and enable instant deposits and withdrawals, as well as additional money services.\n* Added seven new cryptoassets to meet rising customer demand and further enhance asset class diversification.\n* Dr. Hedva Ber, Israel\u2019s former Banking Supervisor, recently joined eToro\u2019s senior leadership team as Global COO and Deputy CEO, alongside Shalom Berkovitz, eToro\u2019s CFO and Deputy CEO, who oversees the company\u2019s global finance teams as well as eToro\u2019s activity in the UK, US, and Asia.

        "selftext": " Did my best adjusting the voice. I found this book very informative. Hope it helps those autist's who have trouble reading like me. GUH!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk70l2jq2WE&amp;t=5318s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk70l2jq2WE&amp;t=5318s)\n\n \n\nThe cover motif is a piece of old German money. It is a Reichsbanknote issued on August 22, 1923 for one hundred million marks. Nine years earlier, that many marks would have been about 5 percent of all the German marks in the world, worth 23 million American dollars. On the day it was issued, it was worth about twenty dollars. Three months later, it was worth only a few thousandths of an American cent. The process by which this occurs is known as inflation.  \n\n\nA few years before, in 1920 and 1921, Germany had enjoyed a remarkable prosperity envied by the rest of the world. Prices were steady, business was humming, everyone was working, the stock market was skyrocketing. The Germans were swimming in easy money. Within the year, they were drowning in it. Until it was all over, no one seemed to notice any connection between the earlier false boom and the later inflationary bust.  \n\n\nIn this book, Jens O. Parsson performs the neat trick of transforming the dry economic subject of inflation into a white-knuckles kind of blood-chiller. He begins with a freewheeling account of the spectacular inflation that all but destroyed Germany in 1923, taking it apart to find out both what made it tick and what made it finally end. He goes on to look at the American inflation that was steadily gaining force after 1962. In terms clear and fascinating enough for any layman, but with technical validity enough for any economist, he applies the lessons gleaned from the German inflation to find that too much about the American inflation was the same, lacking only the inexorable further deterioration that time would bring. The book concludes by charting out all the possible future prognoses for the American inflation, none easy but some much less catastrophic than others.  \n\n\nMr. Parsson brings much new light to bear on this subject. He lays on the line in tough, spare language exactly how and why the American inflation was caused, exactly who was responsible for causing it, exactly who unjustly benefited and who suffered from the inflation, exactly why the government could not permit the inflation to stop or even to cease growing worse, exactly who was going to pay the ultimate price, and exactly what would have to be done to avert the ultimate conclusion.  \n\n\nThis book packs a wallop. It is not for the timid, and it spares no tender sensibilities. The conclusions it reaches are shocking and are bound to provoke endless dispute. If they proved to approximate even remotely the correct analysis of the American inflation, hardly any American citizen could escape being the prey of inflation and no one could afford not to know where the inflation was taking him. In the economic daily lives of everyone, nothing will be the same after this book as it was before.",

It can be confirmed that he armed foreign governments (Philippines) as is stated in the 1987 FBI report. This suggests Federal Arms and Empire State Arms were used to book Meridian's sales and launder the proceeds from such sales. He refused to give a sworn statement to the house committee regarding specifics of Meridian's specific business dealings (outside of discussing the loss incurred to him as a result of his L.A.P.D apprehension).\n\nNichols also established an arms dealing company of the same name during his time in Queensland, Australia:\n\n [https://opencorporates.com/companies/au/168176592](https://opencorporates.com/companies/au/168176592)\n\nThe existing entity, Meridian Fire Arms was established in 2011 (3 years after the Israel case):\n\n[https://opencorporates.com/companies/us\\_mi/801614393](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_mi/801614393)\n\nAs a vendor they're listed as Meridian Defense Corp. or \"MDC\":\n\n[https://meridiandefensecorp.com/](https://meridiandefensecorp.com/)\n\nYes, Meridian is still in business to this day and their logo is an OCTOPUS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3binldn13r371.png?width=125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab4230428d5c6deff466bb5fdb9fae39df39d515\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uh6an79x2r371.png?width=870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f12f2adf06fd2c4d855afe8c61476f7b442881\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4gbp0x73r371.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e52e1dd7695f3152ee9f1481602da0aff4f12f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/msd0an8a3r371.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b0d3ddc3454bd3addc1bb0918e952017af7dd8e\n\n[https://www.company-histories.com/The-Wackenhut-Corporation-Company-History.html](https://www.company-histories.com/The-Wackenhut-Corporation-Company-History.html)  \n\nHave fun.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo)\n\nThe source that reported this (Wayne Madsen) lacks credibility and has disseminated propaganda in much of his \"journalism\". Madsen has previously promoted propaganda through unsubstantiated conspiracy claims. Think COINTEL.\n\nMadsen previously served in the U.S Navy and NSA. He has been featured on such programs as 60 Minutes.\n\nGiven his involvement with confidential government programs in the past, I would be cautious of the potential for deliberate misinformation being disseminated by Madsen.\n\nIt was speculated by Channel 3 News' Nathan Baca that this may be an attempt to \"fake\" Robert Booth Nichols' death; a similar strategy employed by his business partner Samuel Israel.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne\\_Madsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Madsen)\n\nI don't know if Robert Booth Nichols was a CIA asset. I'm here to present information and receive scrutiny. But yeah. Weird.\n\n# What about the Octopus? That's just a crazy tall tale created by Robert Booth Nichols right?\n\nBelieve it or not, Sam Israel and Robert Booth Nichols are not the only individuals to mention the Octopus.\n\n[Freelance Journalist; Danny Casolaro](https://preview.redd.it/cwycwo7zyu371.jpg?width=240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=606ad5e8ec900ca3f59f7b9278753d851ea51690)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny\\_Casolaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Casolaro)\n\n&gt;\"Joseph Daniel Casolaro (June 16, 1947 \u2013 August 10, 1991) was an American freelance writer who came to public attention in 1991 when he was found dead in a bathtub in room 517 of the Sheraton Hotel in Martinsburg, West Virginia, the medical examiner ruled the death a suicide.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"His death became controversial because his notes suggested he was in Martinsburg to meet a source about a story he called \"the Octopus.\" This centered on a sprawling collaboration involving an international cabal, and primarily featuring a number of stories familiar to journalists who worked in and around Washington, D.C. in the 1980s\u2014the Inslaw case about a software manufacturer whose owner accused the Justice Department of stealing its work product, the October Surprise theory that during the Iran hostage crisis Iran deliberately held back American hostages to help Ronald Reagan win the 1980 presidential election, the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and Iran\u2013Contra.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Casolaro's family argued that he had been murdered; that before he left for Martinsburg, he had apparently told his brother that he had been frequently receiving harassing phone calls late at night; that some of them were threatening; and that if something were to happen to him while in Martinsburg, it would not be an accident. They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times. A number of law-enforcement officials also argued that his death deserved further scrutiny, and his notes were passed by his family to ABC News and Time Magazine, both of which investigated the case, but no evidence of murder was ever found.\"\n\nFrom the earlier quoting LA Times article: [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html)\n\nNichols had frequent contact with Casolaro just before the journalist, who was probing a web of conspiracies ranging from the Iran-Contra affair to alleged Justice Department skullduggery, was found with his wrists slashed in a West Virginia motel room.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cThe INSLAW Affair,\u201d said the Justice Department had failed to adequately investigate charges that high-level officials had stolen and misused a private firm\u2019s sophisticated computer software designed to help track criminals.\n\nRegarding the Inslaw Report:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond\\_ghislaine\\_the\\_maxwell\\_octopus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond_ghislaine_the_maxwell_octopus/)\n\nNichols acknowledged to committee investigators that he had spoken to Casolaro often and served as a sounding board for him, but would not provide a sworn statement to the House committee.\n\nThe trial, which enters its second week of testimony Monday, stems from a 1986 incident in which Nichols, armed with a concealed pistol, was taken into custody by Los Angeles police at The Palomino.\n\nNichols said he was with his brother-in-law, James Hopko (when)\n\n&gt;Without warning, Nichols testified, he was flung to the ground and two revolvers were pointed at his head. Nichols, who was carrying a concealed weapons permit from the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Department, was disarmed, handcuffed and transported to the North Hollywood LAPD station.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols\u2019 suit charges that the loss of the permit led to a withdrawal of a Swiss financing for his firm, Meridian Arms Corp., to manufacture a new machine gun in South Korea.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To buttress his client\u2019s credibility as a businessman, Nichols\u2019 lawyer introduced in court a flood of paper indicating that he had worked on numerous ventures with prominent individuals. They included Robert A. Maheu, Howard Hughes\u2019 former right-hand man; Michael A. McManus, an aide to President Ronald Reagan; Clint W. Murchison, then the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, and George K. Pender, an executive with a worldwide engineering company.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols testified about discussions he had with a White House aide on the rebuilding of Lebanon while he was affiliated with Meridian\u2019s predecessor firm, Santa Monica-based First Intercontinental Development Corp. That firm supposedly specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Appended to Gates\u2019 affidavit was an Oct. 8, 1987, document stating that the FBI was investigating whether Giaquinto, Nichols and others were \u201cbuying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\n\nWithout a doubt, Robert Booth Nichols was involved in mob-related investment schemes leveraging relationships he had established through the CIA, Wall Street and arms dealing ventures. Concerning, to say the least.\n\nIn his 2008 deposition, Nichols explains he was a member of the Board of Directors for George K. Pender's FIDCO.\n\nGeorge K. Pender's only business registration with any U.S State Department is as Director of First International Development Corporation (FIDCO) in Santa Monica, California.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx)\n\nWell, well, well.... Nichols stated FIDCO: \"specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.\" I wonder how common these \"secret foreign construction\" companies are?\n\nEarlier in the L.A Times article, Nichols explains being with his brother in-law James Hopko before being arrested by L.A.P.D officers.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx)\n\nThis business registration with the U.S State Department of Honolulu, lists an Ellen M. Hopko as secretary. This is Robert B. Nichols wife.\n\nThis report serves to expose certain established practices within high stakes and confidential societies.\n\nRobert Booth Nichols was investigated in 1987 by the FBI for:\n\n&gt;\"buying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\"\n\nThe practice described above is the Modus Operandi of Ken Griffin/Citadel, Steve Cohen/Point72 , D.E Shaw, The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, KKR, BITG and the list goes on through Wall Street.\n\nI believe the Bond scam employed by Sam Israel and Robert Booth Nichols is the same scheme that was run by Salomon Brothers and continues to be employed by Citadel, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (among others). Co-ordinating to short 10 year treasury bonds to keep that money printer a going.\n\nThis is the Federal Reserve's \"Secret Market\".\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSam Israel III and Robert Booth Nichols were involved in an elaborate U.S Treasury bond trading scheme that continues to be employed by the largest banks and funds on Wall Street.\n\nFor Bayou Management (Israel's fund), this scheme involved shadow government organizations and extremely prominent individuals in government, finance, business + organized crime. Further research of the persons and events surrounding this bizarre crime uncovers evidence of CIA arms smuggling and money laundering operations tied to the Iran-Contra Scandal, Wackenhut Corp and private prison profiteering.\n\nIf I was you though, I would read the whole post.\n\nIf you made it this far, you might be interested in further research materials:\n\nBulk references for the wrinkle brains that like to look closer.

Concluding and Transitional Provisions\n\n## Provisions[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Russia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4)]\n\nEspecially on human rights and [fundamental freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_freedoms), the Constitution provides for human rights and freedoms of citizens according to the universally recognised principles and norms of [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law) as well as to their listing in the Constitution.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-4) (It affirms that the listing in the Constitution of the Russian Federation of the fundamental rights and freedoms shall not be interpreted as a rejection and derogation of other universally recognised human rights and freedoms.)[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-5)\n\n### Executive[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Russia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5)]\n\n*Main articles:* [*President of Russia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Russia) *and* [*Government of Russia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Russia)\ud83d\udcf7[Dmitry Medvedev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev) takes the presidential [oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office) with his right hand resting on the Constitution, 7 May 2008.\n\nThe Constitution of the Russian Federation specifies that the President is the Russian head of state, setting domestic and foreign policy and representing Russia both within the country and internationally \\[Article 80\\].[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-6) While the [original constitution](https://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/ch4.html) stipulated a four-year term and a maximum of two terms in succession, the current constitution decrees a six-year term. The four-year term was in effect while [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin) served his first and second terms; with the two-term limit, he was barred from the presidency in 2008. Instead, he served as Prime Minister while [Dmitry Medvedev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev) served as president for four years. Putin was re-elected to his third term in 2012; with the six-year term, he was elected to his fourth term in 2018. Article 81 specifies the method of election, including a secret ballot; Articles 82\u201393 detail powers, responsibilities, and limitations of the presidency. The constitution provides for a \"strong presidency\"; not only is the president the \"Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation\",[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-7) the president also has the power to dissolve the [State Duma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Duma).[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-8)\n\n### Legislative branch[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Russia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6)]\n\n*Main article:* [*Federal Assembly of Russia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assembly_of_Russia)\n\nThe legislature is the Federal Assembly of Russia, which consists of two chambers: the State Duma (the lower house) and the Federation Council (the upper house). The two chambers possess different powers and responsibilities: the State Duma is of more significance, as it carries the main responsibility for passing federal laws. Although a bill may originate in either legislative chamber (or be submitted by the President, government, local legislatures, Supreme Court, Constitutional Court, or High Arbitration Court), it must be first considered by the State Duma and be adopted by a majority vote before being turned over to the Federation Council, which has 14 days to take a vote on it. If the bill is adopted by the Federation Council, it must be signed by the President to become law. If rejected by the Federation Council, the bill will be returned to the State Duma, which can then override the council's rejection by passing it again with a two-thirds vote in the same form. The President has a final veto, but the State Duma and Federation Council also have an overriding power by passing with a two-thirds vote.\n\n### Judiciary[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Russia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7)]\n\n*Main article:* [*Judiciary of Russia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Russia)\n\nWhile the Russian Federation Constitution enumerates a strong and independent judicial branch, the reality is a question of debate. The constitution provides for judicial immunity, lifetime appointments/\"irremovable\" justices, the supremacy of the courts to administer justice, and affirms that judges need only submit to the constitution and the federal law.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-auto-9) Additionally, Article 123 provides for open and fair trials, as well as equal application of the law.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-10) Three courts are delineated: Constitution Court of the Russian Federation, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, and the Higher Arbitration Court; each court is \"appointed by the Council of the Federation upon the proposals by the President.\"[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-auto-9) The Constitution requires 19 judges for the Constitution Court,[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-auto-9) but does not specify the number of justices for the other courts. As of 2002, the Supreme Court has 115 members;[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-11) due to the expansion of duties in 2014, the number of seats was increased to 170.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-auto1-12) In September 2014, the Institute of Modern Russia reported that the Russian Federation's Supreme Arbitration Court had been dissolved and that judicial matters previously under its authority had been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-auto1-12)\n\n## Amending the Constitution[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Russia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8)]\n\nThe procedure for amending the Constitution is outlined in Chapter Nine. Proposals on amendments to and revision of the provisions of the Constitution of the Russian Federation may be submitted by the President of the Russian Federation, the Council of Federation, the State Duma, the Government of the Russian Federation, legislative (representative) bodies of constituent entities of the Russian Federation, and by groups consisting of not less than one fifth of the members of the Council of Federation or of the deputies of the State Duma.\n\n\\_\\_Article 137 covers updating the provisions of Article 65 of the Constitution of Russia. An update regarding the change of the name of the subject of the Russian Federation is carried out by a decree of the President of Russia on bringing the name of the subject of the Russian Federation in the text of the Constitution of the Russian Federation in accordance with the decision of the subject of the Russian Federation. An update regarding changes in the subject composition of the Russian Federation is carried out in accordance with the federal constitutional law on the admission to the Russian Federation and the formation of a new constituent entity of the Russian Federation, on changes in the constitutional and legal status of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, which should contain an indication of the inclusion of relevant changes or additions to Article 65 of the Constitution of Russia.\n\nArticle 136 covers updating the provisions of chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the Constitution of Russia. An update is carried out in the form of a special act: a law of the Russian Federation on amendments to the Constitution, which is adopted by the parliament similarly to the federal constitutional law, but then also requires ratification by the legislative bodies of the constituent entities of the Federation. Moreover, one law of the Russian Federation on the amendment to the Constitution covers interrelated changes to the constitutional text; the law itself receives a name reflecting the essence of this amendment.\n\nArticle 135 covers updating the provisions of chapters 1, 2, and 9 of the Constitution of Russia. An update to any of these chapters is considered a revision of the Constitution's fundamental provisions, which is possible only through the adoption of the new Constitution of the Russian Federation by the [Russian Constitutional Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Constitutional_Assembly) or by popular vote.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-13)\n\n### 2008 amendments[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Russia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9)]\n\n*Main article:* [*2008 amendments to the Constitution of Russia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_Russia)\n\nThe amendments of 2008, which were proposed in November 2008 and came into force on 31 December 2008, are the first substantial amendments to the **Constitution of Russia** of 1993[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-telegraph-14)[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-ap-15) and extended the terms of the [President of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Russia) and the [State Duma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Duma) from four to six and five years, respectively. Earlier only minor adjustments concerning the naming of the [federal subjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_subjects_of_Russia) or their merging were made, which require a much simpler procedure.\n\n### February 2014 amendments[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Russia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10)]\n\n\ud83d\udcf7This section **needs expansion**. You can help by [adding to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Russia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=). *(July 2020)*\n\n### July 2014 amendments[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Russia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11)]\n\n\ud83d\udcf7This section **needs expansion**. You can help by [adding to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Russia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=). *(July 2020)*\n\n### 2020 amendments[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Russia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12)]\n\n*Main article:* [*2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_Russia)\n\nThe amendments of 2020 remove the \"in a row\" clause from the article regulating the maximum number of presidential terms, discounting previous presidential terms before the amendment enters into force. Other changes are recognition of Russia as a successor to the Soviet Union in relationship to international organizations, treaties, and assets of the USSR stipulated by international treaties outside the territory Russian Federation, banning ceding Russian territory, diminishing the accomplishments by the \"defenders of the fatherland\" and their role in World War II is no longer allowed, and enshrining God and [heterosexual marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexual_marriage) in the constitution.[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-16)[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-17)[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-18) Other amendments would enshrine the role of the Russian language as that of \"state forming people\", a [constitutional reference to God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_references_to_God) and giving statutory backing to the [State Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Council_(Russia)).\n\nFrom 25 June to 1 July 2020, a [nationwide vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Russian_constitutional_referendum) took place, with 78 % of voters voting in favor of the amendments with a turnout of 65 %, according to official results.\n\nPutin signed an executive order on 3 July 2020 to officially insert the amendments into the Russian Constitution - they took effect on 4 July 2020.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Russia#cite_note-19)\n\n## See also",

        "selftext": "After reading books about value investing, watching youtube tutorials about DCF, reading financial blogs\u2026 I wonder how to screen value or quality companies. \n\nOnce I tried a very simple screening filter using Refinitiv: Market Cap &gt; Cash and Equivalents\n\nIt is a funny world and must be a broken market in which you have 1,134 companies with more cash sitting on their balance sheets than they are valued in the market. So, by buying a share, simply phrased, I buy their cash and get assets, intangible assets, know how, patents, employees, marketing and sales network, brand\u2026for free. Unfortunately, my broker does not list even a fraction of those companies, since they are headquartered in China, Japan, India, South America\u2026\n\nSo, I used finviz and played with the stock screener. Unfortunately, there is no condition filter like Market Cap &gt; Cash and Equivalents.\n\nInstead, I played around and tried some other conditions which reduced the investment universe massively. Of course, I will still conduct a DD of a company after screening, BUT I wonder which screening filters would you use? \n\nFor example, in the fundamentals tab, I only used 5 parameters. I left out the market cap as well as the dividend yield in the descriptive tab. \n\n[Finviz Settings](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=fa_grossmargin_o20,fa_pb_low,fa_pe_u10,fa_ps_u2,fa_quickratio_o1&amp;ft=2)\n\nI am extremely interested in your filter settings. Even using technical parameters if necessary. I think together, with thousands of eyes and brains, it must be easy to find a common ground.\n\nI appreciate your feedback and will try out some of your constellations.",

        "selftext": "Hello\n\n** I would like to preface that I\u2019m guessing this will be between WS trade or questrade \n\nI just turned 21 and want to start investing\n\nI don\u2019t know what my budget exactly is. About 1-2k CAD so far invested in crypto.\n\nI\u2019m not really going in with a large amount, I\u2019m not sure exactly how much. Maybe 600 CAD to start, moving to 1.5k in a few months? Or maybe like 3k. I will probably put a large chunk in an etF from TFSA soon. I was interested in blackberry, Apple, visa, and some ETFs and so wanted to start looking at services \n\n\n\nMy criteria; ( if you feel I\u2019m wrong correct me)\n\n- low fees for buying \n- low fees for selling \n- US stocks so currency conversion fees? \n- not interested in options right now, I want to just buy a few stocks and probably an etf \n- no monthly fees \n- no inactivity fees ( guess I can do some activity to keep it )\n- mobile app and desktop would be good\n- nice UI would be good but I\u2019ll live\n- quick deposits preferred\n- a minimum deposit amount would be a pain \n\nOverall, I\u2019m being pretty cheap here. Hopefully that makes sense\n\nTo me it seems like most people say WS trade or questrade \nI don\u2019t know which is best. I know qu\u2019estrades charges fees per trade and WS doesn\u2019t but they have currency conversion fees. \n\n** *qu\u2019estrade also seems to ask for 1000$ minimum to start? But 250$ means you\u2019re in good standing I think? So this means I can deposit 1000 and take out 750 if I wanted? Am I wrong??\n\nIf you have other suggestions please let me know I\u2019m just trying not to be stupid",

I may also be resented by some on the sub for my obnoxious ranting against Canoo (HCAC/GOEV), which turned out to be accurate. \n\n**The Rumor**\n\nThe most recent [rumored target](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/traveloka-said-in-talks-to-list-via-richard-li-s-bridgetown-spac) for BTWN is Traveloka, the leading SEA online travel company.  Until we get a definitive agreement between the SPAC and target, we must glean company details from various interviews. \n\n**What Is Traveloka?**\n\nTraveloka is the #1 travel site in SEA. The app has 10M+ downloads on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.traveloka.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US) with almost 1 million reviews and an average rating of almost 5 stars (on the App Store as well). [SensorTower data](https://sensortower.com/ios/publisher/pt-traveloka-indonesia/898244860) shows more than 200,000 downloads in the last month alone. The [company claimed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-traveloka-funding/se-asias-biggest-travel-app-traveloka-raises-250-million-as-lockdowns-ease-idUSKCN24T0OG) more than 60 million downloads over all devices by July 2020. Although the company began as just a travel aggregator, it quickly expanded into offering its own products and service throughout Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, [and now Australia](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/329188). The company provides transportation, hotel, and experience bookings across SEA, a region that has historically been too complex for companies like Expedia (large investor in Traveloka, see below) to operate in effectively due to the fractured nature of the travel industry, multitude of languages, and local customs. \n\nTraveloka was disproportionately affected by COVID restrictions relative to other tech unicorns, seeing transaction reductions of **up to 95%** during the lockdown peak in April-May, 2020. They raised $250m in additional capital that summer to bolster the company balance sheet and expand into other sectors. But, this black swan event showed us the flexibility of the company and innovation of the leadership. They introduced live tour streaming and interactive social media auctions, as well as the Online Xperience platform where users can learn new skills and interact with other participants (noted an 8x increase in users in July, 2020). Case in point: transactions have reached 100% and 75% of pre-COVID levels in Vietnam and Thailand, respectively. They offered a huge promotion event in Indonesia called the Traveloka Epic Sale that generated a 1300% transaction increase with steep price discounts ([source for paragraph](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says)).\n\nOver the past few years, Traveloka has expanded beyond just offering travel services and into fintech. [They partnered](https://kr-asia.com/indonesias-traveloka-partners-with-state-lender-bni-for-paylater-service) with Indonesian state bank BRI in Oct 2019 to launch the PayLater VISA card and partnered with the BNI state bank in Jan 2020 to support a PayLater platform service. This is essentially building a new branch for the Traveloka brand, providing Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), credit card, and insurance (auto, travel, health) services. \n\nWhat\u2019s so special about yet another fintech operation? Traveloka is focusing not on the **un**banked, but on the **under**banked. To quote from [a great interview](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says) with the co-founder in Dec 2020: \u201cIn Indonesia, bank penetration is close to 50%, while credit card penetration is around 3%. Indonesians tend to have bank accounts, yet they do not have access to financing services. Here, we aim to bridge the gap by partnering with prominent banks and leveraging our robust technology and a large customer base.\u201d\n\nThey have also recently begun expanding fintech services outside their home country of Indonesia by [partnering with Thai bank SCB](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Finance/Indonesia-s-Traveloka-to-expand-fintech-business-into-Thailand), and are [in discussions](https://skift.com/2021/02/25/traveloka-targets-vietnam-thailand-for-launching-financial-services-ahead-of-possible-ipo/) with similar partners in Vietnam.\n\nI am especially interested in the BNPL offering, which is one of the fastest growing fintech sectors. For example, Afterpay (AFTPY) recently beat expectations with 167% YOY sales growth and Affirm (AFRM) had revenue growth of 81% and 64% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. To wit, Traveloka has already facilitated [more than 6 million loans](https://skift.com/2021/02/25/traveloka-targets-vietnam-thailand-for-launching-financial-services-ahead-of-possible-ipo/) in their home country of Indonesia after just two years of BNPL operation.\n\nWith the combination of their streaming tours, online experience options, and fintech operations, Traveloka not only managed to survive the COVID pandemic, they even managed to [turn profitable](https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/traveloka-profitable-2020-229947/) in 2020. What also helped was the company\u2019s ability to run at high efficiency. In the same article linked above, a company investor stated that Traveloka was able to burn only \u201clow single-digit million USD quarterly\u201d during the crisis.\n\nIf we use COVID revenue drop numbers [from Expedia](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/expedias-2020-revenue-sinks-57-pandemic-continues-roil-travel-industry/), we can assume a revenue reduction ranging from 40-60%. [Reportedly](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says), Traveloka issued \\~$100m in refunds in 2020. So, expected annual revenue for Traveloka in 2020 could have ranged from $166m-$250m, but still maintained profitability. Highly uncertain estimates, but it\u2019s the best I can do for now.\n\n**Company Founders and Funding:**\n\n* **Founded** in 2012 by Ferry Unardi (CEO), Derianto Kusuma (ex-CTO, left co.), and Albert Zhang.\n* **Ferry Unardi background**: B.S. Computer Science &amp; Engineering at Purdue, worked as software engineer at Microsoft for 3 years, 1 semester at Harvard Business School. Dropped out of MBA program when he realized how difficult and complex it was to book travel back to his hometown of Padang, Indonesia and decided to start Traveloka at [23 years old](https://www.prestigeonline.com/id/people-events/ferry-unardi-dropped-harvard-create-traveloka/).\n* **Derianto Kusuma background:** B.S. Computer Science at Stanford, software engineer at LinkedIn and Microsoft. Pivotal in engineering the tech architecture of the company. Resigned from Traveloka in 2018 [saying](https://medium.com/@derianto/departure-from-traveloka-and-starting-a-new-chapter-91676b712805), \u201cWith the full support of my co-founders and investors, after a long negotiation process finally we agreed in all aspects on my clean break from Traveloka, and the end of 2018 turns out to be the perfect time for this.\u201d\n* First funding round in 2012 (undisclosed) from East Ventures (Indo early stage inv fund)\n* Series A funding in 2013 (undisclosed) from: Global Founders Capital (VC arm of tech incubator Rocket Internet)\n* Series B (undisclosed) from: East Ventures, Hillhouse, Sequioa, JD.com. ([source](https://www.techinasia.com/traveloka-raises-350m-from-expedia), [source](https://www.prestigeonline.com/id/people-events/ferry-unardi-dropped-harvard-create-traveloka/)).\n* Series C round in 2017 ($500m) from: Expedia, East Ventures, Hillhouse, JD.com, and Sequioa Capital (officially hitting unicorn status). $350m of that alone was from Expedia. (see sources in previous point).\n* Additional round in 2019 ($420m) from GIC (Singapore state wealth fund), valuing Traveloka at \\~$3.3b. ([source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-07/traveloka-is-said-near-fundraising-at-sharply-lower-valuation), [source](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/traveloka/company_financials)).\n* Additional round in July 2020 ($250m): This was a rare unicorn *down-round*, with valuation reducing from $3.3b to $2.75b due to company hardship related to COVID. ([source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-07/traveloka-is-said-near-fundraising-at-sharply-lower-valuation), [source](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/traveloka/company_financials)).\n\n**My Thesis:** \n\nHow will the market react to Traveloka?  I expect **very** favorably because Traveloka is a combination of growth, value, and re-opening. **GROWTH** because the company is expanding rapidly across SEA and likely yields high percent revenue growth, **VALUE** because the company is profitable in a large and growing TAM, and **RE-OPENING** because travel was clobbered by COVID and everyone is scrambling to move around again. Traveloka is NOT one of the (seemingly endless) unknown companies taking advantage of market liquidity for the founders/investors to cash out or prop up some dev-stage tech shop. Traveloka has [long been recognized](https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/how-many-unicorns-are-there-in-southeast-asia%EF%BC%9F/) as one of the best unicorns in SEA, operational for almost a decade, and backed by some of the best known VC names.\n\nSEA is a very exciting market right now, but *especially* in terms of SPACs. There are approximately [500 unicorns](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Unicorns-surge-to-500-in-number-as-US-and-China-account-for-70) (private companies valued &gt; $1b) in the world as of Nov 2020. Almost half of those (242) are in the US, followed by China (119), India (24), UK (24), and South Korea (11). Just 5 are based in Indonesia, and SEA as a whole boasts [just 9 private unicorns](https://i0.wp.com/thelowdown.momentum.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87_20200529023712.png?resize=696%2C365&amp;ssl=1) (link is a bit out of date). Examples are Grab (AGC), GoTo (Gojek/Tokopedia merged privately), Lazada (struggling, overtaken in GMV by SE\u2019s Shopee), Traveloka ([that\u2019s us!](https://media2.giphy.com/media/KDVswimTNahWzcd7sV/giphy.gif)), Bukalapek, and Zilingo. The point of this is that the SPAC market is WAY oversaturated with many obscure companies going public at steep valuations despite meager revenue and growth. SEA, conversely, is extremely undersaturated.\n\nHere is the list of SEA SPAC mergers: \n\n* Grab is [merging](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Biggest+SPAC+Deal+Ever%3A+Grab+To+Go+Public+in+a+%2440+Billion+Merger+With+Altimeter+%28AGC%29%2C+Backed+by+Fidelity+and+BlackRock/18252682.html) with AGC.\n* Tiket (smaller competitor to Traveloka) is [rumored](https://investor.id/market-and-corporate/cova-acquisition-negosiasi-dengan-unicorn-di-indonesia) to be in talks with COVA.\n* Tokopedia was [originally rumored](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/thiel-backed-spac-said-to-weigh-up-to-10-billion-tokopedia-deal) to be merging with BTWN, but has since [merged privately](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/) with Gojek and is now [weighing public listing options](https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-tokopedias-merged-entity-goto-plans-preipo-fundraise). *Could* still go with BTWN, but I think direct listing is possible now.\n* MNC Play is [merging](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001807594/000121390021016795/ea138123ex99-1_malacca.htm) with MLAC (btw, quick shill: MLAC is way, way overlooked - I hold a bunch of warrants).\n\nThat\u2019s it. Despite the region having 360 million internet users (see below), there are few unicorn targets and SPACs relative to the United States. SEA is ripe for the SPACening. Here are some highlights regarding the region, taken from the [BTWN S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001815086/000121390020044067/fs12020_bridgetown.htm%5d:):\n\n* \u201cWhile we may pursue an acquisition or a business combination target in any business or industry, we focus our search on a target with operations or prospective operations in the technology, financial services, or media sectors, which we refer to as the \u201cnew economy sectors\u201d, in Southeast Asia.\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] is fast becoming a major regional economic force and a driver of global growth.\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] remains one of the fastest growing regions in the world with economic growth averaging 5.4% per annum\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] is estimated to become the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2030 after the US, China, and the EU.\u201d\n* \u201cCollective findings by Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company indicate that the region\u2019s internet economy has crossed the $100 billion mark in 2019 and is poised to triple to an estimated $300 billion by 2025.\u201d\n* \u201cWith approximately 360 million Internet users in the region, 90% of which connect to the Internet primarily through their mobile phones, Southeast Asia boasts one of the most engaged mobile internet audience in the world.\u201d\n\nIn a word:  **BULLISH**.\n\n**The SPAC: Bridgetown I (BTWN)**\n\nFounded as a co-venture between Thiel Capital (Peter Thiel) and Pacific Century (Richard Li), focused on tech, fintech, or media in Southeast Asia (SEA). [The sponsor team](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001815086/000121390020044067/fs12020_bridgetown.htm%5d:):\n\n* The primary name in BTWN is **Peter Thiel**, one of the most renowned tech investors of the 21st century. Peter Thiels first big win was cofounding Paypal with Elon Musk, then later being the first outside investor in Facebook by providing $500k in return for a 10% stake in the company in 2004. He sold most of his shares between 2012-2017 for  \\~$1.1 billion, representing a return of 220,000%. Side note: if he had never sold any of his \\~37.76m shares, his equity in FB today would be \\~$12.4b, an eye-popping return of 2,480,000%... if he had held. Other *other* side note, these are rookie numbers in comparison to Jeff Bezos and his family. Their initial investment of \\~$300k into AMZN back in 1994-1995 (later supplemented by a few dozen angel investors), would provide a return of \\~55,500,000% over 27 years. But, I digress. Other early investments by Peter Thiel (just listing off his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel)): ABNB, LinkedIn, Yelp, SPOT, SpaceX, PLTR, ASAN, and Stripe, among others. To put it mildly: The guy\u2019s a legend.\n* Another primary name here is **Richard Li**, billionaire founder of Pacific Century, founder of Star TV (Asia\u2019s first satellite-delivered cable-TV, later sold to Murdoch\u2019s News Corp). Li\u2019s Pacific Century invests heavily in media and telecom, including companies such as Viu (video streaming), HKT (telecom), and Legendary Pictures. Other investments range from Tensar (soil solutions) to Sodecia North America (engineered materials) to FWD (insurance). One of Li\u2019s most notable investments is being among the earliest investors in the Chinese conglomerate Tencent (now $600b market cap). Various other names include Sohu (media/gaming), Chegg (ed-tech), and Tokopedia (e-commerce). \n* CEO/CFO/Director: **Daniel Wong**, senior VP of Pacific Century Group. Representing PCG and Richard Li.\n* Chairman of the board: **Matt Danzeisen**, Head of Private Investments at Thiel Capital. Representing Thiel Capital and Peter Thiel.\n* Member of the board: **Samuel Altman**, the CEO of OpenAI and former President of Y Combinator. Altman has invested in many behemoth tech companies, including AirBnb, Stripe, Reddit, Asana, and Pinterest. He [joined the board of Expedia](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/sam-altman-joins-expedia-group-board-bringing-expertise-openai-ceo-former-y-combinator-president/), one of the primary investors in Traveloka, in 2019.\n* Other board members: **John R. \u201cJay\u201d Hass**, **Joon Hwang**.\n* Senior advisor: **Kenneth Ng**.\n\n**What Is the Investment Move?**\n\nThere are three choices for investing in this SPAC: (1) BTWN shares, (2) BTWN warrants (BTWNW), or (3) BTWN options.\n\nOf the three, I think that warrants are the least desirable choice. As of this writing, they are trading at $1.95, which is a somewhat steep premium to pay in the current SPAC market environment.\n\nThe second-best option is BTWN shares - they are trading just 10 cents over NAV at $10.10, so they offer good downside protection at the cost of more limited upside. I have a sizable position in BTWN shares.\n\nThe best choice, in my opinion, is BTWN call options. Each options contract gives you leverage over 100 shares. Because the implied volatility (IV) on SPACs is so low right now, premiums are cheap. With BTWN July $10c trading at $0.30 ($30/contract), the break-even price on each contract is just 1.98% above the current share price. This means that you are getting leverage of 33:1 (depending on the contract price). As with all options trades, liquidity is incredibly important. In the case of the July calls, open interest (the number of active contracts) is **26,281** as of this writing.\n\nIn my opinion, these **July options offer one of the greatest reward/risk ratios in the market right now**. For every $1 move up in share price above $10, each contract gains an intrinsic value of $100. That means the percent return at expiration on each contract is:\n\n* 100% at price of $10.60\n* 233% at price of $11.00\n* 567% at price of $12.00\n* 900% at price of $13.00\n* 1233% at price of $14.00\n\nSo to provide an example from [optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/), purchasing 50 July $10c options contracts for $30 each ($0.30/share) at a total of $1,500 could generate the following $ returns: [http://opcalc.com/vql](http://opcalc.com/vql). Pretty astounding!\n\nNot to mention that option contract prices are also dictated by volatility. If the underlying stock were to become more volatile, options contract premiums will (up to a certain share price, that is, bc we\u2019re buying ITM options).\n\n**Why Are Options Premiums So Low?**\n\nWell, because pops on SPAC DA announcements are, to say the least, muted right now. The growth market has gotten hammered since March, with many stocks down 30-60% from ATHs. SPACs were disproportionately affected because they are among the most speculative investment in the growth market and investors have been reluctant to jump back in. At its low, the SPAK ETF was down **37% from ATH**. But over the last couple weeks, the market has begun to rebound. For example, 5 days ago SPAK [broke out](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SPAK/28503eb61b8) of its month\u2019s long downtrend with the RSI surpassing 50. Many pre-merger and deSPAC names have begun to trend upward with 5d and 7d EMAs crossing over the 20d EMA, including [SKLZ](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SKLZ/28503ebgcma) (my baby), [BFLY](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/BFLY/28503ebhyy6), [SOFI](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SOFI/28503ebjbl5), and [ACTC](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/ACTC/28503ebl7td).\n\nThe low premiums on these options are why I think this is a great play right now. As Warren Buffet said, \u201cBe greedy when others are fearful\u201d (though I\u2019m **sure** he wasn\u2019t referring to options). My position in shares is just a cash reserve right now with potential upside (I discussed that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kbgtd6/why_this_is_a_onceinadecade_or_more_spac_bonanza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) a bit), but the options appear to have incredibly high upside by providing leverage. With my 200 ITM options, I am gaining leverage over 20,000 shares, equivalent to a $200,000 position, for a price of just $6,000 (albeit with a strict time constraint).\n\n**Why This SPAC?**\n\nThere are [hundreds of active SPACs](https://spactrack.net/activespacs/) right now actively searching or rumored to be in talks with a target. Buying contracts on any of the optionable ones that don\u2019t have credible rumors is a big risk. Case in point: I did just that with XPOA options as a cheap gamble and am now down 40% on them because they\u2019re merging with a relatively boring mobile gaming company. *Note: I think the company is good, but not exactly exciting for the rest of the market, unfortunately*.\n\nBTWN is a unique case, however. The management team is composed of some of the best investors in the world (Thiel, Li) and they have a credible rumor (Bloomberg) targeting a long-established unicorn (Traveloka) in one of the hottest marketplaces in the world (SEA). As a comparison, the SPAC AGC (planning to merge with SEA\u2019s Grab) is trading at 19% over NAV. **At that price, the intrinsic value of BTWN July calls would represent a return of 533%** (assuming a purchase price of $30/contract). The AGC merger values Grab at around $40b, approximately 8-9x that of the rumored BTWN/Traveloka merger. Because the valuation of Traveloka is so much smaller, it can have much higher volatility during price discovery.\n\nYou could always try the October calls, but the premium is 100% higher and open interest is just 28% of the July calls. If we haven\u2019t gotten a DA announcement in the next couple weeks, you could just roll the contracts to the October strike for a minimal loss.\n\nSide note: I recently DMed the author of the Bloomberg article, Yoolim Lee, on Twitter to check in on the rumor itself. She confirmed that (1) no, there haven\u2019t been recent rumor updates, and (1) yes, the rumor is for BTWN, not BTNB.\n\n**How To Size Your Options Position**\n\n**DO NOT YOLO** these options. In fact, never YOLO on anything, let alone options (well, SPAC shares are safe pre-merger). We invest in SPACs because of the floor price built into pre-merger commons. Options on these shares are inherently high risk, but in the current market environment this is even more so the case. My call options represent just a small percentage of my portfolio because they can absolutely go to zero if the share price is under $10 by July 16 or can easily lose 50% of their value. The person or MM writing/selling these options is, in fact, betting on that scenario. Personally, **I keep options purchases at or under 1% of my portfolio**. Let me reiterate: DO. NOT. YOLO. If you get the urge to, just buy a small percentage in options, then put the rest into BTWN shares since they are protected by the NAV.\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I\u2019m just a random guy on the internet. Assume the worst about me and do your own research!\n\n**My Positions:**\n\n* 9,000 BTWN shares - subject to change, probably moving into PACX because it is *wayyyy* overlooked and undervalued.\n* 200 July 16 $10c options",

Doubleview increases shareholder value through strategic and quality Gold, Copper, and Silver projects acquisitions, and through the state of the art exploration methods in the industry.\n\nDoubleview\u2019s announcement of the\u00a0Gold Rich Porphyry Copper Discovery on its \"Hat project\" in Northwestern British Columbia sparked interest in the Company and this part of the famous Golden Triangle. \n\n**DD:**\n\nJust recently Doubleview has released a major update on its cobalt recovery:\n\n [Significant Cobalt Recovery a Major Upgrade at the Hat Copper-Gold-Cobalt Deposit in the Golden Triangle \u2013 Doubleview Gold Corp.](https://www.doubleview.ca/significant-cobalt-recovery-a-major-upgrade-at-the-hat-copper-gold-cobalt-deposit-in-the-golden-triangle/) \n\nthis is further increasing how devalued this company is and let me explain.\n\nWe are amongst the rise of electric vehicles, the demand for these types of minerals are becoming more and more present. Double view gold is sitting on over 7 Billion pounds of precious minerals to EV makers, as stated by the President and CEO Mr. Farshad Shirvani, on their latest recovery.  \"I am pleased with the exceptional initial metallurgical results from the Hat Polymetallic Deposit recovery test work.\u00a0 The newly received data is especially timely as copper, gold and cobalt prices are close to all-time high levels.\u00a0 Market demand for these and other metals, including nickel, palladium and scandium, critical to the rapidly expanding and evolving alternative energy and automotive industries, appears to have almost unlimited upside as worldwide decarbonization efforts gain momentum. The Hat deposit has such potential to contribute to Canada\u2019s future as it is poised, and is morphing into, what I believe a Saudi Arabia of strategic metals.\u201d \n\nWith news like this coming out, Doubleview also just granted a total of 1,650,000 stock options to its directors, officers, and consultants on May 19th, 2021. The options are exercisable at a price of $0.55 per share and expire five years from the date of grant. This is just another indicator and incentive for the company to do well.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nIndependent technical review has confirmed the Lisle zone of the Hat Deposit as an alkalic Cu-Au porphyry deposit with **significantly elevated Au grades**, featuring **235m of 1.04 g/t AuEq** (0.76 % CuEq) within a greater interval of **612m of 0.58 g/t AuEq** (0.42% CuEq) in Drill hole H034. \n\nThe following is why just the Lisle Zone alone of the HAT property is worth $3.00/share to DBG without Cobalt included and results from assays not yet included or the rest of HAT not included.\n\nFirst read the following and note I will use a very conservative .35% CUEQ in my included calculations.

        "selftext": " Did my best adjusting the voice. I found this book very informative. Hope it helps those who have trouble reading like me. GUH!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk70l2jq2WE&amp;t=5318s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk70l2jq2WE&amp;t=5318s)\n\nThe cover motif is a piece of old German money. It is a Reichsbanknote issued on August 22, 1923 for one hundred million marks. Nine years earlier, that many marks would have been about 5 percent of all the German marks in the world, worth 23 million American dollars. On the day it was issued, it was worth about twenty dollars. Three months later, it was worth only a few thousandths of an American cent. The process by which this occurs is known as inflation.\n\nA few years before, in 1920 and 1921, Germany had enjoyed a remarkable prosperity envied by the rest of the world. Prices were steady, business was humming, everyone was working, the stock market was skyrocketing. The Germans were swimming in easy money. Within the year, they were drowning in it. Until it was all over, no one seemed to notice any connection between the earlier false boom and the later inflationary bust.\n\nIn this book, Jens O. Parsson performs the neat trick of transforming the dry economic subject of inflation into a white-knuckles kind of blood-chiller. He begins with a freewheeling account of the spectacular inflation that all but destroyed Germany in 1923, taking it apart to find out both what made it tick and what made it finally end. He goes on to look at the American inflation that was steadily gaining force after 1962. In terms clear and fascinating enough for any layman, but with technical validity enough for any economist, he applies the lessons gleaned from the German inflation to find that too much about the American inflation was the same, lacking only the inexorable further deterioration that time would bring. The book concludes by charting out all the possible future prognoses for the American inflation, none easy but some much less catastrophic than others.\n\nMr. Parsson brings much new light to bear on this subject. He lays on the line in tough, spare language exactly how and why the American inflation was caused, exactly who was responsible for causing it, exactly who unjustly benefited and who suffered from the inflation, exactly why the government could not permit the inflation to stop or even to cease growing worse, exactly who was going to pay the ultimate price, and exactly what would have to be done to avert the ultimate conclusion.\n\nThis book packs a wallop. It is not for the timid, and it spares no tender sensibilities. The conclusions it reaches are shocking and are bound to provoke endless dispute. If they proved to approximate even remotely the correct analysis of the American inflation, hardly any American citizen could escape being the prey of inflation and no one could afford not to know where the inflation was taking him. In the economic daily lives of everyone, nothing will be the same after this book as it was before.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, wondering what your consensus was about where you keep your investments.  Right now most of my Roth consists of ETFs and my brokerage has single stocks mixed in with funds and ETFs.  The thinking was that if I needed something liquid, I could cash out in my brokerage account if something happened before I'm 59.5.  Was thinking of investing some cash when I contribute again to my Roth in NVDA since it's been doing well for me, and maybe pick a couple more.  The reasoning is being able to cash out without the taxes on my gains. What do you think?",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th, 2021.\n\n# **AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/04/amc-meme-stocks-could-spark-more-heat-in-the-week-ahead-as-investors-await-inflation-news.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting.\n*****\n&gt; May\u2019s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected.\n*****\n&gt; Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January.\n*****\n&gt; Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%.\n*****\n&gt; But it\u2019s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople think this is new. It completely isn\u2019t,\u201d Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat\u2019s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there\u2019s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,\u201d Niles said on CNBC.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSo, if it gets people interested in investing, that\u2019s great. What I don\u2019t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,\u201d he added. \u201cYou want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you\u2019re going to play in something like this.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be around as long as cicadas are,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814.\n*****\n&gt; # Watching the inflation signs\n&gt; Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April\u2019s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m getting nervous. I\u2019m seeing signs of a top. I\u2019m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,\u201d Massocca said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWho knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cWho knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market.\n*****\n&gt; Friday\u2019s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected.\n*****\n&gt; Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed\u2019s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking?\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,\u201d said Massocca.\n*****\n&gt; # Taper talk\n&gt; The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying.\n*****\n&gt; After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023.\n*****\n&gt; Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhen the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that\u2019s when you can go in and say, \u2018OK\u2019 we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that\u2019s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; For now, Niles said he\u2019s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. \u201cYou want to stay away from this stuff now unless you\u2019re doing it in very small size,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization\u2019s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ES0of64.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/iKeqNqH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/l9qBdWe.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/XBcULW4.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/NT0IykH.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V9mwL4B.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/r8wAacm.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FdeRKh5.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wx7jTzJ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz42RSD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/G4mFy62.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/btYjPgX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/nXc08M8.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold\n\n&gt; Before diving into today\u2019s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April\u2019s report threw at investors.\n\n&gt; One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a \u201cone off\u201d among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery?\n\n&gt; Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today\u2019s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions.\n\n&gt; It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways:\n\n&gt; * The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs.\n\n&gt; * The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%.\n\n&gt; * Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market &gt; Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThere is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.\u201d\n\n&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May\u2019s jobs number did jump above April\u2019s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.4.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well.\n\n&gt; The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed\u2019s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a \u201cgood news is bad news\u201d scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed\u2019s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today\u2019s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief.\n\n&gt; For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October.\n\n&gt; We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3d76eb3a7ade3e0a5bd2c76e926e8097/1f542cabf408b99a-c5/s500x750/06643429565107777a36935f8f4e6edc3a652cc3.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9003c5a181e5bd2fd37cd14041970feb/1f542cabf408b99a-a2/s500x750/cebaf4203ca34b95ce9bb792e8985e33109f2879.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # June Swoon?\n\n&gt; Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&amp;P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. \u201cAfter a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.2.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here are some stats to think about regarding S&amp;P 500 performance in June:\n\n&gt; * Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse).\n\n&gt; * It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s.\n\n&gt; * The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month.\n\n&gt; * According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn\u2019t common for major market weakness to start in June.\n\n&gt; * Building on this, when the S&amp;P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%.\n\n&gt; We wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn\u2019t likely, as that isn\u2019t what June typically brings.\n\n&gt; Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&amp;P 500. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors\u2019 targets, as appropriate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.2.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks\n\n&gt; Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Neut.png))**\n\n&gt; With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Cons-Above-20.png))**\n\n&gt; Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&amp;P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Ranges.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Table1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ace478059f39803a98e521b2e33ac971/43b2f9d6d03eacfd-50/s500x750/49f23730515ead414d8274322ae25482929103eb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade\n\n&gt; The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it\u2019s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research\u2019s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners\u2014what we like to think of as \u201cMain Street\u201d rather than \u201cWall Street.\u201d The BBB gauges Main Street\u2019s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text.\n\n&gt; In the most recent Beige Book, \u201cstrong\u201d words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSentiment is up and that\u2019s a great sign for the direction of the economy.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy\u2019s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening.\n\n&gt; Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there\u2019s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Returns Relative to History\n\n&gt; May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&amp;P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&amp;P 500 to the S&amp;P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928.\n\n&gt; We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&amp;P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&amp;P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&amp;P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060221-Current-vs-Avg1.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060221-Percentile-Rank1.png))**\n\n&gt; Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&amp;P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&amp;P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&amp;P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window?\n\n&gt; For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&amp;P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060221-20-Year-Return1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending June 4th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt9U2ihAUm4))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 6.6.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASlHbHjPBMk))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Cz42RSD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eDVgj3i.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.7.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/G0Ad4Sb.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 6.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/921tQDp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  6.8.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EwwkrVK.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 6.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fwtNe1w.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/V0qMaKG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 6.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QSK1TUg.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.10.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ffbyitN.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 6.10.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/1P6KWTe.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.11.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 6.11.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket!",

Doubleview increases shareholder value through strategic and quality Gold, Copper, and Silver projects acquisitions, and through the state of the art exploration methods in the industry.\n\nDoubleview\u2019s announcement of the\u00a0Gold Rich Porphyry Copper Discovery on its \"Hat project\" in Northwestern British Columbia sparked interest in the Company and this part of the famous Golden Triangle.\n\n**DD:**\n\nJust recently Doubleview has released a major update on its cobalt recovery:\n\n[Significant Cobalt Recovery a Major Upgrade at the Hat Copper-Gold-Cobalt Deposit in the Golden Triangle \u2013 Doubleview Gold Corp.](https://www.doubleview.ca/significant-cobalt-recovery-a-major-upgrade-at-the-hat-copper-gold-cobalt-deposit-in-the-golden-triangle/)\n\nthis is further increasing how devalued this company is and let me explain.\n\nWe are amongst the rise of electric vehicles, the demand for these types of minerals are becoming more and more present. Double view gold is sitting on over 7 Billion pounds of precious minerals to EV makers, as stated by the President and CEO Mr. Farshad Shirvani, on their latest recovery. \"I am pleased with the exceptional initial metallurgical results from the Hat Polymetallic Deposit recovery test work.\u00a0 The newly received data is especially timely as copper, gold and cobalt prices are close to all-time high levels.\u00a0 Market demand for these and other metals, including nickel, palladium and scandium, critical to the rapidly expanding and evolving alternative energy and automotive industries, appears to have almost unlimited upside as worldwide decarbonization efforts gain momentum. The Hat deposit has such potential to contribute to Canada\u2019s future as it is poised, and is morphing into, what I believe a Saudi Arabia of strategic metals.\u201d\n\nWith news like this coming out, Doubleview also just granted a total of 1,650,000 stock options to its directors, officers, and consultants on May 19th, 2021. The options are exercisable at a price of $0.55 per share and expire five years from the date of grant. This is just another indicator and incentive for the company to do well.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nIndependent technical review has confirmed the Lisle zone of the Hat Deposit as an alkalic Cu-Au porphyry deposit with **significantly elevated Au grades**, featuring **235m of 1.04 g/t AuEq** (0.76 % CuEq) within a greater interval of **612m of 0.58 g/t AuEq** (0.42% CuEq) in Drill hole H034.\n\nThe following is why just the Lisle Zone alone of the HAT property is worth $3.00/share to DBG without Cobalt included and results from assays not yet included or the rest of HAT not included.\n\nFirst read the following and note I will use a very conservative .35% CUEQ in my included calculations.

But fucking listen this one time.\n\nWith El Salvador declaring the corn legal tender (Bill passed today) and lots of other countries on the way, things are a bit different from how they were before. Capital gains tax could fall in a short timeframe.\n\nAnyways, onwards to the DD:\n\nWe're on the verge of a potential Death Cross or Bounce.\n\n*Processing img j4hox4wrk7471...*\n\nOne of those two will happen:\n\n1) 50DMA crosses 200DMA, like it did after 2013 and 2017 ATH - induce bear market.\n\n2) Or 50DMA bounces off 200DMA, like it did during 2013 and 2017 bull runs - inducing Gamma MOASS\n\n If June close will be $54K (or higher) and July, August also $54K (or higher), then 50DMA will bounce off 200DMA and stay above 200DMA. So a nice short squeeze and V-shaped bounce back to $54K (+69%) would result in a bounce back scenario that has the potential to catapult the corn above 200k USD.\n\nOpen short interest on one Exchange alone is enough to go to \\~80k if a squeeze should happen.\n\n[Short interest on just one of the big exchanges](https://preview.redd.it/tqnr6ad2q7471.png?width=769&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69acf5a9a1666aac53c77f16a298d70fc2a56b25)\n\nI dare all of you retarded but wonderful apes to put just 1% of your portfolio into my beloved corn and witness the freaking mother of all mothers of short squeezes. \ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15 There's not a lot to lose, but loads of money to be made. Aside from all the financial revolution stuff that I'm not going to torture you with.\n\nFull disclosure. I own bags of Corn as well as GME shares.\n\nHere's some more Emojis for all of ya in case you need confirmation bias:\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nTl Dr: I dare all of you to put 1% of your portfolio into bitcorn to witness the most epic squeeze possible in the history of mankind.",
