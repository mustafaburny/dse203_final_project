        "selftext": "Good evening you pieces of shit,\n\nWhy do you keep doubling down on your short positions? Why are new hedge funds are coming in and scooping up new short positions? What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? Do you understand who we are?\n\nWe don\u2019t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don\u2019t give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don\u2019t fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children\u2019s college funds away just to post memes about it.\n\nYour plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven\u2019t owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.\n\nDouble down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face. \n\nTake all your boomer ass money and put it on the table. We are here for it. My shares are available for $10,000 before 6 pm today. For every hour after that, Im asking another $250. Go fuck yourself.",

GME finally brought me back to 100k today after holding for about a week, and I paper hands'ded and sold. I was just ecstatic to 'undo' the fuck-up that blew my account up. I am terrified of losing that money again, it's everything I've saved up since 2017.\n\nI am glad the mods made this sub private earlier. ***I am seeing the true level of conviction of the REAL WSB OG's***. I am seeing that there was a lot of noise today, and that the people who have been here the longest, who have bled and fought with me through JNUG/JDST, through meme-ing AMD at $13, through TSLA squeeze, through a GLOBAL FUCKING PANDEMIC ..are still diamond handing this.\n\n#I feel like I betrayed you guys today.\n\nI seriously told myself after selling today that I was going to stay 100% cash until this all blew over. It's been hard to know what is really going on lately because of all the bots and astroturfing. But I have seen the level of conviction of the TRUE VETERAN AUTISTS of this sub and I am rejuvenated.\n\nAlthough I can't afford to risk all of my money, ***I am not going to sit on the sidelines after the laughs, the panic, the joy, the loss, and the good times this sub has given me over the years.*** I honestly see you guys as friends, even if I don't see your faces, or know you on a personal level. And friends stick it out, through whatever bullshit life throws at them.\n\n#TOMORROW I AM BACK IN. 5K WORTH OF SHARES, AND HOLDING UNTIL THE END. NO STOP LOSS, NO LIMIT SELL. FOR GLORY, OR FOR DEATH. I WILL STAND BY YOU BROTHERS.\n\n#***the horn of hammerhand will sound in the deep one last time.***",

        "selftext": "Listen up.. \u201cIf you think BB moon\u2019d after this week, you\u2019re a rough brained retard. Our astronauts John Chen and Tom Eacobacci are literally in the break room; Chen\u2019s unpacking some homemade Yangzouh Fried Rice from his wife, Tom is microwaving stale coffee and asking Chen if he\u2019s going to change his name to Cha Ching after he becomes a Billionaire in 2023. Chen smirks as he cracks open his wheel of fortune cookie... the point is, rocket is still fucking grounded. I repeat, the rocket is grounded.\n\nListen retards, did you miss AMD? Did you miss NVDA? Did you miss trash ass Cringecoin? Hell, did you even miss TSLA? Are you seething with FOMO up to your ears and out of your assholes watching these stocks mint fresh millennial millionaires while you twiddled your thumbs thinking \u201cGeE WiZ tHeY haVe To CoMe DoWn EveNtuAlLYyyyYyyYy\u201d\n\nPro tip: they never came down...\n\nThese rockets went to the fucking moon and left your ass behind on planet Earth, living a shitty wage life flipping burgers, while the retards that boarded these rockets are on the moon laying on beach chairs, sunglasses on, and rubbing sunscreen with SPF 9000 on their smooth brains because they got front row tickets to the sun... FRONT ROW TICKETS TO THE FUCKING, SUN... this is the present state of affairs.\n\nThere is, lucky you, however, another rocket with the inscription BBC fueling up and selling tickets to the moon AS WE SPEAK.\n\nCurrent position: missionary with 10,555 shares and reverse cowgirl with some calls. I\u2019m holding unrealized profits of about $110k and realized profits of about $100k.\n\nHowever, if you ask me 10 years from now my biggest regret in life... I will tell you two things: 1, not getting my wife her bf earlier on, and 2, booking $100k profit too soon in BB.\n\nMay Lord Chen forgive my moment of weakness. Learn from me. Buy and walk away. Buy and hold. Do not be tempted to sell before the moon. To not sell when the rocket is still in the stratosphere.\n\nMoon is $50 IF THE STOCK JUST TRADES ON PAR WITH ITS FUCKING PEERS, MOON CAN EASILY BE $100+ IF YOU FACTOR IN VERTICALS, ECONOMIC MOAT, and a $450-750 billion Auto Data Market as stated in Mckinsey &amp; Company\u2019s report on Monetizing Auto Data. Yes that\u2019s not a mistake, the overall revenue pool from Global Auto Data monetization could be as high as $750 BILLION in 2030. This is the market BB has cornered and is about to squeeze by the balls. QNX was always the crown Jewel of all their verticals. This was always the master plan for the turnaround. We are on the fucking cusp of one of the greatest turnarounds in history.\n\nListen, I don\u2019t think some of you rough brained retards realize what is happening:\n\nAsk yourselves: why is the EV sector so hot? Why is every large tech corporation trying to get a piece of this Auto pie?\n\nYou wanna know why? Because when the computer first came out it took the space of entire fucking floors in a building to do simple calculations... when the cell phone first came out, you needed a fucking brief case just to carry it and looked like an absolute tool making a phone call, stopping everything you\u2019re doing, laying down your suitcase, opening it, taking out the brick, extending a massive antenna, LMFAO, what fucking tools boomers were... anyways, now look at the modern laptop and smartphone. Look at the revolutions these products went through to become cemented into our lives. Look at the markets these products opened up for us.\n\nNow, what current item is undergoing this type of revolution? You guessed it, you smooth brained criminal you, the Automobile. What was once dinosaur machinery unironically running on dead dinosaurs, is now making the revolution on the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today.\n\nAnd guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance? Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today, hint hint: it\u2019s the same company that\u2019s so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround: Revenue Growth.\n\nBlackberry. It\u2019s Blackberry. Babe berry. Member berry. The blacker the berry... the sweeter the juice boys.\n\n\u201cwhAt aBoUT GoOgLe aNd APpLe or TSLA TaKiNg OvEr the Auto OS mArKet\u201d\n\nListen retards, BlackBerry\u2019s MOAT is bullet proof. You know why?\n\nBecause what\u2019s the one thing Google, Apple, and TSLA have in common? They\u2019re actually in the fucking auto business.\n\nYou think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost? Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is?\n\nLet me demonstrate with the ol\u2019 lemonade stand analogy. Let\u2019s say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade. Next thing you know, Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand, and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes. You\u2019re fucked. Jimmy just took your business, your friends, your girl and her bf.\n\nYou need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade... so how will you do this? Are you gonna go up to Jimmy\u2019s stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy? Is that what a smooth brained person would do?\n\nNO, you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store, buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them, and while you\u2019re at it, buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your lemonade. Because fuck Jimmy, that\u2019s why.\n\nSpeaking of lemonade...\n\n\u201cwHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB?\u201d\n\nAndrew Left although the gayest bear of them all, actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA. He was early on that call, but he was right.\n\nBack to the lemonade moat:\n\nListen retards, Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple, Google, and TSLA are. You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS? Or you think these non techy auto dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS. Fuck no. Don\u2019t be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear \u201cDD\u201d\n\nBlackBerry is a third party corporation that all auto makers can form an auto cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord. A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they\u2019re a fucking tech company to begin with, and they have the scale and reach to do so, but don\u2019t think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them. These other Auto OS (if made) will be specific and unique to that companies own car. Think. Use that smooth brain.\n\nBlackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market.\n\nAlso this is a tough fucking market. Cars are one of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing. This isn\u2019t like a laptop, you click the wrong link, and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups. The car is more serious. You click the wrong link; and you\u2019re dead.\n\nAre you getting the picture now? Do you see why Cylance was bought? Do you see why BlackBerry\u2019s moat is so secure?\n\nCylance has just been integrated into QNX and was shown off at CES. How many of you missed that fine detail?\n\nNot only does QNX now act as the gatekeeper of all auto data, it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows, which it will, exponentially.\n\nAutomakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX.\n\nRemember when Chen said: \u201cwhen better days come, we\u2019ll be ready to execute\u201d\n\nBetter days are here. This is what he was talking about. They\u2019ve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready. The foresight on Papa Chen... Absolute Genius.\u201d\n\nCredits fo the DD: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l37ktg/bb_weekend_due_diligence_confirmation_bias/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

        "selftext": "Reddit has a impulse to become an echo chamber because of how the upvote and downvote mechanics work. People who are downvoted get their posts and comments hidden and eventually get muted, and Karma does motivate people to seek upvotes. The best examples are how r/politics become completely blue dominated with no alternative views, or people will post things on r/nottheonion and the comments get dominated as if it is r/politics. Alongside this, you see a gradual reduction in nuance, which in r/politics became \"mango bad\".  You see this throughout other subs on non-political topics once a tribal identity forms, and there is a strong tribal narrative on one side of an issue, and then people passionately downvote anything not in agreement. \n\nOn WSB bets, the mods banned political comments to prevent this kind of tribal BS seeping into the sub. But, we are starting to get extremely tribal about specific meme stocks to the point where it's very difficult to get quality DD on the other end of the issue. An awful lot of top posts do not have humor value as memes, and are basically - &lt;ticker I YOLOed my entire account into&gt;  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80  followed by trash talk about some skeptic somewhere. I feel like arguing with people about a hot ticker now is like arguing with an anti-vaxxer friend about Moderna, or a blue friend about Mango's actual governmental actions, or a red friend about vote counting. It's really hard to be constructive or for anyone to get smarter.\n\nIf the goal of this sub is to collectively pump particular stocks, I guess this is true to form, but if the goal of this sub includes discussion to inform better trading outcomes for participants, this dynamic is greatly reducing the quality of trading discussion. Right now, the feed is almost exclusively just two tickers, and those threads have very few contrary views, even well thought out ones. Even 4 or 5 months ago, I felt this sub was a lot different than stocktwits, but it's hard to tell the difference sometimes now.  I really want to be part of a community where we consistently find insight and trades that everyone else thought was dumb but was in reality brilliant, and that holds up some time later. The GME value thesis at $5 is one of those. So too was BTFDing the pandemic, and shorting it too. \n\nI think this current tribalism is going to lead to worse trading outcomes for the sub in the long run. When we front-run a big wave of increasing bid on a stock, and then that price becomes stable or we exit before it's not, we outperform the market. That happened big time last year with Coronavirus, and has happened repeatedly with TSLA. In other cases we try to forget, it's been the opposite, like multiple times ahead of AMD earnings, PRPL, and over-exuberance with PLTR into the 30s. Basically, if we pump the stock, and then the broader community of investors doesn't come around to the point of view, we are stuck with the bag. And a lot of these outcomes come from when we are all-in and super emotional about it, which I think we all know is NOT how to trade if you want the best results. \n\nWe should stop downvoting posts and comments that are well written, and instead leave them alone or up vote them. By all means, downvote bullshit troll posts and straight up haters, but if you downvote quality contrary views, you make everyone here a worse trader, and increase the echo chamber that leads the sub to over-extend.",

        "selftext": "AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I\u2019ve made a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/) about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intel struggles**\n\nLast week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be CTO at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD Q4 and FY**\n\nEPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2021&amp;2022 Outlook**\n\nBut the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC\u2019s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU\u2019s that can go head to head with NVDA\u2019s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E\u2019s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML\u2019s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Booming Market**\n\nFinally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition:\n\n2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan\u201921 100Calls.",

The main reason is because we were smooth brained idiots but the fundamental reason is because everyone (including retail investors) bought the fucking dip. Even if this GME thing somehow crashes the market, retail investors and large institutional investors alike will prop up the market.\n\nI just want to clarify this GME rally is great. Greedy hedge fund investors got caught with their dick in the cookie jar and they look like fools and rightly so. There is a crude imbalance of wealth in the world and anything that helps put more money in the hands of the less fortunate is a good thing.  \n\nBy the way if anyone has GME calls, just know the ratio of puts to calls on GME is 3:1, for you smooth brains all that means is there is a lot of bearish sentiment on the stock, so just watch your tendies.\n\nSPY 380c SPY 365p SQ 220c AMD 88c VXX 25c",

        "selftext": "I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

        "selftext": "Nothing I post is financial advice, I have severe brain damage and have the functional intelligence of a particularly smart beetle.\n\nI've heard a lot of talk about people saying \"It's not about the money\" in regards to $GME but I feel that misses the practical mark.  Do any of you ever want to be able to make money on stocks ever again? Because of the possibility of the little guy coming out a little ahead on one stock, Robinhood has trading restrictions on 50 stocks now: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html\n\nThis is absurd, this is manipulation of all sorts of companies that have gone in and out of WSB popularity over the years.  For instance, they don't want you buying $AMD after they just killed it at earnings?  Their PE is only 41, that's nothing compared to the ~180 it was back in June of 2019.  It's a much safer bet now, risk wise.  They're doing this to put us all in our place.\n\nI thought I'd outsmart everyone else here and buy into $NOK before it took off, well now $NOK is restricted too.  And you know what?  I'm never going to make a dime on it if $GME doesn't succeed.  It has occurred to me if I ever want to see a return ever again, I need to buy some $GME at market open monday. And I might never be able to sell.  Because once we start selling, the price will go down fast and the shorts will win.  So the only way to win is to never sell.  If we win, we'll bleed them dry and they'll think twice before trying to screw us again.  The only way to win is to buy $GME and never sell.\n\nTL;DR- Buy and hold $GME until the end of time.",

        "selftext": "Yo \n\nIf you think BB moon\u2019d after this week, you\u2019re a rough brained retard. Our astronauts John Chen and Tom Eacobacci are literally in the break room; Chen\u2019s unpacking some homemade Yangzouh Fried Rice from his wife, Tom is microwaving stale coffee and asking Chen if he\u2019s going to change his name to Cha Ching after he becomes a Billionaire in 2023. Chen smirks as he cracks open his wheel of fortune cookie... the  point is, rocket is still fucking grounded. I repeat, the rocket is grounded. \n\nListen retards, did you miss AMD? Did you miss NVDA? Did you miss trash ass Cringecoin? Hell, did you even miss TSLA? Are you seething with FOMO up to your ears and out of your assholes watching these stocks mint fresh millennial millionaires while you twiddled your thumbs thinking \u201cGeE WiZ tHeY haVe To CoMe DoWn EveNtuAlLYyyyYyyYy\u201d \n\nPro tip: they never came down...\n\nThese rockets went to the fucking moon and left your ass behind on planet Earth, living a shitty wage life flipping burgers, while the retards that boarded these rockets are on the moon laying on beach chairs, sunglasses on, and rubbing sunscreen with SPF 9000 on their smooth brains because they got front row tickets to the sun... FRONT ROW TICKETS TO THE FUCKING, SUN... this is the present state of affairs. \n\nThere is, lucky you, however, another rocket with the inscription BBC fueling up and selling tickets to the moon AS WE SPEAK.\n\nCurrent position: missionary with 10,555 shares and reverse cowgirl with some calls. I\u2019m holding unrealized profits of about $110k and realized profits of about $100k. \n\nHowever, if you ask me 10 years from now my biggest regret in life... I will tell you two things: 1, not getting my wife her bf earlier on, and 2, booking $100k profit too soon in BB. \n\nMay Lord Chen forgive my moment of weakness. Learn from me. Buy and walk away. Buy and hold. Do not be tempted to sell before the moon. To not sell when the rocket is still in the stratosphere. \n\nMoon is $50 IF THE STOCK JUST TRADES ON PAR WITH ITS FUCKING PEERS, MOON CAN EASILY BE $100+ IF YOU FACTOR IN VERTICALS, ECONOMIC MOAT, and a $450-750 billion Auto Data Market as stated in Mckinsey &amp; Company\u2019s report on Monetizing Auto Data. Yes that\u2019s not a mistake, the overall revenue pool from Global Auto Data monetization could be as high as $750 BILLION in 2023. This is the market BB has cornered and is about to squeeze by the balls. QNX was always the crown Jewel of all their verticals. This was always the master plan for the turnaround. We are on the fucking cusp of one of the greatest turnarounds in history. \n\nListen, I don\u2019t think some of you rough brained retards realize what is happening: \n\nAsk yourselves: why is the EV sector so hot? Why is every large tech corporation trying to get a piece of this Auto pie? \n\nYou wanna know why? Because when the computer first came out it took the space of entire fucking floors in a building to do simple calculations... when the cell phone first came out, you needed a fucking brief case just to carry it and looked like an absolute tool making a phone call, stopping everything you\u2019re doing, laying down your suitcase, opening it, taking out the brick, extending a massive antenna, LMFAO, what fucking tools boomers were... anyways, now look at the modern laptop and smartphone. Look at the revolutions these products went through to become cemented into our lives. Look at the markets these products opened up for us. \n\nNow, what current item is undergoing this type of revolution? You guessed it, you smooth brained criminal you, the Automobile. What was once dinosaur machinery unironically running on dead dinosaurs, is now making the revolution on the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today. \n\nAnd guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance? Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today, hint hint: it\u2019s the same company that\u2019s so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround: Revenue Growth. \n\nBlackberry. It\u2019s Blackberry. Babe berry. Member berry. The blacker the berry... the sweeter the juice boys. \n\n\u201cwhAt aBoUT GoOgLe aNd APpLe or TSLA TaKiNg OvEr the Auto OS mArKet\u201d \n\nListen retards, BlackBerry\u2019s MOAT is bullet proof. You know why?\n\nBecause what\u2019s the one thing Google, Apple, and TSLA have in common? They\u2019re actually in the fucking auto business. \n\nYou think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost? Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is? \n\nLet me demonstrate with the ol\u2019 lemonade stand analogy. Let\u2019s say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade. Next thing you know, Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand, and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes. You\u2019re fucked. Jimmy just took your business, your friends, and your girl and her bf. \n\nYou need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade... so how will you do this? Are you gonna go up to Jimmy\u2019s stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy? Is that what a smooth brained person would do? \n\nNO, you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store, buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them, and while you\u2019re at it, buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your fucking lemonade. Because fuck Jimmy, that\u2019s why. \n\nSpeaking of lemonade... \n\n\u201cwHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB?\u201d\n\nAndrew Left although the gayest bear of them all, actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA. He was early on that call, but he was right. \n\nBack to the lemonade moat: \n\nListen retards, Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple, Google, and TSLA are. You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS? Or you think these non techy auto dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS. Fuck no. Don\u2019t be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear \u201cDD\u201d \n\nBlackBerry is a third party corporation that all auto makers can form an auto cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord. A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they\u2019re a fucking tech company to begin with, and they have the scale and reach to do so, but don\u2019t think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them. These other Auto OS (if made) will be specific and unique to that companies own car. Think. Use that smooth brain. \n\nBlackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market. \n\nAlso this is a tough fucking market. Cars are on of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing. This isn\u2019t like a laptop, you click the wrong link, and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups. The car is more serious. You click the wrong link; and you\u2019re dead. \n\nAre you getting the picture now? Do you see why Cylance was bought? Do you see why BlackBerry\u2019s moat is so secure? \n\nNot only does QNX act as the gatekeeper of all auto data, it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows, which it will, exponentially. \n\nAutomakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX.\n\nRemember when Chen said: \u201cwhen better days come, we\u2019ll be ready to execute\u201d\n\nBetter days are here. This is what he was talking about. They\u2019ve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready. The foresight on Papa Chen... Absolute Genius.  \n\n[The Ultimate DD by Mckinsey &amp; Company \u2014 Read This and Get your Pee Pee Hard knowing BB will effectively be the gatekeeper of this New Market](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive%20and%20assembly/our%20insights/monetizing%20car%20data/monetizing-car-data.ashx)",

        "selftext": "**In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of AMD\ud83d\ude80, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their DCF, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term**\n\n**\\~Very Long Post\\~**\n\nHello everyone! Let\u2019s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles &amp; PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.\n\nThe company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.\n\nSo, guys, let\u2019s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.\n\nThe [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing &amp; Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn\u2019t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can\u2019t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.\n\nBoth of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing &amp; graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn\u2019t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation &amp; amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. \n\nThey have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest &amp; tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.\n\nThe company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 &amp; Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nTheir product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel\u2019s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.\ud83d\ude80\n\n[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world\u2019s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.\n\nThey have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings &amp; Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.\n\nAMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9) \ud83d\ude80, which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it\u2019s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.\n\nAMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.\n\nI have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on\u2026\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. \n\nFor the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.\n\nSo, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.\n\nNow there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. \n\nIf we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nFor my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.\n\nI think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage &amp; digital currency mining.\n\nFor their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing &amp; Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.\n\nThis means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest &amp; other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. \n\nI [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.\n\nSo, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.\n\nI like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nI think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE\u2019s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. \n\nSo [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more &amp; more chips that also keep advancing in technology. \n\nThe company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.\n\nSo, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?\n\nLet\u2019s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it\u2019s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years &amp; a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. \n\nAMD hasn\u2019t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it\u2019s a psychological resistance rather.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it\u2019s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.\n\nSo, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nOne last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.\n\nSo, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel\u2019s performance.\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers.\n\nSo far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs.  I'm planning on adding solar and marijuana ETFs.\n\nI've also decided not to sell a single stock no matter what happens, until I have enough to just put everything on VT/VTI and live off of that.\n\nHas anyone else pursued this strategy for the past 4-5 years? If so how did it pan out? When I look at old posts from 2-3 years ago it seems that AMD, MSFT and NVDA were the ones that were hyped up.

        "selftext": "^(This is an opinion based post. Treat it as an entertainment post and not as a factual post. It's all alleged. I'm not a financial advisor and don't take anything in the post as financial advice.)\n\n(Repost due to mistakes)\n\nBy  now as most of us know, Melvin cap has lost 53% on its investments and  that's only what we know(What's hidden to the public is way worse). You  might wonder, why the fuck didn't they exit their position yet? before I  answer the question, I want you to put into perspective the following.  Let's say that $GME was shorted around an average price of 40$(which is a  best case scenario for them) with 140%(if we combine all the players)  and on Friday $GME closed with the price of 325$! Which is an increment  of +700%(of the ideal short position of 40$). It means that as of Friday  they have lost their initial short position 7 times over! Them and  every other big player. So what? They most probably went to a margin  call and that's why they got the bailout money from Citadel. But why  won't they cover you might ask? Why prolong the pain and hold longer??\n\nWell,  Imagine that you had the **Infinity Gauntlet of Wall street** with Billions  of Dollars, political power, and all the media in your palms, but with  all of that you got fucked over 7 times by a collective group of apes  who banded together with accounts averaging around 2000$! Keeping that  in mind, do you think that they will ever fold? Due to them knowing that  we are retards, they think that the $GME play is a house of cards and  with the right play the house will eventually collapse to presqueeze  levels. They will never accept a -700%+ loss and will try every play in  their Ivy league book on us. They used every possible trick in the book  from using the corrupt media, to ddosing Reddit and stocktwits, until  they finally were so desperate and used their Ace of Spades(Robin  Hood)(which took years in the making) in order to exit this shit hole.  Initially, it worked but when it started to fail, they went to full  market manipulation mode(stock restrictions). Freezing Buying didn't  fully work on $GME so they went and fucked every other stock they could.  They won on the side tables by fucking $AMD, $NOK, $BB, $AAL, etc...  and that reloaded their ammunition which is scary for me.\n\nNow  moving forward, I don't think they will ever cover because they will  never accept a loss from an uneducated blue collar class in their eyes.  IMO, they think that they will be able to bend us over after all, but  they still don't understand that we don't have anything to lose. More  over, a lot of the people started with nothing and are willing to go  back to nothing if it means that they got a chance to fight and  potentially defeat the big guy on the battlefield. My biggest fear in  all of this is that even if we win, they will make a liquidity crisis as  their penultimate play. Then the government will have to interfere and  again bailout the big guy, because of course, when the small guy wins  for once, there is a liquidity crisis and his win isn't a win anymore  because small guys never win... But the real win, imo, is the small guy  while being poor, underprivileged, uneducated, and using primitive  weapons(metaphorically), being able to defeat a superpower(hedge funds)  in the battlefield(stock market).",

        "selftext": "This is gonna be a long story about all the unfairness I observed and endured from the 1% both in corporate and the market. I'm sorry if it bores you, I saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during 2008 and I wanted to share my own.\n\n\nSorry for my bad English.\n\n\nHello WSB, I last post around half a year ago on how the US Stock Market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of 150USD a month.\n\nI got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which I immensely appreciated. Now that the GME phenomenon has spreaded over the globe, even here (although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like I went through, more below)\n\n\nSo to recap, I saved up 2000 USD ever since I was young uptil now (I'm 21 now), working ever since I was in elementary school, money was all I had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling.\n\n\nBackstory:\n\n\nI've always loved PC and paid close attention to it so when their new Ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and I got to test them out while working part time, I took a look at their stock. It was trading at around 2 I think.\n\n\nSo with my excitement I was eager to join the market, I asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was \"The market is rigged, don't join it\". I was stumbed. He lost a lot in 2008, maybe that was why.\n\n\nSo after a month of research, it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the US market, or actually to any market aside our own. Our banks wouldn't even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable. But here's the thing, the hedge funds here can. That was the first unfair thing I witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life.\n\n\nIn the end, I couldn't find a way to get in and watched as AMD make it meteoric rise over the past few years. It was really depressing thinking back on how the profit could've helped my family.\n\n\nFast forward to 2020, I finally found a way to make a foreign account with TD and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account, I just need to send him money through epayment. The fees was high, not to mention since we can't use ACH because we're transferring to TD from his account, it cost me somewhere a total of around 50 USD for the money to land in my account.\n\n\nBut after all that I managed to get into the market, I grinded through all the courses on TD and read all the posts from various subs. But life is never that smooth.\n\n\nAround that time, I saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition. That inspired me, I wanted to do that so badly, first for my brother.\n\n\n\nThe Beer Virus Crash:\n\n\nI joined the market at Feb 28th 2020. Yes, right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses. I almost lost it all, I switched between puts and calls as I see fit but in the end, I came out with 200USD left. I thought I was the unluckiest guy on earth. It was tiring, since we're on opposite end of the timezone, I usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am. All that and ending up with huge loss was devastating. Thinking back, I should've pulled out when I was seeing my money losing everyday.\n\n\nThe corona started affecting our country, we did a great job at handling it but I can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs. I put myself back together and get back in with my 200, slowly grinding up back to 2000. It was arduous but when I finally got back to breakeven, it felt amazing. Because I'm not starting again, I'm starting again with experience.\n\n\nSadly, by this time, my father lost his job due to corporate politics/dirty-play. I won't get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others, it's been going on for years. In the end, he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to \"keep the image of the company\". And guess what, he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews. We both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one, they would he put off. To them, it's much better to scapegoat one person than to say \"We let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything\".\n\n\nAfter all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try. It was going well. We don't have advance options and we also don't allow \"legal\" shorting here. But as we'll soon find out, it's only a rule for us commoners..\n\n\nBasically, shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short. I've witness quite a few short ladder attack. \n\n\nAnd since we don't have options, we don't have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but I am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them\n\n\nYou can tell by this point I have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits.\n\n\nGME and the global movement:\n\n\nAnd that brings us to this unprecedented time. I didn't get into GME soon enough (4 GME shares at 150 cost basis) my money was tired up in Spreade for BB and Nok expiring last Friday which was rather deep ITM (I had BB 21/22C and BB hit a peak of 28 last week). And as we all know, by abusing their power yet again, they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless. But I held GME, I held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me.\n\n\nSo now all I have is 4 GME shares that I will hold until we can get back at them and WHEN, not if, we win, hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market - that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this.\n\n\nA lot of people I know are asking to join and I've been helping them setting up accounts on TDA or eToro. Etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck. Since there are no way for us to get Fractional Shares (eToro been wonky), some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of GME on Monday.\n\n\nI look forward to the day we win this, so many things are on the line, not just for our generation, but our previous and future generations, not just for the US stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world. In the end, we might win the battle of GME but still not win much from this war of unfairness but that's a start.\n\n\nSo to conclude this stupid long TEDtalk. You have reinforcement from everywhere WSB. Even from places that cost 2 months wages for a share.\n\n\nLet's make them pay for what they took from us and my brother tuition also! 10k per share is not a meme!!!\n\n\nTLDR: Poor kid from 3rd world country holding GME because suits treated his family badly.\n\nPosition: Every penny in my name - 4 shares of GME\n\nBUY AND HOLD GME!!! - This is not financial advices.",

        "selftext": "Listen up. I just got off a conference call with all your wives' boyfriends and I got some DD to drop on you. Everyone here knows about the big four stocks right now. If not, GTFO.\n\nWhat I\u2019m here to tell is to not focus 100% on these four and let other great opportunities pass you by. (Note \u2013 What I am NOT TELLING YOU is to sell your GME. Hodor that sh\\*t). While you all have been foaming at he mouth over your GME games, you\u2019ve likely missed what is going on with the rest of the market. Several great performing stocks have been dumping since this GME craze began. Oh, need examples?  To name a few you may have heard of: \n\nAAPL \u2013 Down 5.11% \n\nAMD \u2013 Down 7.7% \n\nBIDU \u2013 Down 7%\n\nDOCU \u2013 Down 8.7%\n\nF \u2013 Down 8.6%\n\nPINS \u2013 Down 6.25%\n\nNIO - down 8%\n\nWondering why this may be? Two theories They both might be right, or I might have a really smooth brain. \n\n1) These hedge funds everyone here is so keen on financially ruining need to cover their losses somehow. What better way than to liquidate stocks that have had crazy runs the last few months.  If this is true it will be extra enjoyable to watch them pay more to re-enter these positions when the stocks inevitably bounce back.\n\n2) You people selling your shares in other stuff to buy more GME. (again, great job holding the line) I have seen several posts on here from other smooth brains selling their shares of some of those listed here. I applaud your enthusiasm for the cause and wish you the best. \n\nWith these two combined, you end up with tons of shares dumping from these 401K stocks, with the buyers foaming at the mouth for more GME, NOK, AMC, BB. \n\nOnce this is all over and the world of normies forget all about the GME madness, they are going to put their money back into their boomer stocks and standard 401K stocks. What does this mean for you? Don\u2019t miss the dips happening all around you while the world is focused on 4 stocks and a shiba inu. If you have any extra money and cant afford GME, check out the rest of the market for buying opportunities. \n\nTLDR \u2013 Keep holding the line! If you have any money left, buy the dips on others for bonus tendies\n\n(This is not financial advice)\n\nEdit - added NIO.",

        "selftext": "What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

        "selftext": "This has been posted before, but some people are still asking if they should switch to Webull from Rh, I see people recommending SoFi and TastyTrade too. No! Don\u2019t do it. You need to switch to an established broker that has in-house clearing. \n\nHere is a list of which brokers use which clearing houses. \n\nhttps://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/\n\nIf it says \u201cApex\u201d - stay the hell away. If it says Self clearing: No - stay the hell away. \n\n*I know Rh is now self-clearing, but that literally happened Friday morning and they do not have anywhere close to the required liquidity to handle the current volumes - so stay the hell away.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are GME or AMC gang or if you don\u2019t plan on owning any of the meme stocks. Liquidity issues will effect other stocks too. Robinhood had to limit stocks like AMD, GM and even Starbucks. They can not keep up. Most of those other brokers also use the same clearing house - Apex Clearing. That\u2019s a lot of volume to handle. They will be the weak link in the chain that causes the whole system to fail. They already did on Thursday. All the sketchy  shit pulled by various brokers was a direct result of Apex\u2019s inability to keep up with demand. \n\nTLDR - find your broker on [this list](https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/) and if they say \u201cself clearing -no\u201d then you really should switch to a broker that is self-clearing\n\nThis is is not financial advice, just my opinion.

        "selftext": "\\*This is not financial advice. I'm just sharing random thoughts for entertainment purposes only. \n\n**This upcoming week is the opportunity of a century.**   \n**What you do is up to you, but this is how I see things.** \n\n**First, an overview of what happened last week:**  \n\\-There was an immense wealth transfer of billions of dollars from HF's like Melvin to the retail investor.  \n\\-Citron announced that they will no longer enter massive short positions.    \n\\-Robinhood expands trade restrictions on more stocks, and then retracts them on positions like AMD, AAL and BBBY (no more limits!), and relaxing the share/call restrictions on NOK.  \n\\-Cramer said last Friday that GME holders \"already won,\" that they must take profits, or otherwise risk \"immense pain\".   \n\\-CNBC spent all day talking about how risky GME is at this point for the retail investor.   \n\\-Friday was the lowest day for the market since October 2020.   \n\\-CNBC also bought \"paid promotions\" on Twitter and FB linking news that Melvin closed all their GME positions. \n\nGuys, I've worked in the Hollywood TV Industry as a development executive. I know firsthand how the media manipulates the masses. If it's not damn clear by now, we're being manipulated in a textbook fashion so that we sell our positions in \"the stocks we like\". Why? Maybe because Melvin still has short positions. They're a bunch of smart, manipulative bastards. **Except, the bigs f\\*d up their media manipulation strategy (or couldn't execute properly due to the overall pandemonium), and I foresee even greater losses for them. Here's why:**\n\n**1) Don't Think of Elephants**\n\nQuoting JGL's character in *Inception*, what happens when someone tells you to not think of elephants? You think of elephants. \n\nRobinhood essentially outlined which stocks we need to buy by telling us not to buy them. Also, they actually made each of the \"do-not-buy a lot\" stocks more valuable by lowering the supply without lowering the consumer demand.\n\nActually, how they SHOULD'VE played this was by temporarily adding fees to those specific stocks. This strategy worked for California groceries. Once groceries started charging for plastic bags, people brought their own from home, which stopped excessive use of environmentally hazardous single-use plastic bags. You might think I opened pandora's box on a really good idea. Not really. It's too late. If Robinhood does add fees back, we will migrate to Fidelity, Ameritrade or E\\*Trade, if not now, then later. Robinhood's fee structure and profitability is not our problem. They already tarnished their brand. It's too late to add fees now, because it will be \"on top of\" all the bs they did last week. They needed to choose the \"less bad\" decision and picked the worse one. \n\n**2) Fear, Uncertainty, Destruction (FUD)**\n\nSo, in tandem with the brokerages, CNBC and other mainstream news outlets tried to lower the demand on GME, AMC, NOK, BB, etc. by spreading fear that \"retail investors will be in for some real pain\". Do we believe what they're saying? Nope. Why waste precious airtime for the entire day, discouraging retail investors from buying more of the underlying? Because Melvin and other Hf's still have open short positions. Thursday's GME low was $112. If they couldn't buy to close then, they surely didn't do that on Friday. \n\n**3) Opportunities**\n\na. **Black Friday of the Century**  \nHold your stonks. Hold your leaps. There's gonna be an immense, pent-up demand and a surge in prices for each of the stocks outlined in Robinhood. They gave us a cheat sheet for what stocks to buy and hold for the immense price hike to come. If you already bought GME and the others, this is like owning a PS5 before everyone got them. Hold, because the prices are gonna be insane. \n\nb. **Retail Arbitrage of the Century**  \nIf you didn't already, open up new accounts on E\\*trade or Ameritrade, Buy those \"do not buy a lot of\" stocks you can't get on Robinhood. It will be the price arbitrage of the century once Robinhood is forced to lift restrictions on those stocks. Not gonna say more.\n\nTL;DR - There's obvious manipulation by the brokerages and media. Melvin is not in the clear. We must buy and hold, and take advantage of the immense demand surge that'll happen due to the brokerage's desperate, last minute reactive measure. Media manipulation only hints further that GME and other stonks are far from \"done\".",

The only other company that can compete with TSM is Samsung who are also at max capacity. Meanwhile, Intel's fabs are several years behind.\n\nI know you guys don't like to read so here's the CliffsNotes version:\n\n* AMD growing at rocket speed\ud83d\ude80\n\n* 20% of server market by EOY (Currently at 10%, up from 1% 2 years ago)\n\n* Notebook market share growing by 50% (Lisa just announced this at CES a few days ago)\n\n* Most products are constantly sold out - just look at all the people crying over at r/AMD and all those people that still can't buy PS5's. \n\n* AMD powers both XBOX and PS. PS5 sales topped 3.4 million units in the first 4 weeks. Sony has had to increase production by 50%!\n\n* TSM are trying to build new fabs asap to increase production of CPU's - Today they reported a 23% increase in profits.\n\n* PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade.\n \n* The gaming PC market is set to grow 25% by 2024\n\n* Intel's competitive advantage (their own fabs) is so useless that they are trying to buy space at the already full TSM fab. \n\n* Intel are 2-3 years behind AMD. \n\n* r/intel = 205,452 users, r/amd = 765,440 (hmmmmmm)\n\n* Lisa Su always delivers the promised numbers every quarter \n\nOh yeah, and mad lad **CRAMER** [just told everyone to load up during this buying opportunity.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/intel-shakeup-creates-buying-opportunity-in-amd-jim-cramer-says.html)\n\nRight now the boomers who don't understand the PC market are shorting AMD and buying up Intel just because it's the only name the recognise from the dinosaur age.

        "selftext": "**IN CONGRESS, JANUARY 14, 2021**\n\nWhen, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one group of traders to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, a decent respect to the opinions of Mad Money and other boomers requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. \n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all autists are created *superior*, that they are endowed by Ryan Cohen and u/deepfuckingvalue with certain unalienable rights, that among these are gamma squeezes, yolos, and the pursuit of Tendies. That to secure these rights, subs are instituted amongst autists, deriving their reetard strength from the consent of Papas Musk, Karp, Cohen, and Cathy. That whenever Wall Street institutions and other boomers become destructive to these ends, it is the RIGHT of the reetards to alter or destroy them, and to institute new management of the market. \n\nThe history of the present market makers and whales is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute TYRANNY over WSB and the autistic everywhere. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. \n\n* Market elites have instituted day trading restrictions, harming our abilities to harness rapid moves of the market to our advantage \n* They have infiltrated our sub and kept among us in times of peace, lurkers and FUDders to spread discord \n* They have excited boomers against us, and have endeavored to bring upon reetards the merciless SEC savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all autistic savants, from god-king Musk, to the imprisoned Prince Shkreli\n* They have declared our sacred meme stocks \"casinos\" \n* They have deliberately lowered price targets when they lose the market advantage to harm retail\n* They have limited our abilities to lose our own money, by passing through edict accredited investor limits, putting pressure on Robinhood to halt options approval, and putting a false focus on rIsK mAnAgEmEnT departments\n* They have demonized retail traders for the volatility of the market, ignoring the true culprit of monetary debasement and failure to impose stress tests on the market and its participants\n* They have imposed taxes on us without our consent\n\nIn every stage of these ruthless and evil actions, we have petitioned Cramer and the hotties on MSNBC for redress in the most humble of terms. Our repeated petitions have only been met with repeated restrictions and condescension. \n\nNor have we been wanting in attentions to our Boomer \"brethren.\" We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their \"smart\" and \"learned\" government, brokers, and accountants to manipulate the market in favor of the connected and the whales. They did not listen. We warned them of paradigm shifts in AMD, Tesla, and Gamestop. THEY HAVE BEEN DEAF TO THE *SCREECHING REEEEES* OF AUTISTIC REASON. We must therefore hold them as we hold the whales and market makers, Enemies in trading, in after hours, friends. \n\nWall street can keep their price targets, their analysts, their rules, and their high frequency trading. They can keep their DCFs, their balance sheets, and their provincial focus on rEvEnUe and p/e ratios. Where WSB is going, we have no use for these archaic and backwards millstones, hung around the neck of wage-slave boomers like heavy stones. \n\nWe, therefore, THE UNITED REETARDS AND AUTISTS OF WALL STREET BETS, in general congress, assembled, appealing to the mother of all short squeezes, do, in the name of and by the authority granted by our green dildos, solemnly publish and declare, that these members are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT TRADERS, that we are absolved from all power and control from the big banks, Wall Street analysts, and boomer talking heads. And that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT REETARDS, we have the power to set our own price targets, have the power to levy war on Melvin Capital, establish tendies, and to do all other things the autistic do. \n\nAnd for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of this sub, we mutually pledge OUR LIVES, OUR DD, AND OUR SACRED TENDIES.",

And while it would be more difficult for this kind of trading to spread to large capitalization stocks, there are some that share similar characteristics with those that popped. \n\nHigh short interest is, essentially, a high percentage of total shares available for trading borrowed and sold by bearish investors betting on price declines. It can exacerbate a stock's price rise in a short squeeze because investors like hedge funds, who for the most part are active short sellers, have to buy more shares to cover bets as losses mount. That's what happened when traders targeted GameStop (ticker: GME) and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), whose short interest is far above the average short interest for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&amp;P 500. \n\nGoldman Sachs publishes a report that looks at the holdings of 814 hedge funds with $2.4 trillion of gross equity positions. As of the start of the fourth quarter 2020, the most recent report available, 10 of the stocks Goldman calls \"very important short positions\" for hedge funds with the highest short interest included: C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Aon (AON), Duke Energy (DUK), Analog Devices (ADI), Kroger (KR), Simon Property (SPG), Hormel Foods (HRL), Willis Towers Watson (WLTW) and Chipotle Mexican Grille (CMG).\n\nThose are not small capitalization stocks like GameStop. GameStop is worth more than $24 billion as of Wednesday's closing price, but six months ago it was valued at less than $300 million. The average market cap of Goldman's group is about $44 billion. The least valuable company is Willis Towers Watson with a $26 billion market cap. \n\nThe short interest in these 10 doesn't compare with stocks such as GameStop or Bed Bath and Beyond, either. The average percentage of stock available to trade sold short in the 10 stocks is about 7%. Short interest in Bed Bath and Beyond is about 67%. \n\nLower short interest limits the potential for a big move. But there are rumblings of a squeeze. The average gain in the 10 VISP stocks over the past five trading days is about 1.2%. The S&amp;P 500 is down about 2.6% over the same span. \n\nIf fallout from the GameStop squeeze continues, the impact could spread to those 10 stocks. Kroger and Hormel shares are already up more than others, by 17% and 13%, respectively, over the past five days. That's because losses piling up for hedge funds can cause them to sell long positions. It also means they may have to cover short positions, the trading action that is causing more intense short squeezes like GameStop's. \n\nGains like GameStop are unlikely for those stocks. Still, nothing seems to be off the table these days. \n\nJanuary 28, 2021 09:24 ET (14:24 GMT) Copyright (c) 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. Story ID: 20210128DN009398",

        "selftext": "For those of you who don't know, Bob Swan was the CEO of Intel and he was treated like a leadership God by Boomers even though nearly all of the companies he lead crashed after he left. He was the king of short term short sighted leadership. \n\nHe kept bailing ship right before companies would crash, like GE Financial, HP computers, Northrop, and eBay. But because he bailed on top, Boomers gave him credit for the rise, but not the fall. \n\nBoomers completely ignored how many companies he tanked. \n\nWell, he didnt bail from Intel quickly enough and they tanked 60 BILLION because he failed to develop new products. Instead tried to send jobs overseas and undercut development of new products in order to pump short term earnings, exactly like he did at his previous companies. This let AMD take the lead, and destroyed Intel stock. \n\nIt is incredible that Boomers failed to notice that nearly every company Bob Swan lead crashed right after he left. \n\nGood riddance.",

        "selftext": "Hellow fellow retards. I used to be way more active in /r/wallstreetbets around this time last year, I just wanted to remind you newbies of the saying I saw every where here - FIRST ONE'S FREE.   \n  \nI decided to download Robinhood and take our $1000-2000 tax return and play the market using WSB. I was a 10/10 autist - slowly figuring out what a strike, expiration, call, etc is from context and Google. I was an autist so obviously I installed Robinhood and immediately applied to trade options. I started trading with the hope that we could pay my wife's college debt off - about $28,000. I didn't think it was realistic but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.  \n  \nIt started off rough, I lost about $500. After that, things got great. Within a month of starting I had turned my couple grand into $8,700 with positions (mostly calls) in: AMD, Intel, Square, PLUG, the MEME STONKS of that time.  \n  \nI started to think damn, maybe I COULD make $28,000 to pay off this debt with. Then COVID19 wrecked fucking everything. My account dropped from $8,700 to $2,000 slowly over the next month.  \n  \nSome other retards got on here and convinced everyone of the TRIPLE WITCHING HOUR which would cause SPY or something to fucking BLOW. I remember almost going all in on that play and I was so glad I didn't - because nothing fuckin happened.  \n  \nAfter that I never really had the time to get back into it as my job got really busy due to covid and my wife and I were in the midst of transitioning to the \"vanlife lifestyle\" (its a very cheap/frugal way of life and you experience so much more). I wanted to get back into this with my little bit of buying power left today ($900) but just never made it priority.  \n  \nMORAL OF THE STORY: THE FIRST ONE IS FREE. SOMETIMES ITS BEST TO TAKE YOUR TENDIES, BUT YOU BETTER FUCKING HOLD YOUR GME. Maybe I'll start playing with my $900.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR at the end for the retards who didn't pass third grade \n\nSo most of the news and social media memes about GME boils it down to being the result of an obscure meme ticker being intentionally rallied up by a group of risk-tolerant self-proclaimed retards who all collectively agreed to buy and \"screw the hedge funds\" because we were \"bored at home\" or whatever else. Yeah it's funny and feels good, but it's not the whole story. After all we hype around shit all the time, why didn't CHWY, NIO, TSLA, PLTR, AMD, and SPCE surge 800% in 6 days?\n\n\n#This narrative is dangerous, and lacks important context about Wall Street's manipulation, greed, and how this whole thing ACTUALLY started.\n\n\nIf this narrative is pushed and becomes believed and accepted, then Wall Street and the SEC could actually have a case for accusing retail investors and WSB of market manipulation. But in case you're new that's **not what happened**\n\n\nThis was the complete and sole result of large firms short selling at a gross rate for over a year, while simultaneously working to push down Gamestop's share price through manipulative tactics like ladder attacks and media hit pieces. They could have covered at $4 for huge gains, but it wasn't enough, They were fully intending to run Gamestop into bankruptcy during a pandemic for maximum profit.\n\n\nEventually WSB autists picked up on this and bought the stock **for good reason**, not to collectively just \"fuck the shorts\". Those good reasons include the 148% short interest, GME being undervalued at 4% their revenue, etc etc. You guys know the deal.\n\nThis info was spread through WSB as early as last July by our holy Lord &amp; Savior DVT. Hype over GME went on for months here and eventually it was enough to begin the spike. The spike grew as other firms bought in too and news went viral. And yes, other firms are buying in too. No, your friend on Facebook who just downloaded Robintard to buy 1 share at $310 isn't the biggest one \"holding the line\". Even if 25% of adult Americans owned an average GME position of $300, that *still* leaves institutional investors with ~70% of shares. Yeah we're having a HUGE impact on markets right now but don't be naive and downplay the fund's positions too.\n\nObviously what's happening is incredible, and I'm diamond holding shares &amp; options to the fucking andromeda galaxy\ud83d\ude80\n\nBut please try to correct the narrative where you can, and add the important context. It can make the difference between retail investors getting legal protection or being regulated out of existence.\n\nTL;DR: WSB sparked this but greedy and manipulative Wall Street short sellers were the gunpowder and don't let anyone forget.",

Spurred by zero-commission trading and COVID tailwinds, this booming segment of stock market traders has reshaped market behavior. \n\nI've been scraping discussion on WallStreetBets for several months, and tracking how often different tickers are mentioned every day.\n\nThe graph below visualizes yesterday's discussion on the forum. Size represents the number of times a ticker has been mentioned, whereas color brightness represents the performance of the stock. GameStop Corp.

We ran this backtest using data from 2020.\n\nThe graph below shows the portfolio holdings by week (click for full-size image):\n\n[WSB Portfolio Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/smkp7dualic61.png?width=1119&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95d1d4bbc1047a2c76b26fbfc3305143dc39d6d)\n\nTesla, Apple, AMD, Nio, and Microsoft were among the stocks that most frequently cracked the weekly top five most-mentioned tickers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Most frequently held stocks](https://preview.redd.it/87r1vy9bkic61.png?width=1119&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffe1c8a89f6f603dd000223a4a26ee69402002fa)\n\nOver the last year this simple strategy was up over 61%, with especially strong returns in the last quarter of 2020.

This could indicate a large amount of individual-investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14.41% (3Q20), compared to the industry average.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Palantir Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/4qiik9ekkic61.png?width=1354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=074100895bb7e99da71462126ed7f972d5763948)\n\nPLTR received three downgrades from investment banks between October and December 2020 but added a price target increase to $30.00 (from $18.00) by Jeffries on January 11, 2021, well above its current price of $25.64. Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83% to an $848.1m loss and, as of now, positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend.\n\n**GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)**\n\nGameStop Corp. has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally. Total Liabilities climbed 12.18% to $2.26B from 2Q20 to 3Q20. Before May 5, 2020, WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3.83 counts daily YTD.\n\nShortly following this, several threads on WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million\u00a0shares at the time. WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), Ryan Cohen.\n\nSince May 5, 2020, GME has rallied 755.33% and WSB discussion counts averaged 55.34 a day making a positive correlation coefficient at 0.688.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/g8xj575nkic61.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b458e40d9866fbecbedc224b5679ba885463f5d)\n\nThe WSB counts and stock volume also shared a correlation coefficient of 0.628. This was exemplified on November 30, 2020, when stock volume spiked by 31.3m and discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/3d3xn8dokic61.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af618e9f2ea29d71d69d86dc1884a44ec42bbf24)\n\nThe mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time, which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations, 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing WSB, but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest. Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as WSB are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume. Keeping an eye on rising companies on WSB could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked.",

        "selftext": "I'm in tech and I have good news if you like money. Shorting Intel is too obvious I don't know. why options are so cheap to buy. \n\n**Why Intel is doomed**\n\nIntel have missed their own deadlines for delivering newer manufacturing methods and their CPUs are falling behind AMD in terms of cost and performance for a while. That is not the news. The stock is already hit by AMD performance. Intel is doomed because our industry is moving to Arm. Arm processors are performing way better at a fraction of cost. See [this report](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd/9) if you're not convinced. What I'm seeing in the industry is that a lot of cloud computing customers are finding it super easy to switch to Arm. Developer computers are mostly Macs and the M1 Macs are just the tip of the iceberg on what's going to happen. Once developers can easily develop on Arm machines, they most likely will deploy their code to an Arm cloud server. Amazon's AWS Graviton is performing well enough to switch. \n\n**Microsoft will kill Intel** \n\nApple is doing their part with M1 and Amazon is balls deep with their Arm chips but what makes a huge difference is Microsoft's energy for fucking intel in the ass by making Windows Arm friendly and pulling a fast one on Intel by developing their own chips. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAmazon, Apple and Microsoft are going to gang bang Intel's wife.

        "selftext": "I don't know much, but I know tech and AMD has A LOT going for it right now.\n\n[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\n- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. \n\n- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). \n\n- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. \n\n- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). \n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [\"...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.\"](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)\n\n- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).\n[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)\n\n- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&amp;text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.\n\n - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company\u2019s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&amp;text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware. \n\n - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.) Again, because Google currently relies more on Intel CPUs this is not a big blow to AMD's bottom line. A quick check of BestBuy's inventory shows [47](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Celeron%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i5%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Pentium&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories) Chromebooks with Intel SKUs and only [7 with AMD parts](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A4%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A6%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20Ryzen%203&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories).\n - The chips that Amazon is producing are for their [cloud computing business](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/amazon-apple-chips-intel-arm.html). These were also replaced by Intel.\n\nAMD has earnings coming up on the 26th which I think they're going to shatter. I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 after ER, but I'm not betting on that. Which is why my current position (30% of my portfolio) is LEAPS: (x2) Jan 2022 90c.\n\nMy conservative 6 month PT for AMD is 110. Also open to hearing any other potential risks I may have overlooked. To be on the safe side I'm only including 6 rockets.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Achronix is a fabless semiconductor company that sells FPGA, eFPGA, system level products and supporting design tools. With Xilinx acquired by AMD and Altera acquired by Intel (not really a competitor right now cause everything Intel touches turns into a pile of shit) , Achronix is currently the only independent high end FPGA and the only company providing both FPGA and eFPGA. It is estimated that in the future, we will see more FPGA nodes than CPU nodes. The ratio might be something like 1 CPU to 16 FPGAs as acceleration will outweigh general compute in the CPU. With FPGA being able to be implemented into data acceleration in AI, Cloud, 5G and autonomous driving, Achronix is well positioned and is capable to compete in multiple lucrative sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gdur7umdqc61.png?width=1668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef15151c9d44d31430a0d33bcaab77798c190045\n\nFPGA is a highly valuable business due to its unlimited potential. Intel acquired Altera back in 2015 for $16.7 billion and with the latest acquisition of Xilinx by AMD for $35 billion. Achronix is currently sitting at around $2 bil valuation and is very undervalued given the competitive landscape (we might see an overpriced acquisition of Achronix in the future as both Intel and AMD paid well over the market valuation for both Altera and Xilinx and Achronix being the last one standing could help with the valuation as well). Ever since the acquisition of Altera, Intel has struggled to push for breaking through progress despite having to drop $30 bil on M&amp;As with very little return. The struggle has gone so far that Intel has been ordering chips from Achronix to produce accelerators. With the latest released Speedster 7t chips fabbed by TSMC on the 7nm nodes, Achronix is bringing serious threat to the top end FPGA market as the chip is able to go head to head with Xilinix\u2019s offerings at a considerably cheaper price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s0aqoi8pdqc61.png?width=1677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcceea136ee28b3a7f6eee5c6ae42000e9b5e161\n\nWhile a lot of the revenue comes from selling chips, Achronix also generates revenue from licencing IP. With the Gen 4 eFPGA IP, Achronix was able to increase performance by 60%, reduce power by 50%, shrink die area by 65% while retaining and building upon all of the original functional capabilities which makes it primed to be integrated into data acceleration in AI, Cloud, 5G and autonomous driving by incorporating it into design. eFPGA is said to be the future in many ways because of the advantages that it brings to the table because by adding an eFPGA to an SOC, it can achieve a more flexible design, lower power, higher performance and lower overall system costs compared to standalone FPGA. With Achronix being the only company providing high end eFPGA, the future is definitely looking bright for Achronix.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdnffnrrdqc61.png?width=1803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27ddfd1b4fddcd00ca3b426c3b55ba543314be77\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9kwrpq1vdqc61.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f09787bad7e9431568ea168efced6a782aa21135\n\nSince 2017, Achronix has experienced seven-fold growth and is still expanding rapidly. It received $238 mil orders in 2020 and has $162 mil orders of non-cancellable and non-refundable orders in backlog. It is projected to have a 30% yoy growth, retain a 76% margin and a 32% EBIT margin. Compared to other players in the fabless semiconductor industries, Achronix has the highest projected yoy growth with one of the highest gross margins.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwcacy00eqc61.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=233758ee492c6c1047d7b688d880444a91867608\n\nTo put it in another perspective, outside for the industry, Acrhonix projected growth rivals the growth of a fintech company while having a margin like a SAAS company.  Average growth of a fintech company is projected to be around 25% through 2022 with paypal at around 19%, square at around 40% and sofi at around 30% ( I'm just listing a few here ) On the margin side, Saas companies usually has a gross margin of around 60% to 70% which makes them a really compelling sector to invest in cause once the demand picks up, income will increase significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, Achronix is going to be one hell of a long term play because\n\n1. It's the only company that sells eFPGA\n2. The only independent company that sells high end FPGA  chips\n3. Exposure to bleeding multiple edge high growth and high potential industries with high demand\n4. Potential overvalued acquisition from another company \n5. Growth like a fintech, Gross Margin like a Saas company (Literally can't get better than this)",

        "selftext": "My initial post wasn't showing up on the page because I believe it had too many words. I wanted to write some points toward why GME is going to fly to the moon regardless of the short squeeze. If you're not a gamer then maybe this will provide some insight. \n\nGamestop has been moving away from physical sales in a big way and I believe there are a few things happening in the gaming industry that Ryan Cohen sees as priceless. \n\n**My overall point: Ryan Cohen isn't buying Gamestop to just drive E-Commerce. RC wants to turn Gamestop into the most beloved Gaming Culture company on the planet.** \n\nGaming is a huge industry. As a matter of fact, it's the largest entertainment industry in the world. 180 Billion tendies big and it's growing at such a fast rate it's expected to almost double by 2025. Gamestop is already positioned as one of the most recognizable gaming brands but they are known for not having quality customer service. RC has spoken a lot about how Customer Service and brand loyalty is his primary focus. If he can accomplish this, Gamestop will not have competition in the gaming industry in 5 years. I'm going to make the following points succinct.\n\n1) MSFT and GME have a deal for revenue share. It is reported that Gamestop also has something similar with Sony.\n\n2) Scalpers have ruined new console and PC parts sales for everyone. Inventory shortages are a real problem and Gamestops partnerships are a big part of solving this. here's why: I believe that Gamestop is organizing deals that not only revenue share, but also give them inventory priority. Want to buy the new Xbox? Go to Gamestop. Want to buy the new AMDs? Go to Gamestop.\n\n3) PC Build a Centers - This concept supports my statement in number 2. If Gamestop has a build a PC center arrangement, I would bet my money (and I quite literally have) that Gamestop is arranging inventory priority on the new chipsets and GPUs. It would not surprise me to see GME make deals with Intel and/or AMD to make this happen.\n\n4) Culture - ESports and Streaming are a huge hit. There are 140 Million unique visitors to Twitch on a monthly basis. They have arenas dedicated to ESports that get SOLD OUT. Imagine Gamestop hosting (successfully) local tournaments at their newly refreshed centers. Gamers will recognize Gamestop as an ally to the culture, not just a retailer. \n\n5) Subscriptions - Here's where the MSFT deal is bigger than I think it's being talked about. MSFT did something interesting with their next-gen consoles. They had a deal where you paid 24.99 a month for 2 years for the new console and got a Gamepass subscription included. \n\n6) Gamestop has talked about creating a digital trade-in platform Which would be huge in the gaming industry. I personally own at least 2K worth of digital games I haven't played in years and can't get rid of. \n\nCombine all of my points and I believe RC is looking to partner Gamestop's Power Up Rewards with MSFT Gamepass, along with some form of digital trade-in platform. Subscriptions are profitable.  Gamestop and MSFT partnership is fucking massive. Imagine Gamestop's ECommerce platform being the main medium that Microsoft uses for game purchases and trade-ins. PC game sales through MSFT store, Xbox store, all run on Gamestops platform. They Rev share all digital purchases and trade-ins and MSFT uses Gamestops physical locations to push their PC sales. \n\nSorry for the wall of text but this where my head at. I'm a fucking nerd I get it but Gamestop is known by every single gamer. If they can position themselves as part of the culture and not a blood-sucking retailer, it's game over for the competition. \n\nI believe Ryan Cohen can accomplish this.",

        "selftext": "**GameStop short squeeze is ON! Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD &amp; TSM suffer. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news!**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.\n\nDespite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small &amp; mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.\n\nWe also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn\u2019t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED\u2019s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won\u2019t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD &amp; others, but I think this is more of a \u201chype move\u201d right now. Intel has still fallen behind it\u2019s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&amp;D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.\n\nWe also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled.\n\nWe also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of \u00be of the US population.\n\nAlso, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.\n\nWhile in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7) Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.\n\nWe also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu &amp; Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China\u2019s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.\n\nAnd one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the \u201cbig players\u201d who get in at much lower prices.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.\n\n\ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "# And the breakouts and \ud83d\ude80 of next week:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending (like spotting those \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80).\n\nAs an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not, or to use some automated brokerages like [Quantbase](https://www.getquantbase.com) with algo-investor models based on these sentiment analyses. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.\n\n# Most Hyped Stock Threads\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Title|Tickers|Avg Hype %|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|[GME shorts get crushed as explained by Cramer ... big WSB shout out, the first of two in the show tonight](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxhitu/gme_shorts_get_crushed_as_explained_by_cramer_big/)|GME|300+%|\n|[Tesla passes Facebook to become fifth most valuable U.S. company](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kt4dsy/tesla_passes_facebook_to_become_fifth_most/)|FB, TSLA|300+%|\n|[Citi wants a war?

Ridiculously strong financials at 76&amp;#37; gross margin.](https://preview.redd.it/ful5pypkr6a61.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1512d4d40dceaaa53a38507139f21081cc10a8d3)\n\n[Achronix already has 55 patents and $400M+ in CUMULATIVE ORDERS lined up.](https://preview.redd.it/o8za6bfpr6a61.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e27e7741689a78f0b331b5dde67d06aa8700d78)\n\n[Achronix's management team is filled with experienced veterans in the industry.](https://preview.redd.it/u9ukproxr6a61.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77b6dc618db4f4f9c27a805dcd36741ae659acc1)\n\n[The company is poised to grow at \\~30&amp;#37; CAGR over the next 3 years.](https://preview.redd.it/ox3ms901s6a61.png?width=1278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27d089e63c5c6361f507400d0d6b4eb95aed263d)\n\nFun facts:\n\n* It marks the **first time for a Korean PE firm** to set up a SPAC on the Nasdaq to acquire a US-based company. They don't plan to f\\*\\*\\* this up.\n* Founded in 2004, Achronix is one of the top five global fabless semiconductor companies and the **only independent supplier of high-performance field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)**. The profitable company is a key player in the global FPGA market alongside Intel Corp. and Xilinx.\n* The Silicon Valley-based FPGA maker's revenue in 2018 stood at around 67 billion won ($61.2 million), which surged to 115 billion won in 2020. This year, Achronix is expected to post 173 billion won in revenue. **Achronix will post \\~$160M in revenue for this year.**\n* Achronix's major clients include **Intel, Google, Microsoft and Samsung**. Achronix also licenses its intellectual property to **General Motors** for its advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). What a strong base of clients set-up for this company. Once the merger goes through, Achronix will gain more funding to scale their business.\n* Given its specialty in high volume and high speed data processing, **FPGAs are widely used for data centers, artificial intelligence, machine learning and 5G.** These industries are poised to grow significantly over the next few decades. Despite the buzzwords, they aren't buzzwords without validity. Achronix is positioned to serve these markets well.\n* The FPGA industry grabbed investors\u2019 attention when **Intel acquired programmable chip maker Altera in 2015 for approximately $16.7 billion**, followed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) acquiring the leading FPGA maker Xilinx for $35 billion last year. As of today's writing, ACEV/Achronix's market cap sits at \\~$330M. In my opinion, it is severely undervalued right now.\n\nAlthough the initial rumors and Definitive Agreement came out this week across major publishers, the hype riding clean energy in SPACs overtook this announcement across the markets. **I expect this to be a strong long-term hold over the next decade. Currently, the SPAC trades at \\~15% above NAV.**\n\n[More details surrounding the merger.](https://preview.redd.it/waf6127ks6a61.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48fb1bb2e5098cc9162e805e2071960388f8b6a)\n\nSource:\n\n(1) [https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix\\_Ace\\_Merger\\_Presentation\\_VF.pdf](https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix_Ace_Merger_Presentation_VF.pdf)\n\n(2) [https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us)\n\n(3) [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence)\n\n(4) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace)",

Seeing the explosive growth here recently) is unreal.\n\nThe media coverage is also unreal.  Unfortunately, some are painting the group as a monolithic entity -- a raging, disgraceful mob bent on destruction.\n\nSure - some of the language here is obscene and the culture is undeniably childish.  But let me tell you some of the stuff I've seen:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Multiple stories of members who have used profits to buy Nintendos for children's hospitals, food for health care workers, donations to charities, etc.  This has happened many times before when members made large profits on other positions.  How many hedge fund managers would have done the same had they bankrupted GME?\n\n\\*A doctor (maybe a surgeon?) had a long-standing position on $AMD and made a significant profit.  He posted about it one day and folks were jokingly asking for money  (the typical \"hi, it's me your son....\" approach).  One person mentioned they were a medical student with a huge amount of loans.  The doctor contacted him personally, gave him advice, and helped with $ for loans.\n\n\\*Recently, a gentleman living in his car posted how he had placed $600 on GME call options now worth &gt;$100,000.  The mantra here has been hold, hold, hold with anyone selling facing the potential of a relentless onslaught of insults.  In in this case, countless members encouraged him to cash out at least some of the position to afford housing, food, and warmth.  Countless posts of support and well wishes.  \n\n\\*Likewise, folks posted support and congratulatory messages for someone who was able to secure some profits and buy delayed christmas presents that were unobtainable.  The sheer joy in his post and his newfound ability to bring happiness to others was heartwarming.\n\n\\*Countless posts of support.  While everyone here messes around with everyone else, there is actually a really nice undercurrent where when someone is in real trouble, there is countless outpouring of support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow - with countless bots and new accounts with unclear motives, these types of things are harder to find.  But it is important that this subreddit not be portrayed as a group of $Yahoos or a mob or whatever else the talking heads on financial news networks (with now overtly obvious motives) are saying.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR This autist likes $AMD.\n\nI've held AMD since November 2015 (@$1.94) and have weathered these speculative downturns many times. IMO the latest downturn is driven purely by an anticipated return to greatness due to Gelsinger's return. This confidence in Gelsinger is greatly misplaced for two reasons:\n\n1. Gelsinger may be better than Intels past 3 dipshit ceos, but he's no Andy Grove. Gelsinger's retarded baby was Itanium, which AMD handily beat with x86_64.\n\n2. Even if Intel burried Andy Fucking Grove in a Pet Semetary it would take years for him to turn that steaming turd of a company around. Serioulsy retards, look at AAPL when Steve Jobs returned in July 1997. The stock peaked briefly in 2000 before quickly tanking again. It took the goddam legendary Steve Jobs 5 years to achieve a sustained turn around at AAPL.",

He's got a little capital and wants \"great returns with as little risk as possible\".

ROKU(?), LMND(?), maybeee TSLA (even thou everything the technical analysis shows is that it is currently overvalued). \nThen maybe 30% more risk averse stocks, some boomer stock like AMZN or MT or some E-commerce like ETSY. Maybe some ETF, like the ARK ETF?\nThe last 30% for more high risk stocks, maybe some Cannabis-Stock? Cannabis ETF? Tilray? Aurora? Maybe some cryptos? \n\nHe gives me a year to proove that it is possible to make mad gainz in the stock market and wants to take my mom on a vacation like they've never been before.\n\nWhat do you think of this constellation?

Most of you are probably too new here to remember DryShips (wow what a time), AMD when it was 8 dollars, the Marijuana craze, or the many other notable time periods on here. These past few weeks have been incredible to watch, not in a positive or negative way, truly here to watch the madness.\n\nI hope you all make money whatever the play. Money grows on trees in this economic climate. Go get some, but don't let the ladder fall.\n\nLots of anger here today, blaming institutions, blaming individuals, blaming the lizard overlordz for your losses. Listen, I get it, no one LIKES to lose money.\n\nMarkets have not been rational for a few years... So I ask, where was this anger when Yield Curves inverted and the vix has been through the roof for the last couple years? whats that? your account was green? oh ok then. I say that not to disparage but rather to inform the subreddit as a whole that you guys have blinders on that hide what you do not want to see (confirmation bias).\n\nWhat we DO NOT need is for congress to swoop in and save the day. only thing that type of intervention brings is the common man holding a bag that that causes you to lose sleep. Robinhood was wrong to suspend trading. but it was completely legal. they are a company that has to make money. (If something is free that is not free anywhere else, then it is most definitely NOT free, as you all saw today)\n\nPeople are trading as they drive down the interstate. we have never seen this before on such a massive scale. but remember, the market will always REMIND you of your mortality. it may not be today, or tomorrow or even next week, but the market will humble even the very best.\n\nThis does end the way you want it to end. no one will go to jail. corporations come out on top. remember that. it's a beautiful thing for some but a depressing thought for others. But it is the way humans have operated for millennia. **the smaller tribe always got defeated and beheaded and raped by the larger powerful tribe.**\n\nGOOD LUCK TO ALL, YOU BEAUTIFUL MOTHERFUCKING RETARDS!!!\n\nI hope this doesn't get buried, but it probably will.\n\nfeel free to ask me all the questions you want in comments, I will do my best to respond to them all.\n\nthrowaway account, i can provide proof of other account if you must have it.",

        "selftext": "First off, full disclosure, I'm long AMD and frankly these last two days of AMD getting beat down over Pat Gelsinger, former VMware CEO and now soon to be Intel CEO has got me riled up. \n\nSo, a month ago, activist investors tell Intel they need to shake things up around the office because AMD is absolutely beating them to a pulp. And now here we are, an announcement that current Intel CEO Bob Swan is stepping down and VMware CEO will take over. \n\nAn analyst downgraded AMD over this move. Let me repeat that, an analyst downgraded AMD over Pat fucking Gelsinger. \n\nIn 2012 Pat took over as VMware CEO. Generally,  VMware traded sideways from 2012 to 2016, then saw a 50% drop. That's 4 years under Pat's leadership where there was no growth. 2016-19 were the best years for Pat, if you look at them in isolation. In 2016, VMware experienced a 50% drop in valuation, then rose from $50 to $200 in that time (400%). Pat took over when VMware was trading at $80-90 in 2012, and the stock currently trades at $135, only ~50% growth in 9 years. Over the past 3 years, VMware is actually down. \n\nWhen we compare what Lisa Su has done for AMD to what Pat did for VMware....there is just no comparison here. AMD over the past 3 years has increased 900%. If anything, Pat might make things worse at Intel. \n\nThe analyst logic for the downgrade:  \"missteps by Intel led to a Blue Sky opportunity for AMD.\" You know what?

        "selftext": "\\[I couldn't post yesterday: had to remove a link\\]\n\nAMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I\u2019ve made a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/) about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well.\n\n**Intel struggles**\n\nLast week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)\n\n**AMD Q4 and FY**\n\nEPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.\n\n**2021&amp;2022 Outlook**\n\nBut the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC\u2019s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU\u2019s that can go head to head with NVDA\u2019s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply a P/E off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML\u2019s for example (60). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.\n\n**Booming Market**\n\nFinally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.\n\nPosition:\n\n2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan\u201921 100Calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr; buy AMD \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

        "selftext": "# While there are many more companies that are discussed much more than TSMC (NYSE:TSM) on here, such as Apple, AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, etc, TSMC is a hidden gem that is getting ready to take off over the next few years. Here's why:\n\nTSMC was founded in 1987 with the intent of bringing Taiwan into the global tech market. Morris Chang, who previously worked at Texas Instruments for over 30 years, is the founder and former CEO of TSMC and widely regarded as the \"godfather of computer chips\". TSMC is currently the world's largest semiconductor producer, with over half of semiconductor revenue from TSMC. Other notable competitors include GlobalFoundries (AMD used them for Zen and Zen+, switching to TSMC for Zen 2 and Zen 3), Intel, and Samsung. TSMC is a pioneer in the pure-play foundry business, meaning that they do not produce any chips for their own products. Instead, they manufacture and sell chips to companies, meaning that those who choose to source chips from TSMC do not have to build expensive silicon fabrication plants to manufacture their own chips. TSMC currently operates 10 different silicon fabs, manufacturing over 10,000 different products using over 250 distinct technologies to cater to 499 different customers in 2019.\n\nNot only is TSMC the largest semiconductor foundry, it is also a pioneer in advancing semiconductor production and performance. Currently, TSMC has 7 customers for its new 5nm chips, including Apple, for A14/X chips and ARM-based chips for Mac products, Qualcomm and MediaTek for 5G smartphone chips, AMD, for next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, Bitmain, Intel, and NVIDIA. TSMC is also currently engineering its N4 chips, built on a 4nm process node, its 3nm chips, and its 2nm chips, which will use new GAAFET (Gate All Around Field Effect Transistor) technology instead of the traditional FinFET technology.\n\n**So who are some of TSMC's biggest and most notable customers?**\n\n# Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nApple is the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization (2.17 Trillion), and has become widely popular due to its heavy and cohesive integration between its products and widespread use by many prominent figures. Currently, it offers many products such as laptops, phones, smart watches, smart TV products, fitness products, and more. It also offers many services and software products, which all integrate with each other via iCloud, continuity software such as Handoff, and more. Recently, Apple has confirmed that they are cutting support for Intel CPUs on their Mac products in a few years, meaning they will shift to using entirely Apple Silicon chips for all of their Mac products. This is in addition to Apple using their own chips for all other products that they currently produce - iPhones, iPads, smart watches, etc.\n\nApple is one of TSMC's largest customers, and that is only expected to grow as they ramp up production for their M1 and next generation ARM chips for Macs. Apple's M1 chips are a strong competitor to AMD and Intel CPUs, especially if they can scale well up to 32 and 64 cores. They are extremely efficient and consume drastically less power than x86-based CPUs (Intel and AMD CPUs), meaning that thermal requirements are much lower. Macs have typically been targeted by PC enthusiasts as an overpriced, underperforming lineup, but we may see that change as Apple's new chips perform extremely well.\n\nApple reported a yearly revenue of 274.5 billion US Dollars in 2020, roughly a 5% increase from 2019. Since Apple relies on TSMC for their chips, and Apple's Mac lineup is likely to become more popular, I would expect that TSMC's revenue from Apple will increase more than we've seen in previous years.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAMD has certainly made a huge return since Lisa Su became CEO in 2014 and the production of Ryzen, which was widely popular due to its high core counts and high price to performance compared to Intel. Now, Ryzen has developed into a strong all-around player, sporting high core counts and great single thread performance. Currently, AMD Ryzen 5000 desktop CPUs outperform Intel's current generation Comet Lake CPUs in games, which is the first time that AMD has surpassed Intel in gaming performance.\n\nAMD has slowly been regaining market share, both in the PC enthusiast side and the server side. In the past two years, AMD has doubled their server market share from 4.5% to 8%. This may not seem like much, but considering that server upgrades are not frequent and those who buy Intel server CPUs are more likely to stick with Intel, that is a massive increase. On the PC enthusiast side, AMD CPUs have accounted for 84% of CPUs sold on mindfactory.de, a German PC Retailer. This is a massive increase considering that in 2016, before the release of Ryzen, Intel accounted for roughly 75% of CPU sales on mindfactory.de.\n\nAMD launched their Zen 3 chips in 2020, which was followed by huge demand and a shortage of these CPUs. This was in part due to demand at TSMC not being able to keep up with AMD's orders. Zen 3 CPUs perform extremely well, and next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, which will be on TSMC's 5nm process, point to a shortage of fab space at TSMC.\n\n# Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nQualcomm is a semiconductor company that creates wireless technology chips, CPUs, software, and services related to wireless technology. Their most prominent products include their Snapdragon CPUs, used in phones from some of the largest smartphone companies such as Samsung, LG, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. They also produce application specific processors for things like cameras, IoT devices, kiosks, robots, and a lot more. Additionally, Qualcomm offers desktop CPUs, such as their Snapdragon 8cx. Qualcomm also produces various connectivity chips for things such as WiFi (onboard chips in laptops, desktop Wifi cards, routers, modems, etc), Bluetooth, and internet connectivity chips on smartphones.\n\nCurrently, Qualcomm relies on TSMC for the production of its Snapdragon chips. Although Samsung beat out TSMC for the production of Qualcomm's upcoming 5G chips, mobile chips accounted for 44.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue in 2020, while RF Front End chips (smartphone internet connectivity chips) accounted for just 9.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue.\n\n# NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA has been a long time customer of TSMC, dating all the way back to 1998 when NVIDIA switched over to TSMC's 350nm process for the Riva TNT. Since then, TSMC has manufactured nearly every NVIDIA chip up until RTX 3000 series, also known as Ampere. NVIDIA decided to switch to Samsung's 8N 8nm process node, likely due to financial reasons or fab capacity reasons.\n\nHowever, NVIDIA is allegedly moving back to TSMC to manufacture more Ampere GPUs using their 7nm process. There could be a few reasons for this - TSMC might have offered NVIDIA a deal, or capacity for 7nm fabs may have opened up due to large customers such as Apple and AMD shifting more focus towards TSMC's 5nm process.\n\nNVIDIA's RTX 3000 series GPUs, also known as Ampere, are a massive improvement in the GPU space compared to previous generations and just for performance in general. The RTX 3070 performs similarly to an RTX 2080ti, where the former has an MSRP of 499 USD and the latter has an MSRP of 999 USD. In addition to much greater price/performance, Ampere GPUs also heavily increase ray tracing performance so games that can take advantage of ray tracing hardware are actually playable. They are extremely popular, and currently Ampere GPUs are selling anywhere from 200 to upwards of 1500 dollars of their MSRP. NVIDIA is also huge in the AI/Computing space, teaming up with NIO for AI-based self-driving computation, Photoshop, for neural filters, and also  powers some of the fastest supercomputers in the world. In regards to AMD, NVIDIA blows the new RX 6000 series GPUs out of the water for things like streaming performance and workstation performance.\n\n# Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nWhile Intel has traditionally manufactured most of their products (Internet connectivity products, processors, chipsets, etc), Intel is reportedly shifting a fair amount of their chips to TSMC. Recently, Intel announced they would use TSMC for 7nm Xe graphics chips on their CPUs. In October of 2020, Intel CEO Bob Swan said Intel would decide by January whether it was going to expand its 7nm production, outsource it to a foundry, or both. Intel has severely underperformed in the CPU space compared to AMD, but if they decide to shift some production to TSMC, this could mean that Intel will make a strong return into the CPU space and strong entry into the GPU space.\n\n# Cool, but what does this mean?\n\nAgain, TSMC is the largest foundry, outclassing the likes of Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and other similar companies. There is an insane amount of demand for TSMC's chips, and they are extremely competitive compared to other manufacturers. TSMC has customers such as Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm, which all have great products and are only expected to grow with the release of new technology such as CPUs or 5G networking. Many of its customers are expected to have massive growth over the coming years, meaning that TSMC will reap some of those profits.\n\n# Ok, but why should I buy now?\n\nI mean, TSMC is already up over 100% over the past year, isn't it too late to buy in?\n\nWhen you consider its most important clients, all of them are going to use TSMC for future products that are important to their respective segments. Apple has just begun their venture into producing their own CPUs for Mac products, the release of DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 is right around the corner with AMD's Zen 4 processors, set to release late 2021 or 2022, Qualcomm producing next generation Snapdragon CPUs (and we may see 5G production shifted to TSMC), Intel actually producing competitive CPUs once again (which might be with TSMC), and NVIDIA continuing to dominate in the computing space and the GPU space. Considering that all of these things are happening in the next few years, TSMC is getting ready to take off.\n\nPositions: Currently holding 4/21 calls, will definitely roll calls and load up on more once we get closer to expiry",

        "selftext": "In early Q1 P-C-P-L is merging with E2open. E2open has disruptive AI / Cloud technology for the supply-chain industry. They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.\n\nWhat differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.\n\nE2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.\n\nE2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.\n\nIn the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. \n\nI'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.\n\nEven if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.\n\nInstitutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers. \n\nMy PT pre-merge is 15 and 25 EOY assuming their projected 10% revenue growth. If E2open surpasses 2021 expected revenue as I'm suspecting and they have major quarterly beats, I'm holding until 50.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my largest position. I'm in 2500 shares at 10.87.",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

        "selftext": "# The Metric\n\nI recently had an idea for a metric to be used to find hot stocks. I call the metric \"Price Elasticity\" and it is comprised of two numbers: upturn elasticity and downturn elasticity.\n\n* Upturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market up days\n* Downturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market down days\n\nUsing these numbers and a few additional basic requirements (like positive EPS and at least 31 days of trading history), my screener found 99 stocks out of about 5700 searched that have good to exceptional price elasticities. (the list of these stocks is linked below and also [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing))\n\n# What makes for good price elasticity numbers?\n\nI made two classifications for stocks with good price elasticity data.\n\n1. **Irrational** \\- Upturn elasticity &gt; 1, Downturn elasticity &lt; 0\n2. **Responsible** \\- Upturn elasticity &gt; 1, 0 &lt; Downturn elasticity &lt; 1\n\nWith any stock I want an upturn elasticity &gt; 1, meaning that the stock tends to move higher than the market when the market goes up. The \"Irrational\" classification gets its name because if a stock's downturn elasticity is negative this means the stock, on average, moves up when the market goes down. So a stock that moves higher than the market when the market goes up and also moves up when the market goes down is classified as \"Irrational\". These stocks tend to have less trading history and are very volatile.\n\nThen there are \"Responsible\" stocks which like Irrational stocks move higher than the market when the market goes up. Unlike Irrational stocks though, Responsible stocks move lower when the market moves lower. The reason I still consider them good is because their downturn elasticity is &lt;1 and &gt;0, meaning that, while they do move down with the market, they move down to a lesser degree.\n\nSome popular stocks picked up by the screener include: AMD, ADSK, ETSY, NFLX, NVDA, SHOP and TSLA. Many of the other stocks have lower market caps and could be interesting value / growth plays given they too made the cut.\n\n# Link to the 99 stocks found:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea if there is merit to my Price Elasticity metric (or if it has already been \"invented\") but it was a fun project and the screener found some interesting stocks I would have never discovered otherwise. The validity of the metric is entirely based on the assumption that past trends indicate future performance, and for those looking to beat the market the trends of these 99 stocks should be very appealing. I made the screener using Python3 and TD Ameritrade's API. Of the stocks in that list I am currently holding AMD, CAMT, EPAM, and NLOK.",

        "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI have been lurking on here for quite some time now and, going into 2021, I figured I'd start a thread to ask some of my questions for 2021. Maybe I will see them answered, or read suggestions / find inspiration.\n\nI started investing about three months ago and am currently invested in Vanguard All World, SAP (buying after the dip has worked out well), ICLN, Nvidia, AMD. I intend to hold all of them long-term with a hopeful profit of over 5%. Nvidia has a bit more room to grow, I hope, given their sales numbers, different tech and ARM acqusition, and I am also hoping for incredible sales numbers of AMD. \n\n I also hold GME because I am an absolute sheep idiot who bought into the hype high; I will probably sell low but am waiting for Jan 11. In the next few days, I want to buy a bit of Microsoft for 2021. Overall, I am looking for a relatively \"safe\" return of at least 5 - 10%, ideally a bit more of course. All my stock choices, however, are very tech-oriented. That is because it's the field in which I know most about the companies and their numbers, and also because they've been running well.\n\nHowever, I am very new and none of this of course means that these companies will run well in 2021. If we start seeing a return to normalcy in mid 2021, what are stocks that really benefit from that return to \"normalcy\"? I figured Salesforce could be an option because of its dip and them also probably benefiting from overall economic upturn, just like SAP. But that, again, would be tech. I read JPM and on this subreddit a lot, what would be the reasoning here? People are also mentioning Disney: is that because of Disney+ or because of reopening theme parks? \n\nSo, as you can see, I am open for suggestions. It'd be cool if you could help me out a bit! Thank you in advance. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot invest in ARK ETFs, as none of my three European brokers offer these funds, and I am not willing to open a fourth broker account.",

        "selftext": "[SPX Monthly Chart:](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/7rPzyt3E-SPX-Monthly-Risk-Reward-Less-Favorable/)\n\n* The market basically closed the year at ATH (3pts off) and is within a hair of 3855, which is the 138.2% Fib of the March low.\n* The rising monthly channel (shown above) shows that markets are stretched near resistance and already outside of their bollinger bands. The weekly band is at 3774.\n* While I believe there is room for upside into 2021, the risk/reward is **NOT** favorable here anymore. Sentiment is stretched and a correction would be welcomed with open arms.\n* I anticipate a 10-15% correction to start the year, which would align us with the rising 200dma near 3219. We ended the year in a tight range, and there is potential to carry into 3855 based on January 15 open interest and gamma positioning.\n\nLast few days I have been selling stocks and calls aggressively in anticipation of a correction. I am long TLT calls (flat) and SPY puts (down 37%).\n\n**Sentiment:**\n\n* The AAII Sentiment Survey is quite elevated near multi-year highs and shows overly bullish sentiment.\n* The Advisors Sentiment Report reports the views of over 120 independent investment newsletters (those not affiliated with brokerage houses or mutual funds) and reports the findings as the percentage of advisors that are bullish, those bearish and those that expect a correction. The current Bull to Bear spread is one of the highest in decades, yet another indication of frothy sentiment.\n* The NAAIM Exposure Index is currently at 89 and off some 100+ prints but remains elevated to the averages.\n* The BAML Fund Manager Survey shows the three most crowded trades are:  \n\n   * Long Tech via shares\n   * Short USD\n   * Long Bitcoin Spot via Perpetual Swaps\n   * Fund managers are \"all-in\" on leverage. This is evidenced by our DIX print on Thursday yet again showing dark pool buying.\n* Consumer Confidence deteriorated sharply in December, as the resurgence of COVID-19 \"remains a drag on confidence.\u201d\n* CEO Confidence, as tracked by the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index hit a two week low at 47. This is the sharpest drop in economic outlook since April.\n\n**Market Health:**\n\n* NYSE Cumulative Adv/Dec:  \n\n   * Actually pretty healthy right now. This is still well above all of its important moving averages and remains in an uptrend.\n* NYSE McClellan Oscillator:  \n\n   * Neutral currently.\n* NYSE Summation Index (NYSI):  \n\n   * Most commonly used by fund managers to find divergences. Above a short term 5/8 day exponential moving average is a buy signal. Below flashes a short term sell signal. This is *currently showing a sell signal.* However, sell signals in rallies tend to be early signals...\n* Moving Averages:  \n\n   * The 8/21-week EMA crossover has long been a favorite signal for momentum in individual names and also works with Indices. The 21-week EMA is important support for growth/momentum stocks. In general, you want to be long when the 8 week is above the 21 week and short when it is below with crossovers being key trend inflection signals. The 12-month moving average (MA) and monthly MACD are good longer-term risk management tools. The price action relative to the 200-week MA provides a good gauge for the health of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s secular trend. Pullbacks or corrections (aka cyclical bear markets) for the S&amp;P 500 that hold above or near the rising 200-week MA are a secular bull market pattern. Pullbacks that decisively break the 200-week MA are a sign of a secular bear market. Most corrections on the S&amp;P 500 during the 1950-1966 and 1980-2000 secular bull market held between the 100-week MA and the 200-week MA. The 2015-2016 S&amp;P 500 pullback fit this secular bull market correction pattern. The secular bear market periods from 1929-1950, 1966-1980, and 2000-2013 saw sustained periods below these long-term moving averages. This means that the 200-week MA provides a good secular bull market risk management tool or stop loss. Using this history as a guide suggests that the Ichimoku monthly cloud is a good trailing secular bull market stop loss. History also suggests that a decisive move below the monthly cloud confirms a secular bear market for US equities. *Currently we are above all moving averages and this is a bullish signal.*\n\n**Economics:**\n\n* The common theme appears to be an expectation of a synchronized global growth in 2021.\n* The optimism on 2021 delivering a record year for corporate profit growth and strong GDP growth around the globe is very contingent on a successful vaccine rollout. The current surge of cases and hospitalizations in the US and Europe is resulting in further restrictions and lockdowns that will weigh on growth expectations, or at least push out pent-up demand. Consumers have led the recovery so far with a boost from fiscal stimulus but the key to a self-sustained recovery is a strong capex cycle which is seen kicking off in Q2 2021. The labor market will also be in focus after record low unemployment the pandemic saw the number jump to 14.7% in April, the highest since the Great Depression, but has recovered rapidly though losing some momentum as it finished the year near 6.5% unemployment and consensus expectations to reach 5% by the end of 2021, still far-off from the 3.5% pre-crisis rate.\n* The recovery has already started in 2H20 in the US &amp; China while the European recovery has been more subdued. The driver of the strong 2021 recovery will be the full reopening of economies worldwide which makes a successful vaccine distribution critical. The US Dollar is closing 2020 weak and looks to have some structural issues with surging deficits, Fed\u2019s intention to boost inflation, easy financial conditions, and expected economic and political improvements. The combination of easy monetary policy, a rebound in old economy industries and a global upswing in growth provides a healthy backdrop for 2021. The balance sheets of households, corporate and governments are expanding alongside the aggressive monetary policy and signs of inflation returning causing a rotation back to value and cyclical growth supported by a steepening yield curve.\n* GDP is seeing rising 6.4% globally in 2021 according to Morgan Stanley, the consensus is for 5.4% growth. In the US those numbers are 5.9% and 3.8% respectively.\n* Inflation would be the key risk into 2021 with it likely to start showing up in 2H21, and the risk being an overshoot could start a disruptive shift in Fed policy. Surging debt remains another concern, as a share of U.S. GDP, total debt has spiked near a record high and total nonfinancial debt has surged to new all-time highs. The rapid increase in government deficits is due to the combination of 1) the budget shortfall that already existed and was growing, plus 2) the deficit spending to fund the stimulus programs to date.\n* The other clear risk in 2021 is China where debt defaults are rising and could spark a move to credit tightening and a recession that would strangle the global recovery. The overall default rate is currently low but the percentage spike in debt/GDP was the highest since 2009 which could lead to policy tightening in 2021.\n\n**Market Valuation and Fundamentals:**\n\n* The NASDAQ continue to outperform in 2020 with a 45%+ YTD return compared to the S&amp;P at +15% as major secular trends in technology continue to play out. The trend of rapid rotational moves also continue with growth often seeing selling pressure for a few days before quickly recovering and resuming the longer-term uptrends. Into 2021 earnings growth is expected to be a record though room for multiple expansion is minimal. A combination of improving economic conditions causing greater business and consumer confidence should drive strong earnings growth in 2021. Increased fiscal spending and a moderation of tariffs provide additional tailwinds. In 2020 many businesses shedded labor and transformed business models to higher productivity to offset the collapse in demand and low inventories with rebounding production point to margin expansion in 2021. The 2021 environment shapes up to be one of solid earnings growth, a return of buybacks and modest multiple contraction. The growth versus value debate is likely to continue but the low-rate environment continues to favor growth, but even more-so a greater preference for quality, companies with strong balance sheets, cash flow generation, and returns on capital should continue to outperform. We are seeing historically strong earnings revision ratios and a record percentage of stocks with dividend yields above the rate of the ten-year Treasury, both conducive to allocations to equities. Compared to bonds, equities can act as a hedge in case of inflation and, with a thorough selection process, can still offer returns closer to historical returns.\n* My forecasts for 2021 take into account consensus expectations, a bull case for a strong vaccine rollout, and a bear case for disruptions to the vaccine rollout and geopolicatical potential issues. I am assigning a 40% probability for the bull case, 40% for the base case, and 20% for the bear case to arrive at a S&amp;P fair value of 3600 though 1H21. In 2H21 we start to look to 2022 estimates and feel we can approach $200 EPS with slight multiple contraction to 22X leaving upside potential to 4400 for year-end 2021.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU](https://imgur.com/a/QqPjfbU)\n\n* For 2021, the bottom-up EPS estimate (which reflects an aggregation of the median EPS estimates for CY 2021 for all of the companies in the index) is $169.20. For CY 2021, analysts are projecting earnings growth of 21.7% and revenue growth of 7.7%. The 6% trend growth rate since the 1930s would point to S&amp;P 500 EPS getting back to trend levels of $187 in 2022. An optimistic vaccine scenario would see S&amp;P 2022 EPS well above $200.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3](https://imgur.com/a/lLhmsb3)\n\n* The low rate environment impacts the multiple, and assuming the 10-year stays low, the Fed keeps rates at zero, and credit spreads stay firm, a valuation framework would put a trailing PE at 24X and forward at 21.5X for the current environment. The spread between the S&amp;P dividend yield versus the corporate Baa bond yield is near historical highs and the ERP (Equity Risk Premium) is very high by many measures. Assuming the spread between the dividend yield and IG corporate yield goes back to 2012-19 levels, it would point to 30%- plus upside for S&amp;P 500 valuations. Assuming some rise in rates as the spread narrows more from falling equity yields would point to 20%-plus upside. In 2021, policy support should remain in place to curtail risk aversion. Besides the risk of a credit crisis, concerns over a late-cycle overheating have been pushed further out due to the pandemic-induced recession and policy makers\u2019 increased inflation tolerance. When comparing relative attractiveness across asset classes, which ultimately steers a substantial part of investment flows, equity markets continue to look quite attractive. Since the beginning of 2020, real bond yields in the USA have declined by over 100 basis points, outpacing the decline in earnings yields (inverse of the price-earnings ratio), thus supporting higher valuation multiples. Currently the difference between the earnings yield and the real bond yield as a measure for the equity risk premium (ERP) is higher than the long-term average, suggesting that equities offer an attractive excess return over bonds. Although lower interest rates support higher multiples due to the increase value of future earnings, a return to normal could push long-term interest rates higher and exert downward pressure on equity valuation multiples.\n\n[Sector Growth Rates](https://imgur.com/a/IJPIPWW)\n\n**Analyst 2021 Predictions:**\n\n* Morgan Stanley: $3900 - After a year of big swings in valuations, 2021 will be about who can deliver on earnings. 2020 was all about beta and understanding how equity markets trade in and around a recession that handed us the fattest pitch we\u2019ve seen in a decade. 2021 will be much more about stock picking (alpha) and should favor those companies that can deliver earnings growth that isn\u2019t already expected or priced. MSCO prefers companies with earnings growth most tied to re-openings and an economic recovery and also favors small caps. Financials are also preferred due to positive upside skew on rising rates and better credit; Materials and Industrials on demand rebound, earnings leverage and inflation protection; and Health Care given its GARP characteristics and re-rating potential with fading political overhangs.\n* Bank of America: $3800 - Stocks have already priced in much of the expected recovery in the economy and corporate profitability, leaving just slightly more upside heading into next year. Even as investors ride a wave of vaccine-related optimism, potential negative catalysts abound. The recovery is intact and the world likely reopens in the 2H, but a lot of optimism is priced in already on vaccine/recovery. Vaccine execution risk, delayed fiscal stimulus and longer lockdowns are risks. But a few themes support stocks: the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield is 3x the 10-year yield, and S&amp;P 500 dividends are set to increase in 2021. And unlike bond yields, earnings are nominal and participate in inflationary upside \u2013 where inflation risks may be running higher, given rampant money-printing and a potential post-vaccine spike in demand. BAML picks value stocks over growth, cyclicals over defensives and small caps over large caps, given each of these groups\u2019 likelihoods to be disproportionately boosted by a post-virus economic recovery.\n* Goldman Sachs: $4300 - A vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. The economic reopening coming alongside a vaccine, in tandem with a status quo policy environment cemented with a divided government, will help push the S&amp;P 500 to 4,300 by year-end 2021 and then to 4,600 by the end of 2022. The forecast assumes that the Senate will remain under Republican control following the Georgia run-off elections in January, the economy will continue on a path toward a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery, corporate profits will rebound, Fed funds rate will hold near-zero and the yield curve will steepen while the 10-year Treasury yield climbs only modestly.\n* Deutsche Bank: $3950 - Much of 2020\u2019s run-up in the stock market came with multiples expansion, as prices escalated despite a drop in earnings, as companies dealt with fallout due to the coronavirus pandemic. Next year, as the economy recovers and a vaccine allows for long-lasting re-openings, earnings growth will rebound and multiples will de-rate. The pattern of the equity market recovery, bottoming halfway through recession and recouping most of its losses before it\u2019s over, has been typical but the continued run-up means valuations are high. In our reading, elevated multiples reflect increased participation of retail investors which we see as sustaining, but we expect the multiple to begin to de-rate. For 2021, a recovery in earnings \u2014 which essentially increases the denominator of the price-earnings ratio \u2014 should lower multiples. That said, an increase in companies\u2019 payout ratios as dividends and buybacks return could at least partially offset this. A gradual correction of overvaluation argues for the current overvaluation of 5 multiple points to diminish but remain significant at 3.6 points, putting the end-2021 multiple at 20.5X.\n* Jefferies: $4200 - Improving prospects for a vaccine, easy lending conditions and broader participation among cyclical and value stocks will help propel the stock market higher in 2021. November\u2019s historic stock market rally, led by cyclical and value stocks in the energy, financials and industrials sectors, reflected broadening equity strength beyond just big tech and software shares. That rotation is anticipated to continue into next year, helping push the broader market higher. Notwithstanding the second and third Covid-19 waves permeating the world, there is a palpable feeling that the global economy is resynchronizing with the household, corporate and government balance sheets expanding simultaneously alongside aggressive monetary policy. The much-maligned value and cyclical growth sectors are slowly making a comeback as inflation pressures begin to return. This rotation has been supported by a steepening in the yield curve and with growthier stocks trading sideways. Improved visibility towards a successful coronavirus vaccine, easier lending conditions, little evidence of deflation and a sentiment switch from growth to value will lift US bank shares through 2021. Rising global capacity utilization rates, firmer producer prices, improving world trade volume, booming housing/autos and a weak dollar are the perfect environment for the S&amp;P 500 Industrials. The S&amp;P 500 materials sector is blowing off in response to a weak dollar, higher commodity prices, an upswing in global manufacturing and a restocking cycle.\n* CSFB: $4050 - Our 2021 forecasts are designed to answer a simple question: what the future will (2022) look like in the future (end of 2021). From this perspective, we are forced to de-emphasize the near-term, focusing instead on the return to a more normal world. As we look toward 2022, the virus will be a fading memory, the economy robust, but decelerating, the yield curve steeper and volatility lower, and the rotation into cyclicals largely behind us. Since the stock market discounts future events, each of these prospects for further improvement down the line should translate into a higher S&amp;P 500 as investors price in these events.\n* UBS: $4100 - The vaccine-related developments that drove stocks\u2019 gains in November and early December have now been baked into market expectations, leaving vaccine distribution the next milestone for equity investors to consider in 2021. The key driver of U.S. equities will be the pace of vaccinations, similar to how shifts in mobility drove equities through the spring and summer. As people get vaccinated, they are likely to \u2018normalize\u2019 spending on areas impacted by COVID shortly thereafter. We see the rotation toward cyclical services spending and other COVID-hit areas as a key investment theme for 2021. UBS is overweight the consumer discretionary, industrials and energy sectors given that consumption and production will likely rebound next year. It downgraded materials and financials to Neutral. It is also Underweight consumer staples, utilities and REITs and Neutral on information technology, but overweight communication services and health care on still attractive growth relative to valuations. UBS maintained an upside case for the S&amp;P 500 of 4,400, which would emerge in the case of higher-than-baseline growth against a backdrop of still-low interest rates. However, in a downside case, the S&amp;P 500 could fall to 3,300, which would entail a weaker recovery and/or tighter financial conditions.\n* BMO Capital: $4200 - Heading into 2021, stocks are poised to keep reaping the benefits of the massive infusion of monetary support from the Federal Reserve, along with an anticipated additional round of fiscal stimulus. This constructive policy environment is likely to help push equities higher even as virus concerns linger for at least the first several months of the new year. Even with recent positive vaccine and treatment developments, the global pandemic and its unprecedented impact is unlikely to fade in coming months. As such, the massive fiscal and monetary response in the U.S. and around the world (also unprecedented) will likely remain in place to combat its negative economic impact for the foreseeable future. Such environments have historically supported continued stock market gains and we see no reason why 2021 will be any different. Aside from the global financial crisis, 2020 represented the swiftest quarter-over-quarter earnings collapse for the S&amp;P 500 where index EPS plummeted nearly 50% during 1Q, thus, we anticipate that 2021 has the potential to be one of the best years ever in terms of earnings growth, something we believe will also help to push stock prices higher. We remain optimistic and expect another year of double-digit gains as the economy and society slowly transition back to normal.\n* Barclays: $4000 - Markets are right to be optimistic about the global economic outlook in 2021, with growth returning and inflation rising but staying below central bank targets. Projected global gross domestic product growth of 5.6% in 2021, rebounding from a 3.6% contraction this year, with most Western economies reaching so-called herd immunity from Covid-19 in the second and third quarters of the year. Forecasts reflected the recent slew of positive vaccine results with efficacy rates exceeding expectations, which point to a significant boost for growth in the second quarter of 2021. Barclays also suggested the inflation outlook would not indicate any unwinding of current unprecedented levels of central bank support. Labor markets are recovering, but we are still at very high unemployment, so there is undeniably a lot of slack in the system. That means that when it comes to core inflation and the underlying drivers, to wage costs etc., that was unlikely to happen in the short run, meaning even next year. It would take several years really to come back. While Barclays anticipates a gradual improvement in inflation, it will not be significant enough to cause central banks to consider tightening their accommodative monetary policy stances. We have an environment whereby growth comes back, inflation stays relatively muted, and you have central banks continuing to support the recovery, and tightening is still far out.\n* Oppenheimer: $4300 - The S&amp;P 500 is likely to post another double-digit percentage gain in 2021 as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines underpins a lasting economic recovery. This outcome is based on six key assumptions: First, that the public will expediently accept and receive COVID-19 vaccines and second, that equity investors will discount the success of the vaccines in reversing the disruptions brought on by the pandemic. Thirdly assumes that at least one of the two Senate seats in the Georgia runoff election will go to a Republican lawmaker, thereby retaining their control of the Senate and reducing (if not necessarily eliminating) the risk that the Biden administration will eradicate the corporate tax reform act of 2017. Fourth, the Federal Reserve will continue its low interest rate regime in tandem with accommodative monetary policy, and fifthly, that congressional lawmakers will step in with another round of fiscal stimulus by the first quarter of 2021 at the latest. Lastly, that investor appetite will continue to tilt toward \u201cstocks that favor diversification and both growth and value segments of the market in a relatively low interest rate environment that favors equities, real assets and other asset classes over fixed income for intermediate and longer-term objectives. The vaccine rollout is arguably the most important in determining the trajectory of the S&amp;P 500 next year. Ultimately the stock market is broadly dependent on economic growth to drive revenues and earnings across the sectors.\n* JP Morgan: $4400 - Investors are entering 2021 against a confluence of market-positive events, including improving prospects for widespread vaccinations and sustained economic reopening, gridlock in Washington and accommodative central bank policy. Given the COVID-19 crisis, vaccine distribution is likely the linchpin event. But even with widespread vaccine availability still months away, optimism over early vaccine efficacy data has already sparked a rally among stocks hardest-hit by the pandemic. The equity market is facing one of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years. After a prolonged period of elevated risks (global trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. election uncertainty, etc.), the outlook is significantly clearing with the business cycle expanding and risks diminishing. We expect a \u2018market nirvana\u2019 scenario for equities with the melt-up continuing into 1H21, driven by earnings recovery and multiple expansion. Much of next year\u2019s stock market rise is likely to come at the beginning of the year, as lingering uncertainties over vaccine distribution, the results of the Georgia senate race and additional monetary and fiscal stimulus start to dissipate. While the broader backdrop should still remain constructive in the second half of next year, by then the market will have likely priced in close to a full recovery and investors may start to expect a gradual shift in central bank forward guidance away from the current exceptionally accommodative stance.\n* BTIG - $4000 - Global synchronized growth underpinned by central bank ease and a Washington which sees Election 2020\u2019s decidedly mixed outcomes as a catalyst for cooperation (spend, it\u2019s necessary) and centrist government (no tax hikes) results in a Redistribution of Wealth consistent with the 2003-06 synchronized reflation period where Value outperformed. Growth, Small Cap outperformed Large Cap, and International equities outperformed the S&amp;P 500.\n\n**Gold:**\n\n* [Monthly](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GLD/TUbcSBg2-GLD/)\n* Gold had a solid year in 2020 gaining more than 20% as a long base breakout that triggered in June 2019 continued to play out higher and reached its measured move objective while the rally briefly broke above 2011 highs before pulling back. If we look at Fibonacci extension targets of the 2011-2015 correction GLD has upside targets at $207 and $220. The 2018-2020 rally has Fibonacci retracement support levels at $162.5 and $152.5. Gold rallied in 2020 on economic uncertainty and a flight to safety and has pulled back in Q4 with the greater optimism for 2021 taking hold. On an allocation basis, Gold may be losing some of its luster as a store of value with the momentum seen in Bitcoin , although that has not been seen to this point with global gold ETF inflows topping a record in 2020 as a way to diversify portfolios and hedge against inflation. However, November saw the second largest outflow on record. In 2020 the lockdowns resulted in a 5% decline in global output, so the supply-side is expected to rebound in 2021. Gold prices should be supported by inflationary pressures, a deep fiscal deficit and a weaker USD. Goldman sees Gold reaching $2300 in 2021 as recovery from the coronavirus-related recession fuels higher inflation next year. Further fuel could be added from a recovery in demand from India and China.",

        "selftext": "Ticker BABA on the nasdaq\n\nGo easy since its my first piece of DD, and I'm doing this to get different inputs on the company\n\nReason for DD: stock id down almost 30% from ATH\n\nI do not own any shares of alibaba \n\n \n\n*Processing img 8845zmm21r861...*\n\n**Quantitative assessment**\n\nAlibaba is a leading platform for global wholesale trade that serve million of buyers and suppliers around the world (mainly known for being prominent in Asia)\n\nLike amazon, their core e-commerce business consists of connecting third party sellers into one platform but, unlike amazon, they do not hold inventory and do not store /ship it.\n\n**How they make money**\n\n**E-commerce:** They make the main bulk of their money by charging a commission fee from transactions and a subscription fee to sellers. They say a 29% YoY growth in their revenues here.\n\n**Cloud operations:** From Investopedia: \u201cAlibaba Cloud provides enterprise customers with a complete suite of cloud services, including database, storage, management and application services, big data analytics, a machine-learning platform, and other services. The company's cloud computing segment generates revenue from enterprise customers based on the duration and specific usage of the services.\u201d This is the fastest growing segment of their business, reaching a 60% YoY revenue growth \n\n**Entertainment:** it\u2019s a small part of their business and generates subscription-based revenue (8% YoY revenue growth)\n\nIn Q3 2020, 84% of their revenue can be attributed to commerce and the other 16% to cloud/entertainment/innovation initiatives and others (10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively)\n\nBeing such a large company, they touch many sectors, lots of which are expected to keep growing quickly in the future.\n\n**Management**\n\nWould love to hear your input on this one (i.e. I'm too lazy to look into the decisions they make and I don't know how I feel about Jack Ma)\n\n**Competition**\n\nTheir main competitor is Amazon, but other ones include eBay and Tencent holdings (the latter a Chinese tech company). Alibaba is very dominant in the Asian e-commerce markets. \n\n**Recent concerns**\n\nAt the time of this writing, the stock is down almost 27% from its late-October peak, a drop in price attributed to a recent antitrust investigation launched by the Chinese government for monopolistic behavior by essentially forcing sellers to chose only a single e-commerce platform. Additionally, Ant Group (their fintech sister company) had been denied an IPO a while back and keeps getting scrutiny from the government. The main risk here for Alibaba might be that they\u2019re forced to divest some parts of their business. Personally, I think monopolistic concerns could keep emerging in the future as the company keeps growing however, I believe that despite these concerns, they can still strive as a business. There's plenty of YouTube videos and financial articles that cover this so I recommend those for more details.\n\n**Quantitative assessment (USD)**\n\nMarket cap: $650B \n\nQ3 2020 revenue: $22,8M (up 30% YoY, with forward projected growth of 36%)\n\nA few metrics stacked up against competitors (for the readers interpretation):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xte5e455qq861.png?width=1357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c1eb19bda6e576e1a2c8675fd7ca35f55a7baec\n\nThe recent drop in share price has BABA trading at a discount compared to its main competitor amazon. Growing revenues in all aspects of their business mentioned above is encouraging to see as well. \n\nAlibaba seems to offer great value in an expensive tech market (especially considering the low PE ratio despite growing their revenues pretty fast), the main question is: are the risks of Chinese government regulations that can be imposed on the company worth the opportunity? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI skimmed through the company pretty quickly and there's plenty of details in their fundamental business that I didn't talk about, I just tried to give a big picture view. I recommend also doing your own research on the risks with this company since government investigations seem complex and there's other risks such as the fact that you're actually buying a holding company legally domiciled in the Cayman Islands.  \n\n That Investopedia article I referred to: [How Alibaba Makes Money: core e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121714/how-does-alibaba-make-money-simple-guide.asp) \n\nAlibaba q3 results presentation:  [Alibaba Group September Quarter 2020 Results](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/ir/presentations/pre201105.pdf) \n\nActual q3 financial results pdf: [Microsoft Word - Alibaba Group Announces September Quarter 2020 Results\\_vF](https://alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p201105.pdf) \n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on Alibaba\n\nAlso, happy new year!",

        "selftext": "What is everyone\u2019s opinion on Biden\u2019s new relationship with China and the extent of the Ant /alibaba probe effect on the whole sector ? It seems like PDD , JD and baidu are near or at 52 week highs so investors aren\u2019t totally shy about these stocks as they are a more attractive growth story than many large cap American stocks. I can see ant selling off assets and still having a Fintech presence with their holding company functioning as a bank . \n\nRight now I\u2019m just valuing Baba as being ANT free and I believe it\u2019s still quite an attractive value . Since Ma is no longer ceo of BABA it seems like the goal was more to penalize jack ma who has more of a symbolic stake in ant. \n\nJD is backed by both Google and Walmart, connected with cloud flare and I can\u2019t see it failing, it seems like the best mid to long term growth potential and tencent will slowly grow and is discounted because of BABA as well imo . PDD and BIDU seem quite loved but I\u2019m not really feeling their business models .  Will wallstreet have a short memory once ant is heavily regulated or will caution towards investments in China deepen?",

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, core cannabis revenues totaled $30.5 million, a 168% increase compared with $11.4 million for the first nine months of 2019;\n* Gross profit from the core cannabis business increased 221% to $8.7 million for Q3 compared with $2.7 million for the same period in 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, gross profit from the core cannabis business totaled $19.7 million, a 159% increase from $7.6 million for the first nine months of 2019;\n* EBITDA for Q3 was $4.4 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $733,000 for the same period in 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, EBITDA totaled $8.6 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $1.3 million for the first nine months of 2019;\n* The foregoing 2019 revenues, gross profit and EBITDA information have been adjusted, for comparative purposes, to remove the impact from the one-time sales of hemp seeds during the same periods in 2019; and\n* The Company continues to take steps to improve financial flexibility and improve liquidity through debt restructuring activities.\n\nJon Levine, CFO of MariMed, added \u201cDuring the quarter, we improved our balance sheet and financial flexibility by converting short-term, high interest rate debt to longer-term debt on much more attractive terms. We appreciate our lenders\u2019 and investors\u2019 continued support and believe this result reflects both the recognition of our progress to date, and shared confidence in our business strategy.\u201d\n\n**Where The Company is Headed:**\n\n* Extend geographic reach through direct ownership of cannabis licenses and related seed-to-sale operations in US and internationally.\n* Expand presence in new hemp-derived CBD market with premium materials and products.\n* Enhance Marketing and customer education of products, benefits and changing modalities.\n* Continue to provide best in class development, management and operational advisory to approved facilities nationwide.\n* Enter ancillary services at the top and bottom of supply chains, including seeds, branded products and e-commerce retail. \n* Advance field of research to legitimize and strengthen our go-to-market reach.\n\n**Technical Analysis:** \n\nI am not good with technical analysis. I am a big fan of Petedoom on twitter and his analysis. I have linked it below: \n\n[https://twitter.com/petedoom/status/1343565915103879168?s=20](https://twitter.com/petedoom/status/1343565915103879168?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/petedoom/status/1343891292141596679?s=20](https://twitter.com/petedoom/status/1343891292141596679?s=20)\n\n**Why I Like It:** \n\nMariMed in my opinion seems heavily undervalued. The company has increased revnues by 220% from Q3 2019 and increased gross profits by 221%. The company has a vast majority of partnerships which seem to bolster MariMed's profitability. The company has a vast array of products with good brands, CRM technology, education and research to support it. \n\nLastly, the marijuana legalization bill passed in the house recently. Despite the Senate vote being unlikely, under a Biden administration Cannabis should head up. \n\nLook in Mexico what's happening: \n\n[https://twitter.com/tomangell/status/1345075802405281792?s=20](https://twitter.com/tomangell/status/1345075802405281792?s=20)\n\nUSA: \n\n[https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884)\n\nCanada: \n\nLook at similar Canadian plays! \n\nAll in all, with everything MariMed has to offer the company is currently valued at 47 cents? Seems heavily undervalued to me. I believe that if cannabis plays heat up, this most certainly could be one to heat up too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope you guys enjoyed!
