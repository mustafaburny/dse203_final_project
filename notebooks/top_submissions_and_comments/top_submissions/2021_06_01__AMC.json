We own 80% of AMC and it is shorted 20% that we know of (plenty more that we don't). 43% of BB is owned by institutions and shorted 10% that we know of. I think something is up.

Do you see the problem?? CLF should AT LEAST be trading at 50% more than in january, but obviously, because a company has basic costs (running a furnace, personnel et cetera) - but at some point, with EVERY DOLLAR MORE THE PRODUCT COSTS, THE COMPANY WILL EARN DIRECTLY.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\nLet's say producing a ton of steel costs 500$ in total. If the price of a ton goes to 750, to company makes 250$ profit. If the price goes to 1000$, the company instantly **doubles** it profit, with the steel price just increasing by 50%. Now if the steel price goes to 1500!, the company could make 1000$ profit. **Price doubled from 750$ per tonne, but PROFIT QUADRUPLED!**\n\nObviously there's a bit more to that, but that's the gist.\n\nWHY CLF - A CHAD CEO \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 :\n\nCEO LOURENCO GONCALVES is a fucking stud.

        "selftext": "You guys need some re-assurance or a reason to buy more AMC? Here's some dd. Last week and today AMC has had a very good rally, but this is just the beginning, now let me tell you why. (I know finance can be dense and complicated so i'll try to keep it simple)\n\n# TLDR\n\n\\- There's a lot of options between 30 and 40 being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares causing a Gamma Squeeze today and after hours. If more large option volume is placed tomorrow between 40-50 the Gamma Squeeze will keep going. \n\n\\- Short holders will lose a lot of money as share price continues up, forcing them to buy more AMC to close their position sometime through the week. \n\n\\- \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\n\n# DD\n\nThe past few weeks have been great for meme stocks, but AMC is leading at the frontline of this rally outperforming the others like GME, BB, etc, boasting a 112% increase the past week. One of the reasons i've been able to hold confidence in, is AMC's option volume. A call is a promise to sell you 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. Behind this contract, are people called Market Makers. These are people sitting at Wallstreet, writing contracts for people to buy options if there is a lack of supply. Now let's look at the option chain for today expiring next week\n\n[Weekly call options from yahoo finance](https://preview.redd.it/4k3vjjb70r271.jpg?width=1327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0358dcc16a0a79ffbb1bbc292969a0c4f035494b)\n\nIf we look at the 3rd column from the right, that's the current volume of call options. Whenever people buy options, in order for market makers to minimize as much risk as possible, they buy stock in order to stay \"delta neutral\". Fancy phrase I know. A very basic explanation is that no matter where the stock moves, the market makers don't lose money. Their goal isn't to bet against you, their goal is to scalp the bid/ask margins. Now notice how the option volume is particularly high at 30, 35, and 40. As the price moves closer to these strike prices, market makers got to buy more shares in order to stay delta neutral. Now with this high volume, market makers need to buy **A LOT** more shares everytime the price goes up, which then snowballs larger and larger causing something called a \"Gamma squeeze\", which basically means STONK GO UP. Last week a similar phenomenon occured, now we can see it will especially rally up at the 30 (which it did), 35(which it did), and 40 mark (soon to come). Once we get closer to 40 hopefully tomorrow there will be more options being placed in order for the Gamma squeeze to continue, but until then we have the next phase.... the famous.... short squeeze...\n\nGamma squeeze is caused by an incrementation of options being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares to minimize their risk. Now that we've hit this point, the price has gone up a lot. Today alone AMC went up 40%. And. that. is. big. oh. no. to. short holders. Short holders are holding AMC to profit off of AMC to go down, luckily for us, these guys have not learnt their lesson! With AMC mooning from the Gamma squeezes, short holders will be hard red and and are **forced** to close out of their short position, requiring them to buy AMC driving the price up even further! This is what brought GME to it's peak of 400$/share. If we look at the short interest a month ago. \n\n[Last month short interest from Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/2k2ey4k64r271.jpg?width=1180&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ab47fb7e917b0fb861253378e6f95c613cf080a)\n\nWe can see here AMC was 20% shorted. Through the month short holders continued to close more and more causing AMC to go up and up. This drove the value higher and higher, and now AMC is busting 38$/share. Now notice that cute little tick at the bottom. \n\n[Two week ago short interest from Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/a1uk4ca35r271.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8aee30112fd867588b91a90a2870ac60bf3bb619)\n\nWe can see here AMC short interest dropped to 16% but it looks like these short holders are doubling down and are increasing their short position. Today alone we busted 40% increase in AMC, if we can keep going we can make short holders force to close and climb even higher heights. 16-20% doesn't seem like much, but doing the math.... \n\nTotal shares in circulation = 448m ([taken from yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics/))\n\nFloat % = 18% (paid ortex subscription as shown above)\n\nShares shorted = 80.6million\n\n80.6 \\* 37$ (current AMC share value at the time of writing) = $2.983b\n\n.... needed to buy AMC. And that's before the AMC rocket takes off, it'll be even more while the rocket flies. So if any of you need any extra re-assurance, or a reason to put more money in, here ya go. If you guys want to continue the Gamma Squeeze, keep in mind the price needs momentum to carry up. Don't buy ridiculously far out call options like 70s or 80s because that won't give the stock an opportunity to climb up the 40s-60s range. It needs to be an incremental climb. \n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own research, and if you got any corrections for me please let me know! I'll edit my post or remove it completely if i missed/did something wrong\n\n# Reversal\n\nI'd be bs'ing you if i didn't say that this could go horribly wrong. The narrative i explained isn't **guaranteed to work**. In the case of bad news, or a large sell off, this can cause the price to fall or halt. Then the Gamma squeeze can't be sqoze which will then prevent the Short squeeze. Another point to keep in mind is we don't know **exactly** when the short holders will cover. They can double down and wait us out, but if we can keep the Gamma squeeze going, they'll have to close. To hold shorts you must pay a premium of [10%](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) every year to hold onto the shorts. This fee can increase though, and it has been steadily increasing as the price continues to go up. Please don't bet more than you can lose in case of these events. As for me, i'm waking up at market open tomorrow and yolo'ing the rest of my 10k into more call options before the rocket blasts.  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11",

The site, which requires stockholders to self-identify and sign-up for the chain\u2019s loyalty program, contains \u201cspecial offers\u201d and company updates.**\n\nOne of those special offers is a free tub of popcorn.\n\nAMC\u2019s retail investors have [propped up company since January](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/amcs-ceo-wants-to-use-the-meme-frenzy-as-a-springboard-for-growth.html), sending the stock up more than 1,400% in the last five months. Shares were up more than 20% in premarket trading Wednesday. \n\nThe company said it had 3.2 million individual shareholders as of March 11, who own about 80% of the 450 million shares outstanding. Many of them were inspired by the r/wallstreetbets Reddit page to purchase the stock. The forum selected several companies that were being shorted by large hedge fund groups and decided to take action.\n\nCEO Adam Aron has praised these investors for their support. The company delayed its annual shareholders meeting by more than a month in order to give these investors an opportunity to attend the event and \u201cmake their important voices heard.\u201d\n\nAron and AMC both plan to [donate $50,000 to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/amc-ceo-adam-aron-raved-about-its-reddit-investors-on-an-earnings-call.html) \u2014 a clear nod to these new investors, who call themselves apes and refer to Aron as \u201cSilverback.\u201d AMC also has shifted its communication style to speak directly with shareholders via social media, including YouTube. Aron has even taken a renewed interest in Twitter, \u201cfollowing\u201d hundreds of accounts tied to the \u201cape army.\u201d\n\nAMC Investor Connect is the next step in the company\u2019s strategy of connecting with these investors. The platform provides shareholders with exclusive promotions, like free or discounted items and invitations to special screenings, as well as direct communications with Aron.\n\n\u201cDuring my five-plus year tenure as CEO at AMC, I\u2019ve taken great pride in the relationships I have forged with AMC\u2019s owners,\u201d Aron said in a statement Wednesday**. \u201cWith AMC Investor Connect, that effort in relationship building will continue apace even if our shareholders now number in the millions. After all, these people are the owners of AMC, and I work for them.\u201d**",

        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. \n\nThe market, in general, has continued to rally strongly and it has been a pretty good week for investors. The top growing stocks I [shared last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntlyqy/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) had made an average return of 6.6% with Workhorse Group making a whopping 19% return in one week! Now, let\u2019s jump right into this week\u2019s list!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p9znai9z91571.png?width=1042&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=064000d3d54a7e847dc1bec4905f9380db5e05c8\n\nAMC and BB are now the top 2 most discussed stock! Both generated almost the same amount of discussion, but investors, in general, were more bullish about Blackberry as reflected in the sentiment. The returns on both the stocks were muted with AMC and BB returning just 3% and 2% respectively. ECommerce platform ContextLogic(WISH) had a wild ride with the stock rising 90% and then dropping 46% over the next two days. Investor returns wise, Clover health is the front runner returning an insane 67% in one week. Also, Tesla dropped out of the top 10 list for the first time in 2021!\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/s5j78yn0a1571.png?width=1233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=241763eda48057740436f648ba342b56a7999cd4)\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**Wendys($WEN):**\u00a0This was definitely a long time coming. Wendys shares soared more than 19% on Tuesday after the company became a meme stock in Reddit. There was no new fundamental news from the company that changed the investment perspective other than an announcement that the company will bring back its popular Summer Strawberry Chicken Salad.\n\n**Clover Health($CLOV):**\u00a0had its best week yet since inception with the stock returning 67% in just one week. Reddit investors sparked another rally with the stock price soaring more than 200% and then fell sharply! The stock was trading at 6 times the normal volume. Even though the company has an optimistic business model, the current rally was predominantly driven by CLOV\u2019s high short interest (43%)!\n\n**Senseonics Holdings($SENS):**\u00a0$SENS exploded in mentions and the stock jumped 22% during intraday trading without any new news from the company. Its a small Maryland-based pharma company, which specializes in the development of products made to ease the burden of diabetes monitoring. The company had announced news of a promising trial but that was long back. The current rally was majorly based on its short interest (25%) and increasing chatter!\n\n**Clean Energy Fuels($CLNE):**\u00a0$CLNE had a wild week with the stock shooting up 31% on Wednesday due to the retail crowd but then promptly tumbled 17% in Thursday afternoon trading. The drop was due to the information that its largest shareholder reduced their stake in the company by 1.25 Million shares. The retail crowd is still extremely bullish on the stock as seen by the sentiment.\n\n**Invesco Mortgage($IVR):** The company had a spectacular crash at the beginning of the pandemic with the shares losing almost 90% of its value. It has been growing slowly over the past few months. The stock was trending in relation to the current uncertainty regarding inflation rates and how Fed is going to adjust its rates.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\u00a0ContextLogic($WISH) chatter grew by 487% and UWM Holdings($UWMC) by 373% but were not high enough to make the top 5 list. Another interesting finding from my program is that mentions of CPI (Consumer Price Index) grew by more than 900% last week showcasing the rising discussion about inflation and its impact among investors.\n\nHope you enjoyed this week\u2019s top stocks issue! \u00a0\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "selftext": "After 2 weeks of AMC hype videos filling up my YT recommendation lists, countless online \"analysts\" completely bullish on the impending \"gamma squeeze\" that was all but assured to hit on Friday 6/18.... today passed with not much difference than any other day.\n\nIt honestly feels like we're playing poker at a high stakes table with the Hedge Funds with our cards facing up and looking around the room like we're secretly the smartest guy at the table.\n\nIs it time for us to truly snap back into reality and really look at what's going on here?  Let's be honest... the hedge funds have had weeks/months to learn from their GME mistakes.  Any call options that would have been out of the money today was probably already hedged against days/weeks ago.  Even if they let $40 and $50 OTM options expire today, they are probably recuperating their losses in profits elsewhere in their portfolio.  There may never come a situation where the AMC short squeeze will actually happen.  The gamma squeeze??  Well, that's already happened when it spiked from $10 to $72.  If that's not \"to the moon\", I'm not sure what is, especially for a stock that is 70% over-valued atm.\n\nI understand that this is a \"movement\" and that it's \"ape/retailers vs the big funds\" but I'm also seeing alot of people here yolo their entire savings onto a meme stock.  Am I the only one who thinks that we're doing a complete disservice to the amateur investors here who do not really know what they are doing and \\*actually\\* thinking they are making wise investments?\n\nAt the end of the day, there is no reality where the big hedge funds will just sit &amp; watch and roll-over while we squeeze AMC to $100+ and then tuck their tails between their legs and just swallow the losses without any strategic plan.  I think anyone who is still waiting and believing in this will be the ones left holding the bag.  The same people who held at $20 will be holding at $60, will still be holding even at $120 (if that ever comes) and one day, they will be left holding the bag regretting all of the chances they had to cash out for profit along the way.  Do these \"diamond hands\" actually have an exit plan?\n\nAs the old saying goes, it's not a loss until you sell.  But the inverse is also true.  It's never a gain if you hold forever either.  Am I missing something here or are we still all convinced that the hedge funds will stare down an oncoming semi-truck and just stand there like a deer in headlights while retailers rob them blind?  Something makes that very hard to believe....",

The news release shows an image which all of us have recently been talking about, and it is basically consistent with what we thought.\nI am sharing a simple summary that may help to draw a clear and simple picture based on public data.\n- 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021\n- approximately 4.1 million1 individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting\n- More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares.\nShares held by retail investors ~ 80% x 501,780,240 ~ 401,424,192\n- As of June 9th, 2021 from a top brokerage firm:\nInstitutional Stock Ownership 12.6%\nInstitutional Mutual Fund Ownership 10.4%\nMutual Fund Ownership 3.2%\nInsider Ownership 6.5%\nOther 67.4%\n\nTotal of institution ownership:\n12.6% + 10.4% + 3.2% = 26.2%\nTotal of the rest excluding individual retail investors:\n26.2% + 6.5% = 32.7%\nEquivalent number of shares covered by record excluding shares from individual owners:\n32.7% x 501,780,240 = -164,082,138 shares\nShares needed to cover the records:\n-63.72M = 501.78M - 401.42M - 164.08M\n- Synthetic shares:\ntotal number of synthetic shares: Z\nnaked shorts: X\nnaked call contracts: Y\nother naked shares: W\nZ = X + Y + W\nShort interest:\nAssuming 21% SI which is about 100.4M shares\nMinimum number of synthetic shares from public records:\n100.4M - 63.72M ~ 37M (assume all 63.72M shares were still amid transactions, this is very unlikely)\nHidden number of synthetic shares:\nU: a lot discussions in forums estimate that this number is huge.\nMinimum number of synthetic shares\n37M + U\n- Bottom line:\n37M or MUCH MUCH MORE synthetic shares will have to be covered by real shares, most of these shares need to be from individual investors.\n\nHope this post can be helpful to some of you to understand the current picture of $AMC.

AMC currently have a *market cap* of **30 BILLION** with a *float* of **448.49 MILLION** and only **13.45% Short Interest** as of last Friday.\n\nNow because the float &amp; market cap of WKHS is much lower, it takes significantly less bananas to get the rocket ship going. WKHS only needs a mere fucking fraction of the volume AMC saw for it to see a Thanos Infinity Squeeze and fuck the shorts to kingdom come.\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\n[This is my take on le squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/j7eyz7id25671.png?width=2672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0c124f1d0a848dd4deb3e0303154e4332123496)\n\nNow listen here you fucks, I do have data to back this up. ORTEX send out trading signals based on algorithmic backtesting or some bullshit like that. They sent out a Short Squeeze Signal on June 10th, which according to them you are likely to see the highest returns *11 days* after the signal was fired, which would be on the 25th of June.\n\n[SS Signal](https://preview.redd.it/3tecoxx835671.png?width=2472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad5d18dcc26caf74bb0f358b59efc590f1ac4eaa)\n\nSo now, let's compare the ORTEX data now with the previous squeeze.\n\n[ORTEX data with estimated Short Interest for WKHS](https://preview.redd.it/8eyf1oeo35671.jpg?width=3200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98399c773dc00abb4938c20c655976bdccf09671)\n\nLooking at the previous squeeze that occurred on the 26th of Jan, we can see that it gapped up to a high of **$42.96** on just **33% Short Interest**. Now imagine what the fuck we could do with **60%**.\n\nHow I see it is, we are so close to seeing a huge run up to at least **$30**. For you monkeys that don't math, that's a **+100% gain**, and anyone will the balls to yolo options you'll see significantly more.\n\nI don't know why I don't see anyone posting their positions anymore but here they are:\n\n120x Jul 16 45/60 Bull Debit Spreads  \n1x Jun 25 15.5c  \n2x Jun 25 16c  \n5x Jul 02 18c  \n50 Shares\n\n**TLDR:** WKHS has 60% Short Interest and is the next trip to the fucking moon.",

You want to do something with BB, just like GME and AMC? Buy and hold, and let the market catch up to the potential that BB will become. \n\nI'm sure a lot of you heard that GME and AMC might be added to RUSSELL 1000 based on performance by June 25 - well BB's earning report will be out at around the same time, June 23.

        "selftext": "Dear Apes, I'm writing to you today to tell you a few things. I see many people not understanding and wanting to. A lot of people spreading misinformation, etc. I want to clear the air and inform you crayon eaters.\n\nWelcome to WSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit, the home of the Apes. We are collectively we are considered one of the largest hedge funds in the world. There are many baby crayon eating apes whom are eager to eat some tasty banana's. Many of you question how any of us make money, so please feel free to ask questions in the comments as I will be answering as many as possible, although keep in mind I am not a financial advisor, I simply love the stonks.\n\nThe main topic and example today is $CLOV. You've most likely been hearing a lot about it. Let me explain the hype behind our four leaf clover and what you need to expect and do to make some crispy chicken tendies (currency).\n\n$CLOV is a very shorted stock currently with an approximate short float of 50% (please correct me if I'm wrong). A short in simple terms is when someone bets on the stonk going down in value. They 'borrow' the stonk at $50, and give it back to the lender at the lower price of $20. Profiting $30. But here's the catch. If they 'borrow' the stonk at $50 and it going up to $100, they must buy the stonk at $100. Which will raise the price of the stonk. Make sense?\n\nGood. Now, what causes the short squeeze? Truth is, many factors. WSB as a whole usually rallys around certain (meme) stonks that are either undervalued and/or highly shorted. Once we do it causes a jump in price. The shorts wet themselves from a gamma squeeze (high volume trading from Apes dumping all tendies into a stonk). This causes them to eventually have to pay back their shorts at a ridiculous price and I'm turn causes the stock to go up. \n\nWhat is the perfect recipe? Well, because it's so highly shorted and we have a ton of Apes hoping on the stonk going to the moon, they've bet on it. Opening many contracts on the four leaf clover. Once the price reaches above a certain value, many will 'exercise' their contracts (which means actually purchase their shares at the 'strike' price they set it to. Causing a huge influx of shares to be taken at once. \n\nIs it too late to purchase $CLOV? No, it's not. Is it going to go up? It depends on us. If you hold, the shorts will need to pay those banana's back to us at the higher price. Did you get it too late? If you purchased below $25 so far, you will profit if you hold. $CLOV isnt as much of a meme stonk as you think. They have great fundamentals and actually is a great business. So everyone that has purchased, don't worry. You'll profit if you hold. What you're seeing now is only a gamma squeeze caused by us, and everything is going to plan. \n\nWhat will the price hit? When do I sell? Good question, no one ever knows. But I can tell you personally, this will hit $50 no problem if we just work together. The stonk market is a scary place, but we have the power in numbers.\n\nDid I miss out? Should I buy now? It's up to you, I'm not s financial advisor. Personally I'm doubling down tomorrow at open, no matter the price. So do what you must with that information.\n\nTo all of those stuck on AMC and GME. This is not for you. This is also not a distraction from either of those. Feel free to go with your gut. What I'm telling you, is there is tons of opportunity here, and there will be enough tendies for everyone.\n\nApes, stay calm, follow the drill. I wish every single one of you, the best luck. \ud83c\udf40 After all, we have the $CLOVer on our side. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAMA \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f",

Because IV is so high, it makes it much much harder to profit off of buying options contracts because they become way overpriced.

        "selftext": "I want to start off by saying this is not a post comparing CLOV to GME or AMC. While these stocks have some similarities, particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes, I\u2019m not going to get into that. This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing, still learning about shorts and squeezes, and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what\u2019s going on with this stock. You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/ngesez/this_is_the_bottom_and_youll_be_top_of_the_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).\n\n**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**\n\n**What Is Clover Health?**\n\nClover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient\u2019s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. \n\nCurrently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company\u2019s stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.\n\n[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &amp;#37; of growth compared to competitors \\(cloverhealth.com\\)](https://preview.redd.it/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)\n\nCLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.\n\n**Positive Catalysts**\n\nAll the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I\u2019m keeping an eye on: \n\n* DOJ/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they\u2019ll pay a fine and that\u2019ll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it\u2019s related to Medicare. \n* Biden\u2019s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.\n* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.\n* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They\u2019re growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.\n\n**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**\n\n* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it\u2019s unclear when it will be settled. Although it\u2019s priced in, it is still something to watch out for.\n* Hindenturd\u2019s constant attacks despite insisting they don\u2019t have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren\u2019t benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg\u2019s report was created to hurt all of Chamath\u2019s IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I\u2019ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)\n* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you\u2019ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.\n\n**Let\u2019s get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**\n\nCLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it\u2019s unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it\u2019s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it\u2019s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won\u2019t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.\n\n[CLOV S\\/I&amp;#37; as reported by Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)\n\nNo need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren\u2019t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won\u2019t be any dilution.\n\nThe P/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let\u2019s talk about CLOV\u2019s P/S ratio for a moment. \n\nCLOV\u2019s 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV\u2019s market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I\u2019m using the 2018/19 valuation to be conservative.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nThe fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers\u2019 manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren\u2019t reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they\u2019ve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they\u2019ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there\u2019s no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.\n\nCLOV\u2019s Response to Hindenburg Allegations: [https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research/17921324.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research/17921324.html)",

        "selftext": "PLTR has come up in this subreddit a lot in the past and people have been burned on it as well. I've lost thousands on PLTR but i'm still holding because the company is beyond incredible. One of the biggest questions i've seen that nobody truly understands is \"What is Palantir? What do they do?\", so let me attempt to explain wtf they do... Precursor, this isn't an in-depth analyses of PLTR fundamentals and financials. If you want to look at their fundamentals you can check some other dd like this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9ydod/palantirs_pltr_fundamentals_just_became_even/). It's about a month old, but it's still incredibly relevant now. This post is meant to address the general question of what PLTR is as a company, what they do, and bring some general attention to the interesting options volume this week.\n\n*This is not financial advice. Do your own research!!! The more research i did in PLTR the more bullish i became.*\n\n# TL;DR\n\n\\- PLTR visualizes abstract data in a meaningful way for any business to easily analyze and efficiently run their business.\n\n\\- PLTR is a modular system that allows for companies to connect with each other seemlessly creating an interconnected community for data to travel which will create waves in how business is conducted.\n\n\\- PLTR is an engineering master piece that is incredibly unique. For anyone to compete with them will be difficult to put it lightly.\n\n\\- PLTR has been sleeping for a while, it's ready for a rally if we can get enough attention due to high Open Interest and low IV.\n\n\\- [Karp is a Giga Chad](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQwLx-qpgHrcSU27NjPrIq6LBMCkjMG6HIfjZCcVKRmhQmlyNwx)\n\n# What is Palantir?\n\n\"Palantir is a platform for data analytics and ai\", I've seen this thrown around quite a bit, and honestly wtf does that mean? I'm a programmer and even i don't fucking get it. Well all became clear after the [demo day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFP3sBQfaww) came out, where finally PLTR showcased their platforms which people are sleepin on. Before we can answer what PLTR is, we need to answer \"what is data\"? Data is the logical representation of the real world. Any largescale business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). So what does PLTR do with this data? Well they consolidate a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible easily digestible UI for the company to use. (Note that they take company's data, PLTR doesn't gather or store any data of it's own) Easy right? This allows for pretty much any company/organization like [the CDC for medicine](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-to-help-u-s-track-covid-19-vaccines-11603367276), the [military for national security](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/21-launch/), and the [stock market for financial fraud](https://twitter.com/PalantirTech/status/1399747624463486986) (stock market is only rumors for now but hopefully PLTR HELP US FIND THE HEDGIES THAT MANIPULATE THE MARKET) . But how insane is this? Working with that much data is a nightmare. In a society where data is already a necessity, being able to look through and analyze data quickly for any anomalies or patterns is crucial to any company and is often overwhelming. With PLTR a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that PLTR detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, PLTR had a huge hand in this. PLTR gives visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that has risen if any, allowing for fast response time. You can imagine PLTR displaying a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator can click 1 of these shipments/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where are things going, what kind of picture does the data represent, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. Now this is just an example, PLTR is general enough and customizable enough where it can represent any business/organization's structure. Once data is organized it opens up the possibility for even further opportunities such as creating simulations of potential issues that can happen in order to forsee and plan for various situations. It allows data to be clean enough to train machine learning algorithms (a big problem with ML is that data isn't clean or has weird edge cases that fucks up the model. If you talk to any data/ml engineer they will typically mention most of their job is cleaning data over actual application). Companies can create scripts or AI to respond to events if needed. It can be as simple as notifying an executive if an issue occurs, or completely issuing a rollback order if there's a sudden spike of side effects for the covid vaccine which will be represented in the data. It's the ultimate data representation/analysis platform that any company can utilize and it's fucking insane, i still casn't believe PLTR managed to do this. But it brings up a few problems.\n\n# Why Palantir?\n\nWhy can't companies just create their own platform? Because it's expensive, time consuming, and complicated. A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Take the automotive industry for example and self driving. Driving data needs to be collected and stored for AI. That's a lot of data... like pentabytes of data if not more.... Now let's say there's data being collected in America, the signs and the messages on side walks, are different than those that are in the UK. If you have a dataset from the UK well that data comes with it's own issues and rules, this creates a problem called \"data silos\" meaning data is separated into it's own little circle separated from other data silos. If the company decides to make a platform to analyze these 2 different types of data, they will have to consolidate, organize, and create 2 kinds of platforms for it. Now this example is only 2, large businesses have dozens of data silos that are often abandoned or isolated. PLTR is a generalized platform that encompasses any and all kinds of data which they themselves work closely with companies in order to cater to what they need. Why can't companies create a general platform themselves? Because it's an engineering nightmare and PLTR is an engineering masterpiece.... It is so insanely difficult to create something general enough to fit any and all data... but PLTR has done exactly that. The best comparison i can correlate this to is computers. Before generalized computers, computers would be built and deployed to do 1 job and 1 job only. Once generalized computers came out it's used everywhere and no company develops their own computer for a single job, they go out and buy a computer, in this case, any company that manages data can benefit from PLTR.\n\nAnother benefit we see from PLTR is that PLTR is 1 huge modular system. If a person from 1 company wants to share data with another company that utilizes PLTR they can do so seemlessly. PLTR talks with each other and easily sends data to and from. Imagine if hospitals or universities adapted this system. You no longer have to manually print a transcript and submit it to the other university's administration and then wait for it to be processed for a few days. If your medical records are stored in 1 hospital and you get sent to the ER in another hospital, your main hospital can send your medical records to the ER you're at seemlessly and quickly. Its insane how misunderstood PLTR is, but it's a far reaching company that will dig into the roots of all whether you jump into it or not, all i'm doing is trying to have it move sooner than later. Deep roots are not reached by the forst.\n\nKarp is a giga chad. Fucking guy got the intelligence of Elon Musk if not more, and the hair to fucking prove it. If you want to witness it first hand, listen to some of his[interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjjHdys2Ph4). A lot of his philosophies are amazing and I believe in his abilities to make PLTR go to the moon. \ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\n\nIf anyone's worried that the military may drop PLTR, [here ya go](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/).\n\n# Why now?\n\nI did a DD on AMC a week ago calling the rally from $20 -&gt; $70. Will the same happen with PLTR? **It can** but it'll need some help. Not gonna explain how the squeeze works as it's beyond the scope of this post. If you want check out the [DD i did on AMC](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqa5x8/why_amc_is_rallying_and_why_it_will_continue/), i explain the idea there.\n\n[PLTR Option Chain from Yahoo Finance](https://preview.redd.it/e10egiyiac571.png?width=1363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db92a97940da7189c65e524fe3e6595c70eb638e)\n\nfucking options volume is even higher than AMC when i did AMC's DD. Now PLTR has a larger market cap than AMC so we probably won't see a run up as large as AMC but it's still a great stock with great opportunity. If we can get enough people to get on PLTR it can definitely pop. The options volume is spread out very nicely through the 20-30 range which is perfect for launching the price forward. Meme stocks typically has a second coming. GME had a 2nd wind, BB had a 2nd wind, AMC's 2nd wind is nuttier than it's first one ffs, it looks like it's about time for PLTR to have it's 2nd wind, but it needs more attention.\n\n# Why not AMC/GME/BB/etc?\n\n**I love memes and have made a lot of money off memes.** As much as I love AMC and GME, I sold at the top. I sold AMC at 70, and i sold GME at 400. Why? **Because Meme stocks need to cool down**. This isn't because of hedgies or any kind of attacks. Stocks that are very volatile causes their options to be ridiculously expensive, which prevents the potential for a rally from happening because it's much harder for people to buy in options. Ultimately I don't want to be a bag holder, and i don't want others to be bag holding (rip GME 400$ holders and AMC 70$ holders). Everyone should look for selling opportunities, for GME it was RH closing down and AMC was when the rally ran it's course. (Check the AMC DD above if you need proof, i updated the post as soon as i sold at $70. GME unfortunately I have no proof for) I will still look for opportunities to buy into GME/AMC again once it's cooled down a bit but for now, PLTR is really cheap, volatility is really low, and we're sitting at the floor right now with huge potential for it to explode. People have been burnt before when PLTR was cooling off from the past, but now **the second coming is near....** We're at the floor right now so if the narrative doesn't play out it's also just a great stock to hold.\n\n# Reversal/Exit\n\nUnfortunately PLTR doesn't have the same attention as AMC did when i wrote the last DD, so in order for it to pop off this week PLTR will need some love. Even if not enough people realizes how amazing it actually is then it'll just sit steady and grow over time. For PLTR i don't really have an exit. If it does rally i will sell and let it cool, but i'll update this post if that happens. If that doesn't ever happen, then i'll just keep PLTR as a long term hold, and re-allocate funds to riskier plays based on my risk tolerance and when opportunity arises. Other than that I'm more than happy to hold PLTR for years to come. PLTR already has pretty much everything i own right now... All my money, my commitment, my wife... o\\_o PLTR is my wife's boyfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Position**:\n\n4250 shares at $23.32\n\n40x $27 calls 7/9\n\n10x $30 calls 7/9\n\n(I do think PLTR will moon sooner, sometime within the week with enough attention but I don't want to get dicked by Theta so i bought calls a bit further out. I plan on buying weeklies tomorrow morning for the big dick yolo)\n\n47x $30 calls 1/21/22 (the long term hold)",

The selling pressure by RETAIL were too intense that the professionals were not able to stop the fall in time. Thats why we say that the market falls faster than they rise. At $37, they managed to stop the fall as it takes time to stop a fast train.The same thing applies to your car, if you are driving at 200km/hr , even if you apply the brake, your car will take time to stop. Isnt it\n\nWhat I found interesting with AMC chart is that we clearly see that the PROFESSIONALS put big money and tried hard to stop the fall but some retails put too much selling pressure. Professionals buying heavily, is a great signal of strength . When all these retards and weak hands are out, the bullish trend will continue and price will move higher. This is a certainty! \n\nI am doubling my position on Monday.\n\nTo all bears out there shorting AMC, i have some wise words for you ; its dangerous to stand in front of a train coming at you at 300km/hr! \n\nLets all get onboard AMC supersonic trains.

Has nice DDs.\n* New [Big Dick CEO](https://bgfoods.com/investor-relations/news/article/14091/) starts *today*. He's literally led a company to Mars. Before that he was the overlord of tendies dipping sauces at Heinz.\n* Priced at a discount to its peers, with significant Q2 and Q3 upside potential.\n* Passes [the SMELL test](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/): 2nd highest SI of dividend stocks (BBBY is #1), low liquidity, low IV.\n* It cums with the meme stocks.

All this on a day with zero news, except my one [moderately successful WSB post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvcyxf/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/).\n\nWWE's IV of 35% implied a 2.2% stddev in daily price change... so an 11% close represents a 5 sigma event. My take is that WWE got pregnant after getting fucked by WSB wearing *five* condoms. I think MMs got defensive by pumping up the ask and IVs during PM, possibly due to seeing sentiment pop. (Unfortunately, it didn't take WWE long to start showing pregnancy sickness -- she regurgitated some gains in the last couple of days.)\n\nWWE definitely came, and so did I. My FDs were up 2500%, and Jan LEAPs up 250%. However, in an act of sheer horniness after spending all day furiously writing the DD, I had posted it after close. So only those able to get in at open were able to appreciate the climax. **I'm not making that mistake this time.**\n\n## My point is: if you're looking for a broad who is so fertile that even a modest amount of WSB autist-sperm can knock her up a few points, then go for a SMELLy broad... they get knocked up easily.\n\nIn this case, I'm going gay and hoping BGS's [Green Giant](https://bgfoods.com/brands/green-giant) shows us more of his giant green cock. The fun doesn't stop there.. he'll bring along [Ass-Clapper Girl](https://bgfoods.com/brands/clabber-girl/), some [anorexic bitch](https://bgfoods.com/brands/skinnygirl-dressings/), a [certified MILF](https://bgfoods.com/brands/mama-marys/), and hell, even [Grandma](https://bgfoods.com/brands/grandmas/)! They'll even bring some [Crisco](https://bgfoods.com/brands/crisco/) \\-- anything to make you [cream](https://bgfoods.com/brands/cream-of-wheat/) or have a [perfect release](https://bgfoods.com/brands/bakers-joy/). If the thrill of evading the law is more your thing, they can bring along [some](https://bgfoods.com/brands/ortega/) [illegal](https://bgfoods.com/brands/buena-vida/) [immigrants](https://bgfoods.com/brands/las-palmas/), too.\n\nThe Aristocrats aside, BGS's **S**hort interest, **M**arket cap, **L**ow IV, and **L**iquidity make it one SMELLy bitch. As for **F**undamentals, I think they're solid. She's got a good heart, but who the fuck cares about that when she's got lovely DDs? Besides, \"f\" can't be jammed into a clever acronym. (Ok, I'm a softy and I actually care and I've included some fundamentals in this post.)\n\nAdd to that some aphrodisiacs:\n\n* [New big dick CEO](https://bgfoods.com/investor-relations/news/article/14091/) that deployed a turnaround story literally to Mars, prior to that he led Heinz's tendies dipping sauce team.\n* Q2 guidance teabagged the stock, so a surprise beat is very possible. Same for Q3.\n* Market Tailwinds: \"growth to value\" pick, should the trend continue. High divs, underpriced wrt peers.\n* Correlates with other squeeze stocks... is it still open season on shorts or nah?\n* Options are cheap as fuck (IV = 41%).\n\n...aaaaaand I'm hard.\n\nAlright. Enough foreplay. Let's get sniffing.\n\n# I. A Brief History of B&amp;G\n\nThe [full history](https://bgfoods.com/about/history/) of this perverted company is actually quite interesting, probably, if you read it. I didn't read it, I just mostly looked at the pictures:\n\n* In 1822 some Englishman started a condiment business in Boston in 1822, most likely to pay for the most advanced oral cosmetics of the day.\n* He then sells canned goods to Union troops.\n* That guy dies, but his freaky perverted goth sons takes over and make a deal with the devil to sell some unholy canned mixture of ground ham and \"special\" seasonings.\n* By 1889 two of these perverts become street walkers in Manhattan selling pickles by yelling \"get yer edible green dildos, here!\" from a horse and buggy.\n* In 1893 they they latch onto the BBC trend, and offer the not so subtle \"Cream of Wheat\"\n* While all this is going on, Mama Ortega squeezes out 13 kids, the 11th one establishes the \"Ortega\" brand.\n* I guess the freaky sons decided it a good idea to conglomerate a huge harem of the freakiest sounding brand names. Something about bagel chips too.\n* The rest is history!\n\nIn short, B&amp;G has a solid history of selling phallic foods and acquiring [euphemistic memeable brands](https://bgfoods.com/brands/) to create some sort of weird food brothel:\n\n* Green Giant\n* Cream of Wheat\n* Crisco\n* Skinny Girl\n* Clabber Girl\n* Baker's Joy\n* Moma Mary's\n* Grandma's\n* Accent Flavor Enhancer\n\nA true hags to riches story, this pimp of a company posted a record of $505m in Q1 sales, even in the face of supply shortages.\n\n# II.

One take is past company leadership hasn't been strong in developing and executing plans for growth or evolution of the company. They paid an unnecessarily high dividend at times (at various points it was a double digit % dividend), and prior management decided to accrue debt to complete deals even as it continued to pay high dividends.\n\nThey're also being shorted.\n\nTheir business is solid, though. From my perspective, I see a librarian with some light acne but with deep set sexual perversions just waiting for the right chad to unleash her. She's got nothing wrong with her, but she can't really sexually express herself comfortably -- until now she's just been dating some lazy ass cuck that can't find the clit.\n\nBasically: It\u2019s easier to fix broken management decisions quickly than to fix a broken underlying business. In BGS you have the former rather than the latter.\n\nSo how exactly will management get fixed?\n\n## New CEO\n\nEnter Kenneth \"Clit Killer\" Keller. Announced May 11th just before the Q1 earnings call, and starts this very day. Mans can find the clit.\n\nYou can read [the bio](https://bgfoods.com/investor-relations/news/article/14091/), or just get erect right now:\n\n**\u2611 M&amp;A of a larger, high growth business**\n\n&gt;Most recently, Mr. Keller served as president and CEO of JDE Peet\u2019s NV, a $7 billion global coffee and tea company with over 20,000 employees based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. He led the merger of Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE) and Peet\u2019s Coffee, Inc. and the successful initial public offering of the combined company in May 2020.\n\n**\u2611 Has literally led a company to Mars.** **\u2611 Can deliver a turnaround.**\n\n&gt;Prior to that, Mr. Keller served as global president of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, a subsidiary of Mars, Inc., where he was responsible for delivering sales and profit growth across the global gum, mints and candy business. In the United States, the company\u2019s largest global market, Mr. Keller led a turnaround of the Wrigley business, delivering growth well above the industry average. During the integration of Wrigley into Mars, Mr. Keller helped establish the global business units and strategy for the combined Mars-Wrigley confectionery business\n\n**\u2611 Former overlord of tendies dipping sauces.**\n\n&gt;He also worked at the H.J. Heinz Company in both the United States and Europe, leading the ketchup, condiments and sauces division in the United States\n\nThis guy has a solid track record of both turning around and growing companies that deal with packages that consumers put in their mouths (packaged foods, that is). It's a great sign he chose BGS for his next gig.\n\n## Q1 earnings, Q2 guidance\n\nFirst a reminder that this company absolutely crushed it during the start of COVID, where doomsday prepping of canned and frozen goods took hold. So, YoY comparisons were tough to beat. But beat them off it did.\n\nNet sales in Q1 rose to $505, from $449m last year, despite it being a tough comparison. The Crisco acquisition and strong net sales in the Spices and Seasonings brand area of $24.6 (47.5% Y/Y growth) more than offsetting reductions in Green Giant and other areas due to supply constraints (demand substantially exceeded supply -- a problem we all wish we had).\n\nE-commerce pimpery of their products increased by 60% Q1 '20 vs Q1 '21 to $50m. They expect it to grow to $250m for full year '21, and are focused on growing that aspect of the business. They also have the option to put Skinny Girl on OF, though it wasn't mentioned in the call.\n\nThe guidance for Q2? They're limited by supply, costs have risen, and last year's Q2 '20 will be difficult to top due to people stuffing their ~~panties~~ pantries. **This is very likely priced in,** as management was quite conservative on their earnings call and transparent about the supply issues, which aren't particularly severe to begin with. It's a good problem to have.\n\n[Further evidence this is priced in](https://www.barrons.com/articles/campbell-and-b-g-foods-have-outperformed-only-one-is-a-buy-for-this-analyst-51616436465):\n\n&gt;By contrast, he downgraded B&amp;G Foods (BGS) to Neutral from Overweight, while maintaining a $31 price target. Lavery writes that he finds it difficult to see upside to the stock\u2019s current valuation, especially as commodity-price inflation could lead to higher costs in the second half of this year and into 2022. That said, the company does have some ability to counteract this, like Campbell, via moves like hedging and price increases; even so, he estimates that B&amp;G Foods could face between 15% and 25% earnings per share risk this year\u2014and next\u2014if current commodity prices hold.\n\n## Addressing Risks\n\nAnalysts are treating BGS like it has ED, but **Green Giant is a grower not a shower**.\n\nBGS' supply chain and sales are primarily integrated across US, Canada, and Mexico vs many peers' more geographically dispersed sourcing and sales. BGS is thus well-insulated against global geopolitical/market trends toward de-globalization and global supply chain disruption risk, and has less exposure to ongoing COVID disruption due to North America's head start on vaccination and reopening.\n\nThey also have a strong history and relationship sourcing their inputs, which should give them an edge over private brands that will struggle to source competitively in a supply environment that's tighter than your wife's hot friends.\n\nIn short, anything they can source is sold, they're fuck buddies with COVID-proof and reliable growers, and as industry costs rise they can price better than the smaller off-brand competitors.\n\nGiven the worst is priced in, a good growing season is all it would take for a significant impact on the share price.\n\n# III. Macro Tailwinds and Catalysts\n\n## On COVID:\n\n* COVID lead to an unfortunate decline in eating out (pun intended, obviously). The upside to that is now consumers are slightly more apt at throwing frozen vegetables in the microwave. I expect that post-COVID people will remain more self-sufficient, and thus the demand for packaged goods will hopefully not decline much.\n* Even if the above is wrong: BGS's foodservice sales, which took an ass pounding from COVID, saw the beginnings of an uptick in March. This corresponds to the start of general reopening across the US as vaccine availability accelerated. Foodservice were still at pre-COVID levels in Q1, so Q2 should capture much more of that recovery, which might surprise in terms of speed and scale.\n* To the extent that people keep their COVID purchasing habits: As mentioned before: BGS e-commerce purchasing of their products increased by 60% Q1 '20 vs Q1 '21 to $50m. They expect it to grow to $250m for full year '21, and are focused on growing that aspect of the business.\n\n## On the Growth to Value rotation:\n\n* A further market shift from growth to value would be welcomed. BGS had no performance anxiety during COVID and offers a **6.3% yield**, and has authorized a **50m stock repurchase program**.\n* On the related subject of interest rates possibly rising: While they do have debt, they have limited exposure. The majority of their long-term debt, $1.45b is fixed-rate vs $906m variable rate.\n\n## Possible Catalysts:\n\n* As mentioned above, growth-to-value swing would really butter the biscuit.\n* If we see early signs of persistent COVID outbreaks, or vaccine-resistant variants, there will be another rush on BGS products. Also, as a stock BGS has proved resilient and a surprise upside performer, so it will be high on the list of defensive stocks.\n* Q2 earnings\n* Good crops of veggies throughout rest of year.\n* A short squeeze occurring from growth-to-value rotation\n* A short squeeze occurring in meme stocks (see below)\n\n# IV. Technicals\n\n## BGS SMELL Test\n\n[You can read about my SMELL test here.](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/)\n\n&gt;SMELL is my proprietary system scientifically engineered to maximize fear in the hearts of wall street. I identify tickers that have low liquidity (eg, their price moves up a lot per unit of inflow), but also have short interest and low implied volatility. I theorize this maximizes the chance that a squeeze or defensive posture by MMs happens, should a sustained inflow of capital occur. The result is, in theory, that buying inflows will lead to faster share price movements and rapid increases in IVs -- basically that options print.\n\n* **S**hort Interest: Exchange Reported: 25% float (May 28), Ortex: 22% (Jun 8).\n* **M**arket Cap: $2.14B\n* **E**xtremely Memeable: Green Giant. Crisco. Cream of Wheat.\n* **L**ow Liquidity: Avg Daily Volume: 1.18M shs ($39m), 1.8 % Market Cap, 72% inst ownership\n* **L**ow IV: \\~40%\n\nSmells good to me. I like the 72% inst. ownership, as well.\n\n## Boomer Fundamentals, Meme Price Action\n\nI didn't really see this ticker mentioned back in Jan, or during this squeeze cycle, but take a look here:\n\n[It tracks with the memes, like BBBY](https://preview.redd.it/2648ua3pu9571.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ad31751c0d6634ac6fa8745ec435b6be14a4885)\n\nIt looks like BGS likes getting groped just as much as the other memes. If/when a squeeze happens to the others, I'm betting that BGS rears its Green Giant Cock again. This is with zero catalysts -- I didn't find any [posts for BGS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=bgs+flair%3Add&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) on or around Jun 2, when it last popped. So, most likely, this pop comes from short books being stressed elsewhere. This is good.\n\n**In fact, BGS is the second highest shorted dividend stock.** First place? BBBY, which currently has an IV of 106%. Compare that to BGS's IV of 40%. Yeah, I'll be taking some LEAPs and seeing how squeeze season plays out.\n\nThe conclusion here: If meme season doesn't squeeze BGS, there's the possibility of sloppy seconds coming from growth-to-value rotation.\n\n## More notes on Short Interest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ortex Screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/1oiuwdsqu9571.jpg?width=3535&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd56d6af80bf3155b974e631682f86d73e46c570)\n\nSI Peaked in mid May (before/during earnings), and has been tapering off as:\n\n* Perhaps they fear the new CEO\n* Squeeze season comes into full swing\n\nOne of those will certainly continue, and the other is to be determined.\n\n# V. DeltaFlux (gamma/charm/vanna)\n\nLet's head over to the deltaflux tables. I like to look at the options chain of tickers to approximate if/how deltahedging is likely to have an effect.\n\n## BGS -- $32.71 (-$0.46 [-1.39%]) -- [DeltaFlux Tables Explained](https://old.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/ms7z36/deltaflux_tables_explained/)\n\n**OI as of:** Mon Jun 14 (at open) - **Date used for DTE**: Mon Jun 14, 2021 12:14 EST**Weighted Avg IV:** 50.07%, **Shares:** 64,750,000, **Float:** 63,430,000, **Avg Vol (10d):** 1,475,300\n\n|Price Point|\\# Shares DeltaHedged|\u2190 % Float|1% Price \u2206flux (sh)|\u2190 % Float / % Avg Vol|24hr \u2206flux (sh)|\u2190 % Float / % Vol|10% IV \u2206flux (sh)|\u2190 % Float / % Vol|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$22.50|\\-2,854,387|\\-4.50|54,992|0.08 / 3.73|\\-20,160|\\-0.03 / -1.37|103,286|0.16 / 7.00|\n|$25.00|\\-1,979,857|\\-3.12|107,662|0.16 / 7.30|\\-12,856|\\-0.02 / -0.87|96,675|0.15 / 6.55|\n|$27.50|\\-912,557|\\-1.44|114,528|0.18 / 7.76|\\-7,048|\\-0.01 / -0.48|80,345|0.13 / 5.45|\n|$30.00|213,233|0.34|151,636|0.24 / 10.28|\\-41,143|\\-0.06 / -2.79|82,723|0.13 / 5.61|\n|$32.50|1,621,584|2.56|195,276|0.32 / 13.24|\\-38,583|\\-0.06 / -2.62|44,557|0.07 / 3.02|\n|**c - $32.71**|1,747,885|2.76|196,734|0.32 / 13.34|\\-34,940|\\-0.06 / -2.37|38,756|0.06 / 2.63|\n|**o - $33.17**|2,023,961|3.19|198,129|0.32 / 13.43|\\-25,415|\\-0.04 / -1.72|25,103|0.04 / 1.70|\n|$35.00|3,056,114|4.82|180,296|0.30 / 12.22|19,767|0.03 / 1.34|\\-31,256|\\-0.05 / -2.12|\n|$37.50|4,112,994|6.48|123,335|0.21 / 8.36|45,680|0.07 / 3.10|\\-73,873|\\-0.12 / -5.01|\n|$40.00|4,742,784|7.48|75,261|0.13 / 5.10|25,816|0.04 / 1.75|\\-72,589|\\-0.11 / -4.92|\n|$42.50|5,111,324|8.06|48,980|0.08 / 3.32|10,683|0.02 / 0.72|\\-62,438|\\-0.10 / -4.23|\n|$45.00|5,346,477|8.43|34,374|0.06 / 2.33|5,792|0.01 / 0.39|\\-54,325|\\-0.09 / -3.68|\n|$47.50|5,505,160|8.68|24,854|0.04 / 1.68|3,779|0.01 / 0.26|\\-46,639|\\-0.07 / -3.16|\n\n## Notes\n\nIn my personal experience, gamma (1% price flux) values of &gt;0.30% float are significant, and I'm surprised to see them given that the option chain seems pretty sparse. I imagine more OI would extend this ramp significantly. It's also nice that vanna (10% IV flux) is currently positive. My read is that short term movement to $35.00 is easily possible.\n\n2.75% of float currently deltahedged is a nothing burger. It's not tying up much float, and so I don't suspect the current option chain is subtracting from liquidity -- but I think liquidity is low to begin with. Of course, if OI blows up, this number is likely to skyrocket as well.\n\nWhat's exciting to me is the % avg volume -- I'd consider &gt;4.00% to be pretty sizeable, and we're waaaay past that. If one were to believe that average volume were indicative of liquidity, then deltahedging could certainly start pushing the share price around, should it naturally move up (or down).\n\nFor reference, here are some other tickers' current peak values:\n\n|Ticker|% DeltaHedged|1% price flux % Float|1% price flux % Avg Vol|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**BGS**|2.75%|0.30%|11.43%|\n|WWE (before pop)|19.19%|0.14%|5.75%|\n|BBBY|6.74%|0.43%|4.55%|\n|CLNE|11.10%|0.26%|0.65%|\n|CLOV|28.38%|0.82%|0.27%|\n|AMC|23.75%|0.25%|0.42%|\n|GME|18.38%|0.39%|1.50%|\n\n# VI. Positions and Closing Remarks\n\nI see significant upside:\n\n* Short Term: If squeeze season is still in effect, this currently tracks with meme stocks like BBBY. This is all without any significant coverage on WSB. If near-term rotation-to-value occurs, there is likely some upside there as well.\n* Mid Term: Q2 guidance was conservative, and I believe the downside is priced in. Given that, a surprise Q2 is a major possibility. A slower rotation from growth to value would also work. BGS has a juicy dividend and is priced at a discount to its peers.\n* Long Term: New CEO started **today**. Proven track record. For the foreseeable future, BGS will be limited only by supply, and not demand. I have faith on their ability to execute -- great relationships with suppliers and competitive pricing. Can reach price commensurate with its peers.\n\nI think downside is priced in, given some analysts did some scat play with it due to supply concerns.\n\nOther things I like:\n\n* Passes the SMELL test\n* Options are dirt cheap\n* Green Giant, Crisco, Cream of Wheat\n\n## Don't YOLO, etc\n\nNone of this is financial advice. Don't go crazy with this and don't blame me if it doesn't moon. If share price or IV spike, then wait for a better entry or the next opportunity.\n\n## My positions\n\nI'm playing a little bit of everything. Yes, I have a lot of different calls, but this isn't a YOLO. It's about 5% of my options book.\n\n* 10% - Jun: $35 - Betting on miracle spike like with WWE.\n* 30% - Jul: $35, $37.50, $40 - Betting on squeeze season carrying BGS, and/or growth-to-value rotation.\n* 30% - Aug: $35, $37.50, $40 - Betting on Q2 blowout and/or growth-to-value rotation.\n* 20% - Jan: $35 - Betting long term CEO, Q2 and/or Q3 blowout. Valuation approaches that of peers.\n* 10% - Chance your wife has an STD",

        "selftext": "Good morning gamblers, \n\n**For a brief overview** - Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 300 employees from leading technology and automotive companies. [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/) Their unique selling point is a modular platform purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. This \u2018skateboard\u2019 platform is largely what drew Apple\u2019s interest. The platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car\u2019s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)\n\nCanoo is bringing its first vehicle to market next year with its electric microbus/van available at a base price of $34,750 before tax incentives or add-ons. It\u2019s now taking preorders in the United States for the \u201clifestyle\u201d vehicle, as well as for its round-top pickup truck and multi-purpose delivery van. Canoo is taking a different route than many other electric vehicle manufacturers, which played a role in the interest from Apple and Hyundai. Canoo\u2019s trio of vehicles all have the same proprietary \u201cskateboard\u201d platform architecture that houses the batteries and electric drivetrain in a chassis that sits under the vehicle\u2019s cabin. This contributes to a similar design language between the vehicles, which all have the same wide front windshield and relatively low profile. [link](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/)\n\nA quick glance at its balance sheet shows that they aren\u2019t at risk of running out of cash anytime soon. Their total assets are $717.8M (of which cash and cash equivalents are $641.9M) and total liabilities are $107.6M (of which long-term debt is $6.9M).[link](https://investors.canoo.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-21-007431/goev-20210331x10q.htm#CondensedConsolidatedBalanceSheetsinthou)\n\n**Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze?**\n\n1. **High short interest: Yes,** ~29.7% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV) \n\n2. **Low float: Yes,** total float of 99.9M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9.9% shares outstanding being held by institutions (23.7% of float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV).  \n\n3. **Decent volume (also because of the high short interest there's a medium-high short ratio): Yes,** Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest), Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV?p=GOEV&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch), marketwatch has the average at 5.59M [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goev). \n\n4. **High short ratio: Yes,** based on the volume numbers above \u2013 we\u2019re looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn\u2019t be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks. [shortsqueeze 5.3 link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&amp;submit=Short+Quote) and [Nasdaq 11.3 link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)\n\n**Additional points**\n \n1.**There\u2019s room to run** - a squeeze would not initially be setting an ATH since the stock is currently down 51.5% [link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&amp;submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) from its ATH with a market cap of $2.3 Billion. This is primarily due to an overhaul in management as well as a change in the business model which favored protecting Canoo\u2019s IP instead of providing it to other OEMs, still ended up bring the SP down short-term since it was radically different from when they went public. \n\n2.**Shorts running into a wall** - 150,000 shares are left available to borrow at a rate of 24.5%, which is 0.15% of the entire float so shorts are about to hit a wall in terms of how easy it is to manipulate the share price. [link](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/goev)\n\n3.**Possible PT** \u2013 unlike all the other information which is part data part speculation, this is **pure speculation** since we're talking about pre-revenue but I really think you could easily 10x the current share price if it\u2019s a momentum based squeeze since it's a short-term event that isn't based on technicals. Valuations based on fundamentals aren\u2019t really the same as they were a couple of years ago, and given the low interest rate / easy access to cash the question really is how high can it go? Since institutions don't hold the majority of the float (they currently only hold ~24% of the float but have increased their position by ~120% in the last month) and there should therefore theoretically be a smaller likelihood of shenanigans with lower price manipulation, this could easily 10x the current share price to $100 if more retail become aware of the company's potential and buy-in to their long-term vision, and additional institutions start buying in. Personally speaking, I like to look at market caps to see how high things can go \u2013 with GME and AMC both were hovering under a $20 Billion market cap before AMC blew open the gates a couple of weeks back. Other tickers that went up in the last week like WISH and CLOV however hit around a $10 Billion market cap before coming back down. If we use that $10B market cap to be conservative, that still gets us to almost $50, which is 5x the current share price \u2013 and since you can make a case for Canoo\u2019s short interest being higher than the previous two cases, I don\u2019t see why it couldn\u2019t reach that by the end of the month, or even within a week if shorts start to cover and bring the house down.\n\n**Upcoming catalysts**\n\n1. **Upcoming investor day this Thursday (June 17th)**, which will be a \u2018hybrid in-person and virtual journey into Canoo\u2019s product portfolio and business strategy.\u2019 [link](https://canooirday.com/)\n \n2. **Canoo is being added to the Russel 3000 index,** [link](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf) meaning that the stock along with other additions could be expected to \u2018trade more than their average daily volume in the Nasdaq Closing Cross on June 25, and some will trade an entire week\u2019s volume on \u201cRussell Friday\u201d.\u2019 [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-small-caps-should-know-about-the-russell-rebalance-2020-06-22).\n\nOn a final note, this is not financial advice so please don\u2019t treat it as such \u2013 do your own due diligence, read your own news, study their financials and evaluate multiple perspectives (bullish and bearish) to see what others are saying. Don\u2019t invest money you\u2019re not willing to lose, and do so at your own risk.\n\n**TLDR**:  Canoo is among the healthiest EV startups out there, $641.9 million in cash, only $6.9 million in long-term debt and a market cap of just $2.3 billion with a &lt;$10 share price. This is the company that Apple wanted to buy and Hyundai wanted to partner with. Other EVs have the same market cap and may not even have the cash to make it through the next 3 months so Canoo really should be trading at multiples of where it is atm. Price is trending upwards \u2013 11.8% in last week, 32.9% in last month \u2013 someone\u2019s been loading up while it\u2019s cheap (institutional ownership is up 119.2% over the last 3 months).

        "selftext": "&gt;The prices of so-called meme stocks may be distorted because the majority of trades in those names are executed away from public exchanges where share price formation occurs, the head of the New York Stock Exchange said on Wednesday.\n\n&gt;\u201cMeme stocks,\u201d which often start as low-priced, highly shorted stocks that users of online forums such as Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets rally behind, are some of the most heavily traded and volatile shares on any given day.\n\n&gt;Shares of companies like video game retailer GameStop Corp (GME.N) and theater chain operator AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) have whipsawed this year, with GameStop having rallied more than 1,600% in January alone, prompting trading halts by some brokers and sparking Congressional and regulatory hearings.\n\n&gt;\"In some of the meme stocks that we've seen, or stocks that have a high level of retail participation, the vast majority of order flow can trade off of exchanges, which is problematic,\" said Stacey Cunningham, president of Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (ICE.N) NYSE.\n\n&gt;\"That price formation is not really reflective of what supply and demand is,\" she said at a conference hosted by CNBC.\n\n&gt;Retail trading surged during the coronavirus pandemic, helped by a shift by retail brokerages to commission-free trading, with individual traders now responsible for around 35% of market volume, up from 20% pre-pandemic.\n\n&gt;In meme stocks, individual traders contribute as much as 70% of the volume, Cunningham said.\n\n&gt;The majority of retail orders bypass exchanges because of an arrangement called payment for order flow, in which retail brokerages sell their customers' marketable orders to wholesale brokers. The wholesalers match the orders internally, trying to profit off of the bid-ask spread, while offering retail traders the best market price or better.\n\n&gt;Retail brokers say payment for order flow lowers overall costs for individual traders.\n\n&gt;But the practice raises conflict of interest questions and will be included in a broad review of stock market rules, Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said last week.\n\n&gt;The review will also examine whether off-exchange trading - which is about 50% of the market when institutional block trades are included - distorts the price discovery mechanism for stocks, Gensler said.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/meme-stock-prices-may-not-properly-reflect-demand-nyse-president-2021-06-16/",

        "selftext": "I'll start with the usual: I am not a financial advisor.  I do not provide financial advice! Everything following this is opinion/observation.  Much of my knowledge of the markets has been acquired through reading countless hours of DD posted by others.\n\nOBLIGATORY - BuY &amp; HoDl!\n\nNow that that is out of the way, I would like to reference a few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point.  The below have DD's that are a must read if you have not already; please visit their profiles and read their posts.  I will attempt to summarize the main points briefly below.\n\nu/Criand:\n\n[1)]**The flurry of rules before the storm. GME might be hitting T+35 and T+21 next week**\n\n[2)]**Things are shockingly similar to the February 24th and March 10th runup**\n\nu/myplayprofile - I am highlighting just one of their posts, but it goes into linear correlation which is now shifting to logarithmic correlation between GME &amp; AMC prices.  AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their GME losses.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis post is focused on u/Criand's DD, which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day / 31 day FTD cycles.\n\nBasically his DD over the last few weeks is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles, and one of his most recent posts shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days.\n\nKey Points:\n\n* He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T+21 day FTD cycles, which have been shown to cause price surges, do not act the same way as they did during the $480 run and the $350 run.\n* Explains how the Feb-March $350 run was caused by a dual event of T+35 &amp; T+21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another (back to back trading days)\n* Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to $350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at $350\n* He references u/yelyah2 DD, which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the $480 and $350 price run ups, returns to normal for about a week, and then spikes up massively again, initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes\n\nBelow is my furtherment of u/Criand's work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now.  Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD's before.\n\nPlease click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don't eat... EVER.\n\n[Transparent boxes represent the initiation of the combined T+35 \\/ T+21 day price movements + 6 days \\(because it has only been 6 trading days since ](https://preview.redd.it/v8tmo6hdi5371.png?width=1287&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a7e70813852641f29b2e57d8fc64ea7f7b83f77)\n\nNotes:\n\n* I am not sure why I called the $480 and $350 price run ups in the visual \"Micro Squeezes\", but thats what came to mind.  Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u/yelyah2 recent DD?\n* Yellow is micro squeeze 1\n* Blue is micro squeeze 2\n* Pink is the past 6 days\n\nAlright folks.  I have talked a lot about other peoples work, and given you a graphic.  Now comes my value add.\n\nKey observations:\n\n* Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to $350 on March 10th, but it was also **EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS** between the January 13th initiation to the $480 peak on January 29th.  My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T+35/T+21 day price movements, and helps us further establish that we could potentially go **PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5/25 on JUNE 9th.**  Will they be able to stop us this time?  Maybe it doesn't even matter if the do... See my next points\n* In the aftermath of the January \"micro squeeze\" the Dec-Jan price floor of \\~$20 **DOUBLED**, and the new price floor was set at \\~$40 between Feb 5th - 25th.     In the aftermath of the Feb 24th - Mar 10th \"micro squeeze\" the price floor of \\~$40 **TRIPLED**, and the new price floor was set at \\~$120 between Feb 5-25.  Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events, **could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?** (That would be a price floor of $360+ for those of you who needed help there)\n* Edit to previous bullet: someone makes a fair point that \"We can\u2019t assume that since it doubled in January from $20 to $40 and tripled in March from $40 to $120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x $120. What if the rule in the sequence is +20-&gt;+80-&gt;+140? Or what if +20-&gt;+80-&gt;+20-&gt;+80?\"  I have included this just to explicitly state that my question **\"could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?\"** by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again.  I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more.\n* The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers (golden cross) 3 times this year.\n   * Event 1, Yellow ($480 run)\n   * Event 2, Blue ($350 run)\n   * Event 3, Pink (May 17th - today)\n\nAdditionally, I have plotted trend lines for each of the events.\n\n* Event 1 (Yellow) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1,733%\n* Event 2 (Blue) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770%.\n* 770 / 1733 = 44% or a 56% reduction in 10 day price increase, although the price was starting from a floor of $40 instead of $20.\n* 44% of 770% would be 338% starting from $120 which would mean a peak price of \\~$405 in event 3, **IF** this short pattern continues exactly the same.\n* THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME.\n* I am only observing the trend of the current pattern.  The sample size here is literally 2 events, albeit 2 very unlikely \"coincidental\" events.  And I don't believe in coincidence.\n* The pattern will break for many reasons, but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever.\n* Once they get margin called its off to the races, and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back (Kenny G, you are the camel)\n\nOh yeah... forgot about this one.  LOOK AT THE VOLUME.  ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE.  MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC, KOSS, ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM $132 (April 13th) TO $290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION.  WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY!\n\nAlright guys.  To summarize.  We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above.  The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck.\n\n**This is not my original post**",

        "selftext": "I recently commented on a post about GME that I sell covered calls (henceforth CCs) on meme stocks. The reception to the comment was poor \u2013 35 downvotes and counting. Upon reviewing responses to my comment, I realized that many people have a fundamental misunderstanding of CCs. I hope to clear some of those up and introduce in what may be a new strategy to those who read this.\n\n**What does it mean to sell covered calls?**\n\nTo sell a covered call means to buy 100 shares of a stock and then sell a call option against the shares. When you sell the call, you collect a premium upfront. If the underlying stock is above the strike price on the expiry date, you will get assigned. Since you are \u201ccovered\u201d and own 100 shares of the underlying, you can deliver your shares to the holder of the call to satisfy your obligation. If the stock is below the strike price on the expiry date, you get to keep the shares. In either situation, the premium is yours to keep.\n\nThis strategy is different than selling a naked call option (i.e., selling a call without owning the underlying). In that strategy, you lose $1 for every cent the stock is above the strike price at expiry. With CCs, you own 100 shares of the stock, so those 100 shares were also able to make $1 for every cent in price appreciation. In essence, with CCs you are selling the upside above the strike price to the long of the trade.\n\n**Three strategies compared under four scenarios**\n\nThe best way to demonstrate why I believe this strategy is so valuable is to compare trading outcomes under four strategies \u2013 selling covered calls, owning 100 shares outright, and owning a call option.\n\nFor this example, I will use AMC shares which last traded at $54.23 and a 55 strike July 2 expiry call which last traded at $4.25. This example is for AMC, but this can be done with any stock if you substitute the applicable pricing.\n\nIf this is too much reading, I\u2019ve summarized what I believe is the best trading strategy in each price band within the chart below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8c622ynpkw771.png?width=2604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8793805dbc8f0b621940bc7dc42bf1cb4d1b3640\n\n*Scenario 1 \u2013 AMC goes down (Winner: tie between selling covered calls and owning a call)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares will lose money; however, because you collected a premium, you are still ahead if AMC finishes above $49.98 ($54.23-$4.25). Even if AMC finishes below $49.98, you can \u201croll\u201d your option to a different expiry and collect more premium.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will lose money.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes out of the money and your loss is the premium paid of $425. I am giving this one a tie because if the stock tanks, the call has a 100% loss but in dollar terms the loss is limited. So in a sense the winner depends on how much the stock falls and if you believe the stock will recover in the future.\n\n*Scenario 2 \u2013 AMC stays at $54.23 (Winner: selling covered calls)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares neither make nor lose money; however, you profit the premium received of $425. Since $54.23 is below the strike of $55, you can roll the option to a different expiry and collect more premium.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares neither make nor lose money.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes out of the money and your loss is the premium paid of $425.\n\n*Scenario 3 \u2013 AMC finishes in the range of $55-$59.25 (Winner: tie between selling covered calls and owning 100 shares outright)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: The shares participate in the upside up until $55. This would mean a $77 profit on the shares (\\[$55-$54.23\\] x 100). You would also keep the premium of $425 which brings the total profit to $502. You would lose the shares as the stock finished above $55.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will gain money. Your profit would be the difference in the finishing price and $54.23, all multiplied by $100. So, if AMC finishes at $59.25, the profit would be $502 (\\[$59.25-$54.23\\] x 100).\n* Owning a call: The call finishes in the money; however, since you had to pay a premium, that must be subtracted from the gain. If the stock finishes at $59.25, you would breakeven (\\[$59.25-$55-$4.25\\] x 100).\n\n*Scenario 4 \u2013 AMC finishes above $59.68 (Winner: owning a call)*\n\n* Selling covered calls: Same as scenario 3. The profit is $502 and you lose your shares.\n* Owning 100 shares outright: The shares will gain money. Your profit would be the difference in the finishing price and $54.23, all multiplied by $100. If the stock finishes at $59.68, your profit would be $545.\n* Owning a call: The call finishes in the money; however, since you had to pay a premium, that must be subtracted from the gain. If the stock finishes at $59.68, your profit would be $42.69 (\\[$59.68-$55-$4.25\\] x 100). As a percentage of the original investment, this strategy has a higher ROI than owning 100 shares outright for stock prices above $59.68.\n\nThere are a few gaps in these scenarios, but the point should be clear by now. Selling covered calls is profitable in scenarios 2-4 and in scenario 1 if the stock is above $49.98. Owning 100 shares is profitable in scenarios 3 and 4 while owning a call was profitable in only scenario 4.\n\nThis is why I love selling covered calls \u2013 it is profitable in more market conditions than the other trading strategies. It will outperform other strategies unless the underlying stock makes a large move to the upside.\n\n**Misconceptions**\n\nI came across a few misconceptions in responses to my comment. Here are a few of them.\n\n*You can\u2019t make money on CCs if the stock goes up.* \u2013 Absolutely you would. If the stock goes up, you get to keep the premium. Only in selling a naked call would you not make money in this situation.\n\n*You shouldn\u2019t sell CCs on a high IV stock.* \u2013 Assuming you're bullish on the stock, high IV stocks are the best to target as you can collect more premium. This point is only correct if you anticipate a large downward move in the stock that would lose more than the premium received.\n\n*You should sell puts instead of CCs if you\u2019re bullish on the stock.* \u2013 There\u2019s some nuance to this, but this point is mostly incorrect. Due to something called put-call parity, selling a put is conceptually nearly identical to selling a covered call.\n\n**Downsides:**\n\nThere are a few downsides to CCs which you should consider before trading.\n\n*Funds required* \u2013 Selling covered calls requires owning 100 shares of the stock. This is capital intensive. Consider buying 100 shares of GME which would cost $20,800. Buying a GME July 2 expiry call with 0.71 delta (meaning you get price appreciation that replicates owning 71 shares) only costs about $2,443.\n\n*Stock tanks and never recovers* \u2013 If the stock tanks and never recovers, you won\u2019t be able to recoup your losses; however, even if this happens, your outcome is better than the other strategies from before since you got to keep the premium.\n\n*The upside is limited* \u2013 Your upside is capped at the strike price. If there\u2019s a strong movement upwards, the other strategies are better; however, there may be situations where you call \u201croll\u201d your option up in strike and out in expiry. This may allow you to keep stock.\n\nConclusion: Selling covered calls are an underrated trading strategy that is often misunderstood. It is profitable in a wide range of trading environments. Sure it may not be as \"sexy\" as buying FDs and it won't get you rich overnight, but it can possibly provide strong and consistent returns over time.",

        "selftext": "Workhorse Group (WKHS) As of today, it is shorted at nearly 42% of float. This seems to me to be the next runner from AMC and GME. \n\nBoth GME and AMC were hugely shorted previously when the rallies started, and now that short interest has decreased. It still is there but has decreased and that's why I think we've seen momentum change.\n\nToday, AMC took a massive hit due to the company offering nearly 12 million stocks for purchase which hurt many peoples wins and likely some that hasn't invested sooner. \n\nI expect GME and AMC will likely both continue to increase if stocks are held. But based on short interest alone, it would seem to me that WKHS is next in line for the biggest squeeze meaning it has the biggest short term gains to be had.\n\nWKHS was trading for around $10-$11 yesterday and is nearly $15/share currently.\n\nThoughts?",

        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. \n\nOverall, it has been an amazing week for investors in general and all the top growing stocks that [I shared here last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) have ended in green with an average return of 11.7%. So, without further ado, let's dive into this week\u2019s list! \n\n **Most Discussed Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/per8x892fn371.png?width=1039&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d457b0954852cb8d3abacf10341d7dadd99e3d3\n\nBoth AMC and BB individually generated more discussion than the other 8 put together! This can be attributed to the possibility of the next squeeze and also the rallying stock price. Weed stocks also made a double entry into the top 10 list with SNDL coming in 4th and TLRY 5th (we will discuss why in the next section). Investors were most bullish about Tilray and Nokia\u2019s prospects as reflected by the sentiment! Another interesting observation is that it has been a rough week for Tesla with it being the only stock in the list that ended in the red.\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ov3zes4cfn371.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca5d580ccfea58c5659a40b50afec8b78da53666\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Almost all the stocks increased in chatter due to the rally of meme stocks and not due to any fundamental news\n\n**BlackBerry($BB):** No points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. BlackBerry was also present in the [last week\u2019s list](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) and the stock has been running up almost 80% in the last six weeks. The discussions were predominantly driven around whether BB would be the next short squeeze play. Even though the company has made some significant strides over the last year (Collaboration with AWS being an example), there are no specific news that\u2019s driving the current rally.\n\n**Clean Energy Fuels($CLNE):** There isn\u2019t any new fundamental news out of the company for the current rally but the discussion exploded in Reddit and the stock gained as much as 20% on Thursday. The stock experienced a quadrupling of the average daily volume as Reddit investors piled on to the stock. The company is still trading at a healthy 17.6% increase over last week\u2019s closing price.\n\n**Workhorse Group($WKHS):** Even though the company did not have a good month in May with them disappointing the investors with their first-quarter results (the company only delivered six electric cargo trucks). But the shares of the company have rocketed more than 40% in June. The discussion volume as well as the trading volume has been on a consistent rise over the past week. \u00a0\n\n**Nokia($NOK):** Nokia\u2019s current rally is primarily driven by optimism over its back-to-back 5G network deployment wins with multiple telecom operators such as Net4Mobility, DITO Telecommunity Corporation, T-Mobile, and Optus. The company has also resolved a long-drawn patent licensing dispute with Daimler and has been strengthening its financials by generating strong cash flows. Investor sentiment has also been extremely bullish as we can see from the trends.\n\n**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** Weed stocks are mainly moving due to a mix of fundamental news and retail trading interest. SNDL rose almost 30% this week before dropping down. The marijuana industry is consolidating and a spate of deals were announced this week. Adding to this, there has been progress in legalization efforts in the US. Tilray(TLRY) has also been on the run with the stock price increasing 12% and the chatter growing by 300% this week.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:** AMC Entertainment($AMC) chatter grew by 189% (which is massive considering that the stock was already the [most discussed stock last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/)) and Clover Health ($CLOV) discussions increased by 255% but were not high enough to make the top 5 list.\n\nThank you for reading! \n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "selftext": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nI\u2019m extremely bullish on AMC. In fact, more than I was back in late January and early February. The inflation rate, collateral issues, and reverse repos are all factors that lead me to believe that investors are inching ever so closer to creating heavy losses for hedge funds and short sellers. As you may be aware, during the AMC shareholder count that occurred on June 2nd, CEO Adam Aaron stated retail investors comprise 80% of AMC shares with each individual averaging about 120 shares each. As of 9am EST this Wednesday morning, AMC has seen 1.76 million trades, and despite no new huge news, it\u2019s already seeing a gradual decrease from yesterday\u2019s close. So why are so many people selling? That\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t think we are. Earlier this morning, Jim Cramer commented on AMC\u2019s price action in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1405138423741100033):\n\n\u201cMeme people AMC is down\u2026. I think it\u2019s time to burst in.\u201d Now this is entirely speculation on my part, but I believe that this could be serving as a cover for a short ladder attack, which is something that many GME, AMC, and other tickers are familiar with. That being said, I do expect the rest of today and this trading week to be rather ugly. However, no one said that a ride to the moon would be a smooth one. In the past 5 months alone, retail investors have caused billions of dollars worth of losses to hedge funds and overall people that want to screw over working class people. In fact, this past Monday (the 14th), when AMC surged 15%, it caused over $515 million worth of losses. This is chump change compared to some of the other numbers we\u2019ve seen, but they add up. Another interesting piece of information I learned is that recent reports showed that AMC is the most traded stock on Fidelity and Freetrade, and the 3rd most traded stock on Robinhood. Just take look below.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1agt5p2p0n571.png?width=1495&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2ca6fcbd7807333102d8674635b8851cb175d979\n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykdc6hmq0n571.jpg?width=1408&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1d81f7f5ca89f3b3ed5b7b8c4c342a03a068ddbd\n\nI personally dislike the Motely Fool, but it allowed me to view information provided by Robinhood. As you can see, sentiment for AMC remains high across multiple brokerages.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ji7s761s0n571.png?width=1940&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d5937d5adab17070ada855f0ec8beb31a600bf8\n\nAs of June 2nd, AMC has managed to remain above $42.72 and this has continued for two whole weeks! This has resulted in devastating losses for short sellers. It went as far as touching $70 just two weeks ago. And although it is currently in the mid-50\u2019s range, I believe that bullish sentiment from traders will allow it to continue to climb even in the face of short ladder attacks. According to the data on Webull, AMC has seen more large-scale orders recently. This might be due to the amount of options expiring this Friday, the 18th. Down below, I\u2019ve listed the large-scale buy orders placed and executed in the last 5 trading days:\n\n6/09: $1,829,580\n\n6/10: $4,826,810\n\n6/11: $6,961,840\n\n6/14: $5,458,670\n\n6/15: $9,946,860\n\nMind you, this is the net value of all large-scale orders that were placed those days. In other words, it took the difference from all the large-scale buys as well as the large-scale sells. The final numbers for all of those dates came out to a positive number, meaning there were more buys than sells. That doesn\u2019t even take into account people buying from RH, Etrade, Fidelity, etc. Needless to say, buying pressure is immense right now, which may the reason there has been an increase of FUD, shills, and bots trying to direct people away from AMC and into other tickers and ultimately tricking them into losing their money into a pump and dump.\n\nIn terms of good news, AMC is currently poised to become the dominant movie theatre chain in L.A., which would include two shopping mall locations. With both tourists and locals visiting during the summer, and with more and more Americans receiving the vaccine and the desire to return to normal coming along with it, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see significant increases in revenue as time goes on. This change might not be an immediate one, of course, but it does force investors to consider the long-term plays that come with it.\n\nShort sellers can\u2019t hold forever, but investors can. Short interest will slowly eat away at them and one day, as we all know, they\u2019ll be forced to cover. When this happens, it\u2019ll be every man for himself. Seeing as to how many of us control the stock, though, we could, in theory, just not sell, which would cause an unprecedented rise in stock price. It should be common sense by now that we know that this cannot be accomplished by a single individual, hence the phrase: \u201cApes together strong.\u201d \ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nTL;DR I feel as though bitch boy Cramer and his ass-kissing gay bear friends are working extra hard to get people to paper-hand. He wants our bananas, but I refuse to give it to him. I think there are plenty of catalysts that not only make the current price sustainable, but on the verge of further increasing. As always, I\u2019m not a financial advisor. Do your own research before making any investment decisions. I just like the stock. AMC to the moon, my friends \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15",

        "selftext": "**OK APES IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING START TO THE SUMMER ALREADY AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET EVEN MORE INTERESTING**\n\n\nAll our favorite stocks in GME, AMC, BB, CLNE, CLOV, WKHS are spiking and it's a retard's dream come true.  Only problem is that we seem to be a bit scattered currently with almost 7 different tickers being mentioned over and over again.  Let's get straight to the point, we want to make money.  (By the way I'm not a financial advisor and anyone that takes advice from me is probably retarded).  Out of all the meme stocks, one stands out the most to me just because of fundamentals alone:\n\n\n\n**CLNE.**\n\n\n\nNow don't get me wrong, there's another certain stock that has to do with videogames which is shorted to oblivion and hedgies are absolutely fucked.  But we're talking about Mr. Clean right now.  \n\n\n\n**How can this cow fart meme stock make me money you ask?** \n\n\n\nWell, it's the only one with the government on our side.  Mr. Biden is all about going green in the future and what better feel good story than turning cow fart into a natural gas that powers our vehicles?  This crazy company actually devised a way to transition their product from traditional CNG or LNG to something they call \"Renewable Natural Gas\" (RNG).  \n\n\n\n**So how the fuck are they doing this??**\n\n\n\nLet me explain.  The landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, ranches etc. create methane. They use some of it to power their facilities, but then are left with a fuck ton of leftover methane which, until CLNE came around, they would just burn off into the environment at a GWP of 30. And that's not a good number for us.  But our hero and savior CLNE takes the methane that's captured it and processes it into RNG, which they then transport to filling stations and use to fill up heavy transport vehicles. Those vehicles emit 1.1 GWP carbon, making them, technically, carbon negative.  And who eats this shit up??  Amazon.  Amazon recently created a pilot program by which they are buying 1,000 RNG powered vehicles for their fleet. CLNE did something brilliant a few years ago to put themselves in the position to be the ones who fuel these machines by building their refilling stations right next to Amazon's warehouses.  Not only that but Amazon will be buying 53 million shares at a strike price of $13.49 by the end of the decade from CLNE.  \n\n\n[Source](https://investors.cleanenergyfuels.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clean-energy-signs-agreement-amazon-low-and-negative-carbon-rng)  \n\n\n\n**Price**\n\n\n\nThe stock is currently trading around $10 because IB wants to keep it under $13 for the time being.  I'm sure you guys have read the gamma squeeze potential coming up on 6/18 so I'm not going to go too deep into that.  Basically if $CLNE hits $13 by June 18th, over 1.86 million shares become in the money for calls. And another 400,000 shares at 12, and 280,000 at 11, and 390,000 at 10.  The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Clean Energy Fuels Corp have a median target of 20.00, with a high estimate of 27.00 and a low estimate of 11.00  \n\n\n[Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=CLNE)\n\n\n\nIt's a company that's easily worth at least double what it's trading at right now but because of the small float it's pretty easy to manipulate.  The IB's are fighting like hell to keep the price at 12.99 or lower which can be seen even in last week's last trading days where out of the total volume on Friday, 32% have have been sold short and it's an increase from Thursday where only 8% of the volume was sold short.  That kept that spike from $9 to $11 from getting out of control for them.  \n\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f](https://preview.redd.it/0w3ny5m0dw271.jpg?width=714&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f)\n\n\n\n**The Play?**\n\n\n\nShares.  The small float means that shares can increase the price substantially causing IV to get bigger and makes the setup for the gamma squeeze that much more likely.  And even if you don't play the squeeze at all, this company is still a no brainer in terms of being undervalued currently and I predict to be $20+ by EOY.  \n\n\n\n**TL;DR:**  Cow farts go BRRRRRRR.  Super undervalued company that has great potential in the future and actually has the fundamentals to support it.  \n\n\n\n**Positions:** \n\n10x 13C 6/18\n\n100 shares @ 8.73",

        "selftext": "&gt; (Bloomberg) -- Wall Street\u2019s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders\u2019 most-popular meme stocks.\n\n&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. are among firms that have adjusted their risk controls at prime-brokerage operations, according to people familiar with the moves. The banks are trying to protect themselves against fallout from extreme surges and dips that have characterized trading in companies including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., M***oV****n Inc. and GameStop Corp.\n\n&gt; The changes mean some hedge funds and other institutional investors now face higher collateral requirements or are limited from shorting certain stocks, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing internal policy decisions.\n\n&gt; \u201cUntil further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options\u201d in GameStop, AMC and M***oV****n, the firm said in a memo to clients seen by Bloomberg News. Naked options allow investors to short a stock without owning the underlying securities. Jefferies, which told clients that other stocks may be added to the list, will also no longer permit short sales of those securities.\n\n&gt; Representatives of Goldman, Bank of America,Citigroup and Jefferies declined to comment. It\u2019s not unusual for banks to adjust their risk controls as market conditions change.\n\n&gt; The measures may change the fortunes of retail investors lighting up Reddit message boards with their forays into day trading. Increased margin requirements could hasten the short squeezes small investors have been rushing to capitalize on. On the other hand, if hedge funds pull back on short bets due to the new restrictions, the Reddit crowd won\u2019t have as many opportunities to chase short squeezes.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-banks-rein-hedge-190856404.html",

        "selftext": "Alright apes so here is the deal. I wanted to play nice, I wanted everyone to win those big juicy tendies, no matter how they get them, but I heard something in the Jim Crammer interviews with UWMC CEO  that stuck with me and is preposterous. It was not even the $5,000 penalty ultimatum $UWMC imposed if any of their mortgage brokers does business with $RKT  (which was a dick move to begin with more on that later) but rather the CEO's answer when he was asked in the second interview \"how he is going to take on $RKT to become the top mortgage lender by 2024\" . Mat's answer was \"$RKT revenue is going to decrease on ours is going to increase because $RKT will lose money as interest rates go up because their business is 94% refinance\" here are my two reasons why this is not a winning strategy or accurate guidance from the CEO:\n\n1. Let's start with this dumb $5,000 penalty ultimatum. Mat Ishbia UWMC CEO is trying to \"protect the broker channel\" by encouraging consumers looking for a loan or refinance to always go through a broker as opposed to going on an app like \"Rocket Mortgage\" which cuts out the middle man broker (link to interview below). Mat's argument is if you are a mortgage broker and partner with $RKT is they are undermining the broker because they are taking business away from the broker by going direct to consumer on the Rocket Mortgage app. While on the surface this looks like a valent effort to protect the hard earned market of mortgage brokers it is ill advised and actually hurting brokers financially. UWMC fantasizing that this would change consumer behavior but it will not. Consumers who want to get their mortgage direct through an app are not the same consumers that are likely to get their mortgage through a broker. To relate this to a different industry lets use accounting (since I'm in this space). There are certain people who will want to file their own taxes and not deal with an accountant for reasons like: it's cheaper, they don't want people knowing their business, ect. Then their are consumers who will only use an accountant for reasons like: they like relying on a professional or they do not have time to their taxes themselves. You can think of Intuit turbo tax as the company in this example. For whatever the reason may be consumers have varying reasons for their behavior and I argue in the case of getting a mortgage or refinance it's almost two different groups of consumers. One that prefers a broker and the other that prefers to do it themselves through an app. This being said this only hurts mortgage brokers in the end because they cannot process any leads through $RKT hurting the people Mat Ishbia is claiming to protect. Lastly $RKT can win the battle on the mortgage broker end, they have the ability to drop their fees charged through a broker to entice more brokers to exclusively work with them. If UWMC continues to play this game in the race to the bottom RKT will beat them at their own game and eventually lead to UWMC removing the $5k penalty. $RKT already lowered their rates to crush them and they are still guiding in their Q1 estimates a higher gain on margin than $UWMC\n\n[Interview where the $5,000 penalty ultimatum is said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/uwm-ceo-says-fight-with-quicken-loans-is-paying-off.html)\n\n2) Getting back to the statement that the CEO believes $RKT revenue is going to decrease and UWMC is going to increase for them to be the top mortgage lender by 2024 is more ill advised fantasy guidance (link to interview below). Personally I think AMC has a better chance of hitting $10,000 before $UWMC is beating $RKT.  The likelihood of UWMC doubling revenue and RKT revenue decreasing by 50% is very very unlikely as alluded too in the clip. The $UWMC CEO also fails to recognize $RKT has already won the industry and they are moving on to take over other sectors that are growing at triple % rates\n\n* Rocket Homes is going to take on Zillow eventually with a one stop shop of buying a home with your pre approved mortgage all built into one app\n* Rocket Autos is going to launch in an app and they are going to be competing against Carvana with the advantage of having your financing all built within the app so you have a one stop shop for searching for the car and setting up your monthly payment\n* Amrock title insurance services, property valuation and settlement service is growing at the highest level of closing history per their Q1 release\n* See the news article below. $RKT also hedges against the price of rates rising from their purchase of government backed mortgages and is now selling them for a profit [Mortgage companies are making money off your forbearance plan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-companies-are-making-money-off-your-forbearance-plan-11623835802)\n* $RTK is still sitting on a share buy back program that they have yet to start where as UWMC has momentum and a buy back program occurring right now and it has still yet to pop off. \n\nWith all of these new and fast growing revenue streams, and one industry already dominated, $RKT is the way, short and long term. Not to mention they have a massive advertising campaign and they're trying to crush $UWMC out of their own price war so $RKT could be extremely profitable if they wanted to be, but they don't right now. Right now they want to dominate all these sectors first, like Amazon did early on, and then turn on the profit tendie machine at a later date and watch the earnings roll in.\n\n[Interview where UWMC saying it will be top mortgage lender by 2024 b/c $RKT revenue will decrease](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/06/11/united-wholesale-mortgage-ceo-on-goal-to-be-top-mortgage-lender-by-2024.html)\n\nI want to conclude with the fact that I love this sub and the ability of this group of apes on line at Wendy's to fundamentally change the way the boomers view stonks. I watch CNBC constantly and it's amazing how they just dismiss WSB as a bunch of retards. While this may be true, the truth is no-one knows wtf they are doing in the market, not even these hedge funds. The truth is you all do some great DD on different stocks with very intelligent points. I'm happy to be in a place where we can write about our deep understanding of technical and fundamental analysis while also getting shit on in the comments like it's an MW2 chat lobby",
