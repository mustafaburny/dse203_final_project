        "selftext": "DoorDash is currently sitting at $142 per share, down 22% from $182 when retail investors were able to buy at IPO. Only \\~10% of its 286M outstanding shares are available to trade due to its lockup period, giving it a float of 20M shares.\n\nHere's where things get interesting. If you take a look at page 91 of their S-1 filing ([Go to page 91 to confirm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm#rom752207_9) ), existing shareholders PRE-IPO purchased 284M shares at $8.73. Company employees who purchased shares at that price are salivating at a current 1,628% profit. Early lockup period expires 90 days after IPO, meaning that 90% of outstanding shares (284M shares once again) that currently can't be traded and were purchased at $8.73 will be released into the market available to trade. Regardless of what you think about valuation and possible future growth of DoorDash (which is already ridiculously overpriced and they had the worst IPO in history), any rational employee will dump their holdings immediately for that 10 bagger profit.\n\nNow considering present conditions, the price action is ridiculous. Looking at the level 2 data, there is almost no retail volume, and any trades made throughout the day are by MMs trying to keep this stock liquid. Volume from the past 2 days has already dropped by 50%. Literally NO ONE wants to buy this POS. The price is pinned at $140, with retail dips that are immediately bought up by manipulation. If you look at the 1 minute chart yesterday, it traded at literally $140 throughout the day and suddenly spiked to 146 in a manner of 3 minutes before slowly settling down to $142. This thing is manipulated as fuck, and as soon as MMs are exhausted it will crash regardless of the aforementioned S-1 filing.\n\nI have 175 contracts of 5/21 $80 puts. I'm betting $87k I can look back at this post in 5 months and pretend I'm reenacting The Big Short as Ryan Gosling. More than likely, I'll probably have to start driving for DoorDash and moonlight sucking weens behind the restaurants I just made a delivery from.\n\nLooking for any serious counterarguments on why this play might be retarded.",

        "selftext": "**Background**\n\nCD PROJEKT S.A. (WSE: CDR) is a Polish video game developer, publisher and distributor based in Warsaw. CD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series and the recent release of Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nThe CD PROJEKT Group currently conducts operating activities in two key segments: CD PROJEKT RED and GOG.com (originally as Good Old Games).\n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nCD PROJEKT Capital Group is headed by CD PROJEKT S.A. A holding company which has five subsidiaries.\n\nThe subsidiaries are:\n\n\\- GOG sp. z o.o (Similar to Steam, it is a distributor of games).\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Inc (Where all the game development happens)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Co. Ltd (Only for selling games in China)\n\n\\- Spokko sp. z o.o. (The mobile arm of CD projekt red)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT RED STORE sp. z o.o. (A new store of merchandise launched by the company)\n\n**GOG -** Who have just released a 2.0 version called GOG Galaxy which subsequently entered its beta testing phase. The goal of the application is to enable players to integrate all their game shelves into a single library, to communicate with friends and to track their progress regardless of their preferred gaming platforms. Its functionality will span PC and console platforms, extending beyond the GOG.com user base. It's main selling points are that is uses the cloud, is DRM free and has a ton of old games such as Diablo, Destroy all humans etc on it's platform that Steam doesn't.\n\nSteam is the single biggest distributor of digital games for PC, it's been dominating the market for years and has way more games than GOG does due to this. Especially as a lot of publishers do not want to host their games DRM free which GOG requires. It's very difficult to predict the future of GOG because Steam is a private company so we don't have access to it's numbers.\n\nHowever the big benefit of GOG is that CD Projekt Red can sell and promote it's games directly through their own platform. The benefit being a much bigger margin on each game sold as 100% of the profit goes to CD Projekt red if a game is sold on GOG, whereas on Steam they take a 20% cut for the first $50m revenue of Cyberpunk. **One third** of all digital PC preorders for Cyberpunk 2077 sales were on GOG which is an incredible achievement by CD Projekt Red considering Steams dominance.\n\nThis is probably the reason why CD Projekt Red has such a huge operating margin from 30% to 50% in recent years. They are involved in the entire process of making and selling their games.\n\n***GWENT: The Witcher Card Game*** is the first multiplayer game developed by the CD PROJEKT Group. It has been a hugely successful and highly rated game (which is impressive considering it's their first mobile multiplayer game). The reason why this game is important for the future is because multiplayer is the key to the cash machine which is microtransactions which the card game has.\n\n**Cyberpunk** was released recently and had been in development for many years. It's sold very well but less than analysts expectations and there has been serious problems on console versions which led to sony removing cyberpunk 2077 from it's PS store for the time being. This caused the companies stock to plummet 37% recently.\n\nI'll get into the numbers at the bottom for my reverse DCF that I did.\n\n**Cyberpunk Online** multiplayer will definitely come at some point within the next couple of years. The reason being is that after GTA Onlines unbelievable success and constant revenue generation for Take Two then it makes sense to try and replicate this with Cyberpunk. This multiplayer will feature microtransactions and in my opinion is the way Cd Projekt red can really make the big $$ in the future. Microtransactions for cosmetic items like in game skins or packs (like fifa) are easy to implement and have huge operating margins as they take 0 CAPEX and virtually no time to implement due to being some simple code and designs. Here's a quote taken from their 2019 Annual Report for *Key Sources Of Revenue*:\n\n&gt;\u25a0 sales carried out through optional microtransactions in GWENT: The Witcher Card Game (incl. kegs and meteorite dust) via GOG, proprietors of console platforms (PlayStation, Xbox) and App Store (Apple)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are some huge risks with cd projekt red, here are the main ones:\n\n\\- Neither IP, The Wither or Cyberpunk 2077 is owned by CD Projekt since the two series are based on a series of novels and a tabletop RPG respectively. So they would need permission from these license holders (the creators I think) to be able to do other spin offs for them. While it is likely the permission will be given due to the huge successes it's not a certainty.\n\n\\- CD Projekt Red relies on a couple of block busters to make 80% of their revenue and earnings. The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the only revenue generates the company has (apart from GOG). If CD Projekt red messes up either of these huge IP's in the future (or like they just have with the console versions of Cyberpunk) then you can expect a huge and sudden stock price drop and potential damage to the company.\n\n\\- Because of the few but huge releases, CD Projekt Red has very volatile earnings and revenue making it very hard to predict, similar to Take Two Interactive. You can see in the following picture how sales drop a lot after release.\n\n**Co-Founders and Board History**\n\nCD PROJEKT has a very long tenure of the management board, all at least 10 years and 3/5 of them 20+ years. Insiders have a significant stake in CD Projekt red's stock, including the joint CEO's. This is great news for shareholders as the insiders have a big incentive to make the company work as they have big stakes in the company.\n\nCompany shareholding structure is made up of the following people:\n\n\\- **Marcin Iwinski** (Joint CEO &amp; Co-Founder) is **13%**\n\n\\- **Michal Kicinski** (Ex Joint CEO &amp; Co-Founder) is **11%**\n\n\\- **Piotr Nielubowicz** (VP, CFO) is **6%**\n\n\\- **Adam Kicinski** (President &amp; Joint CEO) is **3%**\n\nIncentives for management:\n\n&gt;Management goals are based 80% on net earnings and 20% on SP over the WIG index.\n\nThese are poor goals in my opinion. Net earnings can be enhanced by poor acquisitions and stock price is meaningless and should be ignored in incentives as it can produce short term motivations.\n\nManagement hit the majority of their goals for year 2019.Their goals going forward:\n\n&gt;Goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 8,300 PLN or 1,660 PLN a year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Optimistic goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 10,000 PLN or 2,000 PLN a year.\n\nThese goals seem too high in my opinion. Especially after their cyberpunk flop on consoles but it's still possible.\n\n**Competitors**\n\nCD PROJEKT is well known for its biggest sales on The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 hype. However, there\u2019s a lot of gaming industries that compete with one another.\n\nThus comparing its competitors such as Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts (EA), Activision Blizzard has more diversified games and games produced more frequently compared to CD PROJEKT RED.\n\nCD Projekt Red's risk in terms of competitors is releasing a big game that clashes with another big game such as GTA 6. However all gaming companies have a good tailwind right now due to COVID restrictions and microtransactions are lifting all gaming companies margins. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n**Industry**\n\n&gt;**-** CAGR 2019-2024 Video games and e-sports growth expected to be 7% (source: PWC Global Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook 2020\u20132024).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- In 2019 the strongest strong growth was observed in the mobile and console segments. The former grew by 9.7%, reaching 68.2 billion USD, while the latter grew by 7.3%, reaching 45.3billion USD. The PC market reached a volume of 35.3 billion USD, having increased by 2.8%.The largest share of the global videogame market is currently held by mobile devices (46%), 80% of which are smartphone releases. Gaming consoles come in second at 30%, followed by the PC 24%. Mobile devices are projected to retain their top position, with their corresponding market volume increasing by 11.2% annually (on average) over the next three years. According to estimates, the volume of the global mobile game market will reach 93.6 billion USD by 2022 (it currently stands at 68.2 billion USD).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can see from the above as to why CD projekt red is branching out to smartphones and China.\n\n**Reverse DCF**  \n\n\nHere's the original post and reverse DCF because r/stocks does not allow images: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr\\_cd\\_projekt\\_red\\_analysis\\_is\\_it\\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr_cd_projekt_red_analysis_is_it_undervalued/)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt's been extremely difficult to project CD Projekt Red and even after doing research I am still very unsure on a bunch of variables. In my opinion the markets assumptions of CD Projekt Red's growth and margins as shown above in the reverse DCF is perfectly acceptable to me. Therefore I would not buy their shares unless they dipped to around 210 zloty\\~ as I don't think they are undervalued yet. given the risks.\n\nPlease comment if you see anything wrong with my valuation. This was a very difficult one for me.\n\nThanks",

That guide got a lot of positive feedback, and I suggest those who missed it take a look. [How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&amp;P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/) And if you are truly retarded check out my recent Tips for Noobies. [Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/)\n\nI've since decided to put my skills to the test and will attempt to double a small $8000 account by the end of 2021 using similar strategies. This will mostly be an educational experience, and I will walk you through all my thought processes and my trades as I make them so hopefully the retards among you can learn a thing or two. And if I blow up the account, that will be entertaining as well, right?\n\nSome of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat. The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?\n\nStill, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades. \n\nWish me luck... I will need it.\n\n# Basic Strategy\n\nI will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.\n\nUsing ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:\n\n**1) Option Implied Volatility &gt;80% (for tendies)**\n\n**2) Stock Volume &gt;5,000,000 (for liquidity)**\n\n**3) Market Cap &gt;$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**\n\n**4) Stock Price &lt;$82 (collateral maximum)**\n\nScanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...\n\n# Running the Numbers\n\nI will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...\n\nSPY premium / DTE = $/day\n\n332 / 5 = 66.4\n\n440 / 10 = 44\n\n652 / 21 = 31\n\n1915 / 140 = 13.7\n\nAs you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.\n\nHere is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:\n\n**(Premium \\* 365) / (DTE \\* Strike) = Max ROI**\n\nBasically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \\~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:\n\nSPY: 12.2\n\nPSTH: 48.1\n\nGME: 140.5\n\nPLTR: 111.1\n\nQS: 263.7\n\nUVXY: 134.2\n\nDon't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.\n\nWe can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an \"Expected Value\" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.\n\nFinally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.\n\n# My First Trade\n\nLooking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!\n\nGameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**\n\nI want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.\n\n21 strike: 74.2\n\n22 strike: 108.4\n\n22.5 strike: 131.9\n\n23 strike: 155.5\n\nEither the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:\n\n**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**\n\nIf Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).\n\nOf course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR- I am going to double a small account, and you are going to watch.**\n\nI will update this post as plays are made, and will create a new post each month as a recap. As always questions are welcome.",

Musk predicts that by the end of the year, Tesla's cars will be able to navigate both surface streets and freeways, allowing them to drive between any two points without human input.\n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, the cars will be \"feature complete,\" in Musk's terminology, but will still need a human driver to monitor the vehicle and intervene in the case of a malfunction. But Musk predicts it will only take about six more months for the software to become reliable enough to no longer require human supervision. By the end of 2020, Musk expects Tesla to have thousands of Tesla vehicles providing driverless rides to people in an Uber-style taxi service.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, Musk seems to believe that once Tesla's cars become \"feature complete\" later this year, they will be 90 percent of the way to full autonomy.

        "selftext": "I got two goals here. One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just \"cloud\" and \"software\" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd\n\nBasically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20\n\nLet's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.\n\nAs you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability. \n\nAnother big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better. \n\nBusiness will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5\n\nBasically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then it could the stock in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be early March.\n\nYou can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; buy puts in march \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: long on GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "**TLDR:**\n\nTesla enters 2021 with huge tailwinds. Bullish for the first half of the year. More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace. Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021. Avoid shorting TSLA.\n\n# The 2021 TSLA trade plan\n\n## What moves the stock?\n\nKnowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics, an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock's price. The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock. According to Macroaxis.com, as of December 30th, Institutions own 42.52% of Tesla's stock, the Public (i.e. Retail Investors) owns 37.46%, and Insiders own 20.02%.\n\n&gt;Institutional investors aren't selling\n\nTSLA's institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S&amp;P500 (which recently added TSLA) to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth. Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure. Today, the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event. The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation. For example, billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla, currently at a $659 billion market cap, should be a $2 trillion dollar company. Another major fund manager, Cathie Wood, gives TSLA a 2024 price target of $7,000. Assuming minimal changes in total float, that equates to almost a $7 trillion dollar market cap!\n\nSo TSLA's institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance.\n\n&gt;Retail investors aren't selling\n\nWhat about TSLA's retail investor base? This question is easily answered. Over the years, TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high, if not higher, expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors. Some people believe the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has developed a cult-of-personality. Tesla's cult-like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company, and in a broader sense, Elon Musk. For example, the main Tesla subreddit, r/ teslamotors, has more than 901,000 subscribers at the time of writing.\n\n&gt;Insiders aren't selling\n\nOf the remaining 20% of TSLA stock, the majority is held by Elon Musk and he's certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR.\n\nSo if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA, TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there's good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in. In other words, TSLA is a heavily news-driven stock with a heavy bias for upside.\n\nThis is exactly what we saw in 2020. TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent. This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it'll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt-burden catches up with the company's treasury. With that, the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights. They included the opening of the Shanghai factory, the 5-for-1 stock split, the S&amp;P500 inclusion, and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter. Even good news from the tangentially-related company SpaceX, who Elon Musk is also the CEO of, has been positive for TSLA.\n\n# The Plan and Headwinds\n\nTesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success. If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution, ceteris paribus (fancy business major speak for \"all other things being equal\"), its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics. Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3's at scale, has a foothold in the Chinese market, and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red-hot North American pickup truck market. In addition, like Pavlov's dogs, 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected post-S&amp;P500 inclusion sell-off (which never happened), and the Apple EV announcement.\n\n**In 2021, it's recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla, no matter how tempting.**\n\nWith that said, there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of. Tesla currently has an 81.66% market share of the US EV market. The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers. Tesla's stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses. GM, Volkswagen, and Ford are leading the pack. GM has invested $27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025. Two EVs have already been announced: the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV, with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response. GM has also developed an in-house battery technology called Ultium that's the central pillar for its 2025 plan. A step above GM, Volkswagen is investing $41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030. It's also aggressively investing in battery technology. For example, Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape, a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid-state battery technology. Last but not least, Ford is investing $11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022. Deliveries of its flagship EV, the well-received Mustang Mach-E, is already underway. An honorable mention goes to Apple, which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024.\n\nIf TSLA is a news-driven stock, a growing string of negative news about the company's shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price. The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock's stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent, serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted.\n\n**In 2021, although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year, it's recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year. This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate. Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves.**\n\nI wrote about stock market DD here: [FinanceTLDR blog](https://www.financetldr.com)",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

        "selftext": "When placing trades, I think of calls and puts at the same strike and expiry. You can convert between the two using 100 shares of long or short stock. The fundamental reason is that the extrinsic value is identical. \n\nSince everyone is following PLTR these days, let's use it as an example:  \n\n\\-----------------------\n\nSelling a $22 put = Buying 100 shares and selling a call at $22 (OTM CSP = ITM CC)\n\nBuying 100 shares and selling a call at $30 = Selling a $30 put at $30 (OTM CC = ITM CSP)\n\nGetting assigned a cash-secured put at $25, then selling a covered call at $25 = Rolling the $25 put out in time (CSP assignment, then selling a CC = put calendar) \n\nGetting assigned your covered call at $20, then selling a cash-secured put at $20 = Rolling the $20 call out in time (CC assignment, then selling a CSP = call calendar) \n\nBuying 100 shares and buying a put at $25 = Buying a call at $25 (Married put = Call) \n\nShorting 100 shares and buying a call at $25 = Buying a put at $25 (Married call = Put)\n\nBuying 100 shares, buying ATM put, selling OTM call = Buying ATM call, selling OTM call (Collar = Call debit spread) \n\nBuying 100 shares = selling a put, buying a call at the same strike (100 shares = Short put + long call) \n\n\\----------------------\n\nIn practice, these equivalencies have important caveats/exceptions\n\n\\- ITM options are less liquid\n\n\\- In normal skew situations, OTM puts are slightly more expensive than the ITM calls, benefitting put sellers\n\n\\- In reverse skew situations (highly specutive stocks), OTM calls are more expensive than the ITM put, benefitting call sellers\n\n\\- If a stock is hard to short, puts are more expensive across all strikes, benefitting put sellers\n\n\\- Some positions require more buying power then the equivalent position\n\n\\- Holding stock gives you dividends \n\n\\- Holding short calls elevates early assignment risk due to dividends \n\n\\- The more legs a trade has, the harder it is to fill\n\n\\----------------------\n\nExperienced traders - did I make any mistakes?

R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)'s [Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth) [legendarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien%27s_legendarium). A *palant\u00edr* (from [Quenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya) *palan*, 'far; *tir*, 'watch over'[\\[T 1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr#cite_note-1)) is described as an indestructible [ball of crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_ball), used for communication and to see events in other parts of [Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_(Middle-earth)), whether past or future.' - Is this what Palantir will do in the future? See the past or future with their powerful programmes?\n\nMithril:\n\nThe scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar writes that *mithril* was the only mineral that Tolkien invented. He notes that in Tolkien's underworld, whether the [caves at Helm's Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glittering_Caves_of_Aglarond) or the mines of Moria, \"beauty and terror \\[were\\] side by side\".[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) Greed for *mithril* could unleash the terror of the [Balrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog), by digging too far down into the dark realm, but at the same time, he writes, the metal was prized for both its beauty and its usefulness, yielding the best armour. He compares the Dwarves' greed for *mithril* with that of the Barrow-wights for treasure, and indeed that of the [dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon) in [*The Hobbit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit) and [*Beowulf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf) for gold. In his view, these symbolise the evil \"inherent in the mineral treasures hidden in the womb of Earth\",[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) just as mining and metalwork are associated with [Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan) in [John Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton)'s [*Paradise Lost*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost) (I, 670-751). Huttar sums up with a reflection on Tolkien's moral vision in the story: just as the characters at every point have to decide for good or ill, so objects have the potential to be both good and evil: \"Mithril is both the greatest of treasures and a deadly bane. \n\nDoes Peter Thiel actually use the names that have meanings behind them on what the company is going to achieve or is it just some cool names chosen from the LOTR universe?\n\nAs we can see Mithril can be used for good and ill, will that be the case with Palantir? If it gets in the wrongs hands could that bring a deadly bane or if it gets into the good hands could that bring the greatest treasure?\n\nDoes that basically mean I am too retarded or are we going to the moon on this rocket  \ud83d\ude80 ?",

        "selftext": "Amazing to see this ticker still brought up on this thread at times. Let\u2019s dive into the countless red flags this company has produced in the last several months.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Bruce Bernstein. Currently on the board of directors for XSPA. Many allegations brought against him for fraud relating to the company.\n\nBernstein securities fraud [Bruce securities fraud case ](https://www.teribuhl.com/2019/03/11/ny-journalist-wins-lawsuit-to-unseal-court-docs-tied-to-bruce-bernstein-securities-fraud-case-xspa/)\n\n[SEC violations ](https://www.teribuhl.com/2018/09/19/rockmore-capitals-bruce-bernstein-ex-wife-outs-him-for-possible-sec-violations-in-xspa-deal/)\n\n[More allegations](https://www.scribd.com/document/408580774/Rockmore-Capital-Bruce-Bernstein-TRO-in-XpresSpa-fraud-suit-April-29-2019)\n\nReverse splits: XSPA performed a R/S in February of 2019, and June of 2020. That\u2019s right, two within two years. The recent R/S has watched their stock bleed from near $7-$8 levels, to the current SP of $1.23. A constant 6 months downtrend. 9.8/10 reverse splits NEVER work out for the companies performing them. \n\nBlatant lies from the CEO: Not going to touch on all of them since there\u2019s been so many. CEO stated in August there was no need for more offerings unless they \u201cwent gangbusters\u201d. 4 days later they issued a direct offering. Headed into 2021 they have 5 locations up and running. Gangbusters no doubt.\n\nHe then stated there was no need for another offering for 2020. What happened 2 weeks ago. You guessed it, another offering! They released their 8K announcing their partnership with United airlines (which by the way is only for flights heading to Hawaii and nothing more). Another offering after a $0.30 pop in SP. Shows you exactly how confident they are in their new business venture.\n\nWarrants: There are warrants at $5.25, $3.02, and now $1.70. After each offering the SP has never crossed the warrants exercisable price. Not once. For the higher warrants, the institutions likely dumped their shares at break even and shorted on the way down, using the warrants as their hedge. So much warrant saturation.\n\nShares remaining: Around 2 million shares remain to be distributed. Means not enough shares for offerings. They will likely have to vote on adding more shares to the float, thus diluting even more. What would happen after? Likely another R/S. Their third in 3 consecutive years. \n\nRevenue model: XSPA is paid strictly as a landlord. They do not make money per test administered. The MSA agreement was necessary since they aren\u2019t in the medical field. \n\nReporting revenue: XSPA cannot report their revenue until they have 2-3 (sometimes 4) consecutive quarters of contract income due to GAAP laws. This means they will not be able to report their income earned from testing next quarter. \n\nSabby/ intracoastel: There\u2019s no denying they have shorted this into oblivion. With no revenue to report in makes it an easy target. Many have suggested their recent buy in was \u201cfor the ride up\u201d what ride would that be? \n\nThe Spa business: Their spas failed to turn a profit for 63 straight consecutive quarters. Doing roughly 40-45 million per year in revenue. Let\u2019s assume for their new testing venture, they\u2019re paid 1 million in MSA fees per testing site. Right now that would be 5 million per quarter, 20 million per year. Far less then the failing spas were generating. \n\nI see people on here and Stocktwits holding out hope. If you\u2019re holding in the $3\u2019s, $4\u2019s, $5\u2019s and hell even $6\u2019s which I\u2019ve sadly seen. Please cut your losses. High $1\u2019s to mid $2\u2019s you could possibly break even on the random spike that happens to many penny stocks. Only saving grace would be for testing to be mandated before boarding any airplane regardless of destination.",

        "selftext": "In 2020, there was clearly a large divergence in the performance of different classes of REITs after COVID-19 hit.\n\n**Industrial REITs:** these recovered well after COVID hit, as industrial workplaces reopened and there was actually an increase in demand for warehouses and logistics facilities, to support e-commerce.  For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* Granite (GRT) is up 18% \n* Summit Industrial (SMU) is up 13%\n* Dream Industrial (DIR) had no change\n* WPT Industrial (WIR) is down 3%\n\n**Residential REITs**: these are down from where they started 2020, but recovered most of their value.  In some places, occupancy rates dropped as workplaces and universities went online and as people lost jobs, causing some to move in with family to save on rent, while others accelerated plans to become homeowners to have more space to work from home. For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* Canadian Apartments (CAR) is down 6%,\n* Killam (KMP) is down 10%\n* Minto (MI) is down 12%\n* InterRent (IIP) is down 12%\n* Boardwalk (BEI) is down 27%\n\n**Retail REITS**: these were often harder hit, as retail businesses saw reduced foot traffic, due to lockdowns, capacity limits, and people staying home to avoid exposure to the virus. E-commerce and deliveries surged as an alternative to in-person shopping, and it's not clear what the long-term impacts will be on brick-and-mortar stores.  For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* Canadian Tire (CRT) is down 3%\n* Choice Properties (CHP) is down 6%\n* Slate Grocery (SGR) is down 14%\n* Plaza (PLZ) is down 21%\n* SmartCentres (SRU) is down 26%\n* RioCan (REI) is down 37%\n\n**Office REITS**: these seem to have been hit the hardest.  Many office-based workplaces sent their employees home to work remotely, and there are questions about whether that trend will persist, and whether companies will choose to cut back on their office space in the future, for the cost savings.  For example, from Jan 1 to Dec 31:\n\n* True North Commerical (TNT) is down 13%\n* Allied Properties (AP) is down 27%\n* Slate Office (SOT) is down 29%\n* Dream Office (D) is down 36%\n\nSo with all of that in mind, my question is: which category of REIT will perform best in 2021, in terms of rise or fall in share price?\n\nAnd as a bonus question: which individual REIT do you think will perform best in 2021?

Feel free to do your own DD but i think after that you\u2019ll be on this boat with me.

Which has world renound / very well known delivery technology and development solution for drugs, biologics, and consumer and animal health products.               \n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/21/2148705/0/en/Novan-Engages-Catalent-to-Develop-Intranasal-Formulation-of-Berdazimer-Sodium-for-COVID-19-Program.html\n\n\u201cNovan initiated in vitro assessments of its NITRICIL\u2122 platform against the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, targeting the reduction of viral burden in differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the scientific literature and data available to-date with berdazimer sodium and  Novan\u2019s product candidate SB206, Novan believes that nitric oxide may inhibit viral replication by disrupting protein function critical for viral replication and infection through generation of reactive intermediates.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollowing the initial positive in vitro results that we announced earlier, we believe berdazimer sodium has the potential to offer benefit in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and we look forward to further exploring its potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollowing the completion of preclinical studies, Novan is targeting filing a potential IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, subject to obtaining additional funding, targets initiating human clinical trials in the second half of 2021.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, with that being said, the stock had traded around 1.0-1.1$ on Wednesday, the 29th, and dropped to where it has been consolidating with around .8-.9$ a share with VERY bullish outlooks, and there seems to be resistence around .8. When it was at 1.0$-1.1, it was being traded with a daily of 160mil volume, the stock didnt get much attention friday so it was very easily manipulated down the ranks. All in all i have great hopes for the outlook of 2021. Thank You.",

Open and read these points before every trade you make.\n\n2. Buy options that are no less than 4 weeks from expiring. Ideally, they would have at least 8 weeks until expiration or longer.\n\n3. Buy calls or puts at the money or close to it. \n\n4. STOP JUMPING INTO STOCKS THAT YOU HAVE NOT MONITORED FOR AT LEAST 1-2 WEEKS.\n\na. This will give you an idea of what the stock is doing and the type of price action you are stepping into. \n\nb. If you miss out before entry, move on to another stock. They are plenty of stocks in the sea. \n\n5. Remember past events or trade outcomes will not determine how a new trade works out. If the stock is not going in the direction you thought it would GET OUT! Do not waste time wondering why and or going against what the price action is saying or doing. \n\n6. As much as you can, remove your emotions. Become a robot when it comes to trading. \n\n7. STOP CHASING THE MONEY YOU HAVE LOST!!!!!!!\n\n8. STOP ALLOWING YOURSELF TO HAVE DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR. Its okay to dream just not in stock trading. Take profits when you can. It is okay if you make 5-10% in a trade before pulling the trigger. Not every trade will turn out to be 100% or 1000% return. \n\n9. Pay attention when Cramer pounds the table about a stock. Buy long dated Calls.\n\n10. YOU NEED VOLUME for a stock to move.

Since my husband and I use fidelity, we considered setting up a brokerage account and letting them pick an index fund so they have some involvement too.

Feel free to do your own DD but i think after that you\u2019ll be on this boat with me. Very Convincing. \n\nRecently, NOVN, A North Carolina Clinical developement stage biotech company, has enetered an MSA agreement with Catalent, $CTLT. Which has world renound / very well known delivery technology and development solution for drugs, biologics, and consumer and animal health products.               \n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/21/2148705/0/en/Novan-Engages-Catalent-to-Develop-Intranasal-Formulation-of-Berdazimer-Sodium-for-COVID-19-Program.html\n\n\u201cNovan initiated in vitro assessments of its NITRICIL\u2122 platform against the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, targeting the reduction of viral burden in differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the scientific literature and data available to-date with berdazimer sodium and  Novan\u2019s product candidate SB206, Novan believes that nitric oxide may inhibit viral replication by disrupting protein function critical for viral replication and infection through generation of reactive intermediates.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollowing the initial positive in vitro results that we announced earlier, we believe berdazimer sodium has the potential to offer benefit in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and we look forward to further exploring its potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollowing the completion of preclinical studies, Novan is targeting filing a potential IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, subject to obtaining additional funding, targets initiating human clinical trials in the second half of 2021.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, with that being said, the stock had traded around 1.0-1.1$ on Wednesday, the 29th, and dropped to where it has been consolidating with around .8-.9$ a share with VERY bullish outlooks, and there seems to be resistence around .8. When it was at 1.0$-1.1, it was being traded with a daily of 160mil volume, the stock didnt get much attention friday so it was very easily manipulated down the ranks.

        "selftext": "Ticker BABA on the nasdaq\n\nGo easy since its my first piece of DD, and I'm doing this to get different inputs on the company\n\nReason for DD: stock id down almost 30% from ATH\n\nI do not own any shares of alibaba \n\n \n\n*Processing img 8845zmm21r861...*\n\n**Quantitative assessment**\n\nAlibaba is a leading platform for global wholesale trade that serve million of buyers and suppliers around the world (mainly known for being prominent in Asia)\n\nLike amazon, their core e-commerce business consists of connecting third party sellers into one platform but, unlike amazon, they do not hold inventory and do not store /ship it.\n\n**How they make money**\n\n**E-commerce:** They make the main bulk of their money by charging a commission fee from transactions and a subscription fee to sellers. They say a 29% YoY growth in their revenues here.\n\n**Cloud operations:** From Investopedia: \u201cAlibaba Cloud provides enterprise customers with a complete suite of cloud services, including database, storage, management and application services, big data analytics, a machine-learning platform, and other services. The company's cloud computing segment generates revenue from enterprise customers based on the duration and specific usage of the services.\u201d This is the fastest growing segment of their business, reaching a 60% YoY revenue growth \n\n**Entertainment:** it\u2019s a small part of their business and generates subscription-based revenue (8% YoY revenue growth)\n\nIn Q3 2020, 84% of their revenue can be attributed to commerce and the other 16% to cloud/entertainment/innovation initiatives and others (10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively)\n\nBeing such a large company, they touch many sectors, lots of which are expected to keep growing quickly in the future.\n\n**Management**\n\nWould love to hear your input on this one (i.e. I'm too lazy to look into the decisions they make and I don't know how I feel about Jack Ma)\n\n**Competition**\n\nTheir main competitor is Amazon, but other ones include eBay and Tencent holdings (the latter a Chinese tech company). Alibaba is very dominant in the Asian e-commerce markets. \n\n**Recent concerns**\n\nAt the time of this writing, the stock is down almost 27% from its late-October peak, a drop in price attributed to a recent antitrust investigation launched by the Chinese government for monopolistic behavior by essentially forcing sellers to chose only a single e-commerce platform. Additionally, Ant Group (their fintech sister company) had been denied an IPO a while back and keeps getting scrutiny from the government. The main risk here for Alibaba might be that they\u2019re forced to divest some parts of their business. Personally, I think monopolistic concerns could keep emerging in the future as the company keeps growing however, I believe that despite these concerns, they can still strive as a business. There's plenty of YouTube videos and financial articles that cover this so I recommend those for more details.\n\n**Quantitative assessment (USD)**\n\nMarket cap: $650B \n\nQ3 2020 revenue: $22,8M (up 30% YoY, with forward projected growth of 36%)\n\nA few metrics stacked up against competitors (for the readers interpretation):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xte5e455qq861.png?width=1357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c1eb19bda6e576e1a2c8675fd7ca35f55a7baec\n\nThe recent drop in share price has BABA trading at a discount compared to its main competitor amazon. Growing revenues in all aspects of their business mentioned above is encouraging to see as well. \n\nAlibaba seems to offer great value in an expensive tech market (especially considering the low PE ratio despite growing their revenues pretty fast), the main question is: are the risks of Chinese government regulations that can be imposed on the company worth the opportunity? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI skimmed through the company pretty quickly and there's plenty of details in their fundamental business that I didn't talk about, I just tried to give a big picture view. I recommend also doing your own research on the risks with this company since government investigations seem complex and there's other risks such as the fact that you're actually buying a holding company legally domiciled in the Cayman Islands.  \n\n That Investopedia article I referred to: [How Alibaba Makes Money: core e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121714/how-does-alibaba-make-money-simple-guide.asp) \n\nAlibaba q3 results presentation:  [Alibaba Group September Quarter 2020 Results](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/ir/presentations/pre201105.pdf) \n\nActual q3 financial results pdf: [Microsoft Word - Alibaba Group Announces September Quarter 2020 Results\\_vF](https://alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p201105.pdf) \n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on Alibaba\n\nAlso, happy new year!",

        "selftext": "Happy New Year everyone. Some of us would have had great year this year in the market and some not. However, we can all take the lessons learnt into this year to become better traders/investors.\n\nI didn't actually start until 2 months ago, and thanks to this community, I was able to pick a few winners (although had to sieve through a bunch of p&amp;ds and making mistakes along the way). Below are somethings I learnt (all circumstantial and isn't always the case) and hope it helps some of you. Feel free to disagree wit any of them and let me know what some of ur lessons learnt are!\n\n1) Gap ups at open are usually followed by sharp drops before stabilising. Depending on your style of trading this is a great way for you to flip. But for me, the opening 5 to 10 minutes is most often too volatile to make decisions. When I first begun, I used to see a company I like, see a massive spike up, try to follow the train, only to get burnt buying near the top before the inevitable drop a few minutes after.\n\n2) its fine to take profits even if it means missing out on more gains if that stock continues to skyrocket. This depends on your amount of DD and trust in what you put money in. Prime example for me was BNGO. Avg at 0.7, sold at 0.8. Sure if I've held, could have made much more, but in that time, I was able to use my profits to make even more on other stocks. I couldn't have know it would have continued to rocket. Another strategy is just put a stop loss, and let it ride.\n\n3) if you are lucky to have one of your investments return over 100% (which I think it's actually quite common with penny stocks although I might be naive in this thinking), it's safer to take out the initial investment and just let the profit ride. But if you really know and trust your investment, then the risk of leaving your initial investment is worth it. Prime example for me was ABML, hit 100% quite early but took out initial investment, looking back, I would have let it all ride out.\n\n4) There are some absolute gems of DDs in here by high level contributors (you know who you are) and this is my own personal opinion. If you are already seeing multiple posts about the same ticker flooding the page already, it's probably had its run. Sure, it might have more room to run and you can risk it and jump on a moving train. But for me, the most effective strategy has been looking at tickers mentions which are still relatively less hyped. This way I can get on and know that once it starts running, I can ride out the up and downs, because my average is so low. The problem with jumping on the moving trains are that, those with the low averages will keep trying to pump it, knowing they can survive the few intra or multiple day dumps, but for you guys who are asking for example if it's time to still jump in things like BNGO or CUVO, after it's already run a few multiple 100% days, you have to do it accepting you are taking a massive risk. Again, this isn't always the case. E.g ALPP, most people were scared to jump in at like 0.5 or 0.6 etc because it was already running like crazy, so they were waiting for a dip that never really came. This again goes back to trusting ur instincts about the company and do some DD.\n\n5) If you have faith in a company and a strategy, trust it even when there are massive dips. Over the last few days, ALPP has taking some beatings (still minor compared to how much it has run). When I first started, I would get scared at the slightest drops, and if I have seen how much ALPP can drop when it decides to dip, I would have been shitting bricks. What I learnt was patience can sometimes pay off. Massive dips are usually followed by people picking shares up at a discount. Although it might not go all the way back up to what it was at open, selling during a dip has always worked out bad for me. What I do now is wait until the dip is over and let people push it back up and stabilise before I make a decision. Having said that, if I had no faith in the company and was only in it for a quick buck, I would just sell as it starts to drop and take my profits. \n\nThat's it for now and would love to hear your lessons learnt and what you hope the achieve in 2021. For me is to actually learn how to read the charts, and know how to analyse fundamentals. But currently I don't feel the necessasity, especially with fundamentals, I think (maybe naively again) the markets are currently being more sensitive to hype and PR more than the actual fundamentals. For chart reading wise, I don't know any of the actual technicals but just been learning my own patterns I see through experience and being burnt.\n\nGood luck with your 2021!",

Recent S-8 allows Barry Igdaloff to sell his shares into a secondary offering so Mr. Market will never see the hundreds of millions he may make by duplicating the Newcastle NCT reorganization at Novation Companies Inc. $NOVC. Call Wesley Edens, Peter Briger, Co-CEOs of Fortress or Emanuel J. Manny Friedman CEO of EJF Capital, or Mass Mutual Barings that have 19.3M shares of NOVC.

This could be a good entry point considering members of this sponsorship team, Jeff Sagansky and Harry Sloan, have closed numerous successful SPACs in the past - including $DKNG and $SKLZ...  Furthermore, this same team just filed to bring another new issue, Spinning Eagle Acquisition , so I interpret that to signal they must have multiple targets in mind and could be close to announcing a business combination for $FCAC in the coming months??\n\n$FEAC, which became $SKLZ (Skillz Mobile Gaming), IPO'd on March 5th and announced the DMA on September 2nd, slightly under 6 months - pretty quick considering the lockdown hit right after the deal priced...   $FCAC units priced on September 21st, roughly 3 months ago, so I would not be surprised to see a deal in the coming months...\n\nI noticed Benzinga picked this as one of their top 10 picks [Link to YouTube Video pump](https://youtu.be/9qjzsdwwfA4?t=844)\n\n\"@SpacGuru seems to like this one too [https://twitter.com/SpacGuru/status/1344682789434773505](https://twitter.com/SpacGuru/status/1344682789434773505)\n\nHere's the link to the management team in the prospectus, if you are interested in doing thorough DD [Officers and Directors](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816233/000121390020028037/f424b4_falconcapitalacqcorp.htm#T11)\n\nAnd a few charts:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sv1shd91fq861.jpg?width=581&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a57b45310c3d47ae8462226393eeb553b4043eac\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9vmfqh5efq861.jpg?width=584&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=023df72fae6d0230ac08edca75262b8fe8efea3a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zh8euwrkfq861.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3342e5f9275345c78673ef9bbeb9e6f2224c54c\n\nSeems like a no brainer to me - commons trading at 54 cent over NAV and serious upside potential if you are willing to hold it for a few months...

I don't have enough capital to really benefit from having 3 of their services, so I figured there might be some other folks on the same boat. If it makes it easier, I'm willing to buy a new service and add it to my account and then split the cost of the service with you and then share the account but I understand that some people might not feel comfortable with that. Otherwise we can share some of their picks via Google drive links or whatsoever. I know the risks of doing this but I'm ok gambling with it.\n\nAnyhow I got the Everlasting stock service for 2 years ($99) and If anyone wants to split the other services I can get them for $45 for the stock advisor and $99 for the Rulebreakers. I get random discount emails for Stock advisor at $45 but I know I can get it for 99$ reliably for a year. I only feel comfortable sharing with 3-4 other people but I doubt there will be enough interest. If I get 3-4 people on this we can split all 3 services at a maximum $100-$75 each which is better than spending $300 individually.  Otherwise just sharing their picks sounds good to me!\n\nCheers!",

I\u2019m having a hard time finding good videos that I feel I can trust. Every one is full of SmaSH tHAt SuBscRIBe BuTtOn, BRO! \n\nIf I understand correctly, most of my risk comes from having to buy back the contracts I sold, if they are about to go ITM when I need to roll them. OR if things tank big time and I want to exit my LEAPs, I have to buy back the sold contracts before I can sell the LEAPS, right? \n\nI wanted to try this method in a less risky position for myself before I used my expensive SPY leaps, so I sold a call against a $JETS 22 JAN $20 C, for like $40 with an expiration of early FEB, just to see what happens with it. I\u2019ll watch it for the month to get an idea of what happens, and hopefully combine that experience with any responses to this/ learning resources you guys recommend. \n\nThanks for any help and ideas.",

        "selftext": "#I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING PROCEED WITH CAUTION \n\nAccording to this sub there are three things going for $BB that cause it to be undervalued:\n- Cylance Acquisition \n- Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS\n- QNX \n\n## Cylance: I'll start with the one I don't know shit about \n\nThis is a crowded space (anti virus). That's all I have to say about that.\n\n## Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS:\n\nAWS is fighting hard to get market share in the edge computing space. Perfect example of this is AWS Greengrass and IoT core.\n\nWhat is [AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)? It's IoT device management. AWS is going to do the device lifecycle management for QNX deployments on vehicles. (speculation) Essentially, this looks to be AWS Greengrass integrated with BB QNX.  \n\nWhy does AWS want to partner with BB QNX? Well to me, this looks to be a classic extend embrace extinguish play by Amazon. AWS has products such as IoT core that can manage telematics flow between OEMs and vehicles, what they don't have is products for in vehicle development. Once they understand the market, they will introduce AWS products along side IoT core to replace QNX piece by piece in the vehicles. \n\n## QNX\n\nOk WSB. Y'all keep saying that QNX will take $BB to the moon because all these upstart EV nobodies are using QNX to bootstrap their infotainment systems. \n\nEnter automotive linux: https://www.automotivelinux.org/\n\nAutomotive linux is a partnership with a TON of traditional OEMS to build an open source software (linux) stack for vehicles such as infotainment, edge compute and telematics. \n\nThis is effectively the nail in the coffin (IMO) for QNX. If these EV upstarts gain marketshare, they have no reason to continue paying $BB for a closed source, price-y QNX. They'll migrate to automotive linux for F R E E. No more niche QNX developers, get a generic dev with some linux info and they'll be up to speed in no time. \n\nIf QNX dies, so does the IVY partnership. In fact, since AGL linux based and open source, no doubt Amazon will make amazing AWS client libraries to integrate with Greengrass, IoT Core, etc. Once Amazon gets its fingers into AGL, IVY is dead in the water.\n\n\nSo where does this leave us? Cylance. In my know nothing option $BB's only asset is Cylance in a highly competitive space. Once virus protection entities get big enough, hackers start developing FUD (fully undetectable) solutions to the most popular virus protection software. Back in their day you think McAfee or Norton was shit? No. They became popular and had hackers develop against their software.\n\n----\n\nGL WSB on $BB. I hope you succeed. I have no position on $BB. I'm all in $GME \ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: CRSR looks like a bargain at $36/share and low market cap at 3 bil. PC gaming bout to explode. Check the market for this shit. GME PC build stations? Which products they gonna stock? Best in class of course (from a dedicated gaming company). Oh, and Corsair is developing affordable and accessible streaming hardware to a generation of kids who live in front of their screens and meet their friends in games? Hello, moon.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\n\nSo, over the past couple weeks, our beloved savior GME has truly nutted the fuck up under the astounding tutelage of Ryan \ud83e\udd5c Cohen. We\u2019ve learned that Cohen and friends are likely (or definitely, depending on which store you call) pushing for PC build stations in brick and mortar GameStop stores. Just a matter of time before this happens (suck my dick, COVID). If you\u2019re like me, this news made your 2-inch, Cohen-ready pen0r stand at ultimate attention. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\n\nAs of now, PC builds are fucking confusing for consumers attempting to enter the space. While PCs provide a much better gaming experience, as well as greater modification opportunities, for consumers, it\u2019s intimidating as fuck for people eager to enter the space. I, for one, tried to dig into this during the summer, and I was stonewalled by: A. An overwhelming amount of options; B. Conflicting information; C. Lack of knowledge in building my own PC. \n\nIf only I had someone who could just fucking tell me what to buy and what to do to create and build a PC that fits my budget while providing an in-person experience with physical products on display... Because what the fuck am I even looking at on MicroCenter.com? And why, when I go to MicroCenter, do every single one of those tie-wearing FUCKS try to sell me Norton anti-virus??? As a gamer, I\u2019d much rather be sold a Gamepass subscription, honestly... (GME + MSFT DD).\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\n\nNow, when I walk into GameStop and head to the PC build station, which products are going to be stocked???? \n\nWell, after combing through Reddit, as well as tapping the knowledge of my PC-gaming friends who\u2019ve been doing this shit since I was jerking it to fuzzy, late-night, X-rated cable stations (you mini autists don\u2019t know a thing about the struggle pre-PornHub), the consensus was very clear:\n\nCorsair makes the best shit. They\u2019re the best at what they do. Albeit a bit overpriced... but the best in class. And PC people don\u2019t mind spending top-dollar for long lasting gear (PC Master Race or whatever, okay, cool, ya fuckin neckbeard Nazi). \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what does Corsair make that\u2019s so great? Some of the most important shit you need for a build, as well as peripherals:\n\n- CPU/GPU coolers\n- SSDs\n- Cases \n- Keyboards \n- Mice \n- Speakers \nEtc etc \n\nWhat is most exciting about Corsair in the near future is their push for selling affordable streaming hardware. Check this shit out: [Corsair &amp; Elgato ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tomshardware.com/amp/news/corsair-acquires-epoccam-app-to-boost-elgato-game-streaming-business)\n\nThese young kids aren\u2019t even getting their fucking LICENSE TO DRIVE A CAR because all their stupid fucking friends are online circlejerking to Fortnite streams. These kids don\u2019t even play the game. They watch someone else stream a fucking game. Okay, whatever. But now these kids are gonna wanna stream for themselves. Why? Because: A. They can\u2019t leave their house because they didn\u2019t get a fucking license; B. They idolize a Twitch streamer and think the epitome of life\u2019s success lies in the ability to tap some buttons faster than someone else and if you can show your friends how fast you tap buttons you\u2019re God.\n\nSo... When I walk into GameStop to build my PC, and I wanna be the next cool streamer, what the fuck am I gonna buy?\n\n- CORSAIR CPU COOLING UNIT\n- CORSAIR GPU COOLING UNIT\n- CORSAIR KEYBOARD\n- CORSAIR MOUSE\n- CORSAIR SPEAKERS \n- CORSAIR STREAMING CHIP \n- CORSAIR HEADPHONES \n- CORSAIR FUCKIN CONDOMS WITH RYAN COHEN\u2019S SMUG LITTLE FACE ON THE GODDAMN TIP!!!!\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo why am I loading up on CRSR now? It\u2019s a bargain-bin price, from my perspective. It looks absolutely delicious around $36. 3 bil market cap? Best in class? Dedicated to ensuring quality hardware for customers, and dedicated to the space? \n\nWhen GME opens their PC build stations, I have a strong erection in my pants telling me that Corsair will be there, and PC gaming is about to get a whole lot more popular. \n\nTO THE MOON!\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "# The Metric\n\nI recently had an idea for a metric to be used to find hot stocks. I call the metric \"Price Elasticity\" and it is comprised of two numbers: upturn elasticity and downturn elasticity.\n\n* Upturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market up days\n* Downturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market down days\n\nUsing these numbers and a few additional basic requirements (like positive EPS and at least 31 days of trading history), my screener found 99 stocks out of about 5700 searched that have good to exceptional price elasticities. (the list of these stocks is linked below and also [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing))\n\n# What makes for good price elasticity numbers?\n\nI made two classifications for stocks with good price elasticity data.\n\n1. **Irrational** \\- Upturn elasticity &gt; 1, Downturn elasticity &lt; 0\n2. **Responsible** \\- Upturn elasticity &gt; 1, 0 &lt; Downturn elasticity &lt; 1\n\nWith any stock I want an upturn elasticity &gt; 1, meaning that the stock tends to move higher than the market when the market goes up. The \"Irrational\" classification gets its name because if a stock's downturn elasticity is negative this means the stock, on average, moves up when the market goes down. So a stock that moves higher than the market when the market goes up and also moves up when the market goes down is classified as \"Irrational\". These stocks tend to have less trading history and are very volatile.\n\nThen there are \"Responsible\" stocks which like Irrational stocks move higher than the market when the market goes up. Unlike Irrational stocks though, Responsible stocks move lower when the market moves lower. The reason I still consider them good is because their downturn elasticity is &lt;1 and &gt;0, meaning that, while they do move down with the market, they move down to a lesser degree.\n\nSome popular stocks picked up by the screener include: AMD, ADSK, ETSY, NFLX, NVDA, SHOP and TSLA. Many of the other stocks have lower market caps and could be interesting value / growth plays given they too made the cut.\n\n# Link to the 99 stocks found:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea if there is merit to my Price Elasticity metric (or if it has already been \"invented\") but it was a fun project and the screener found some interesting stocks I would have never discovered otherwise. The validity of the metric is entirely based on the assumption that past trends indicate future performance, and for those looking to beat the market the trends of these 99 stocks should be very appealing. I made the screener using Python3 and TD Ameritrade's API. Of the stocks in that list I am currently holding AMD, CAMT, EPAM, and NLOK.",

        "selftext": "I've been in the telecommunications industry for many years, an investor for a few decades but mostly mfunds.  Wsb lurker.\n\nWhat I'm writing today about is my insights to broadband technology to the home. Not 5g, aapl or some shit. All the actual products that make your broadband work.\n\nHistory:\nBack in the day (15 to 20 years ago), your main vendors for dsl was alcatel, adtran, AFC/tellabs, the huge companies.\nCisco focused mostly on cable cmts platforms.\nCosts were very high and it was all capital in equipment spending. Profits were also high as anything other than dialup was worth the huge spend.\n \nI have seen dozens of vendors drop off the face of the earth for broadband such as copper mountain, teledyne, zhone (recently back in the picture but not much), pannaway, occam. Tellabs has fallen to an also ran and adtean also lags well behind in innovation and sales.\n\nIn the last few years the focus has been on fiber to the home which is basically the golden ticket.  Whoever gets there first in a city, wins the customers, spawning a huge race.\nCable is still very fast but DSL, even later versions is way too slow, and fiber is the end goal.\n\nI've used calix equipment for over 15 years and have watched it change from an equipment provider to a behemoth of marketing and monthly income.  Here's a short history to summarize:\n\n-calix has competing platform for vdsl, fiber and dial tone with occam networks.  They purchase occam for the platform, thereby merging two of the largest smaller companies into one. 2010.\n\n-calix purchases ericcsons fiber to the home tech in 2012\n\n-2015, calix focuses on moving things to the cloud using aws. They develop everything from management of the end user devices, customer cloud based app for their antivirus, wifi settings, etc.\nAlso a marketing app that pulls all the customer data, speeds, usage and allows providers to contact and upsell.  A complete ecosystem end to end not just an equipment provider.\n\n-calix becomes first ngpon2 supplier for 10 gigabit pon including signing a huge contract with Verizon a few years ago.\n\n-calix becomes the first mesh wifi provider for good in home wifi from ISP, including new wifi6 802.11ax. no other vendor has a wifi6 solution available.\n\nThat takes us up to where we are now.\nSo what's good going forward ?\n\n1) huawei/zte aren't used in north america much anymore as competition.   Bell canada used them a lot for LTE radios in cellular and for gpon fiber. They have been replaced with alcatel-lucent which is now called nokia.  Nokia costs a lot more, most companies do not use them.\n\n2) ceo and founder is Carl Russo, who also founded cerent before selling to cisco for a fortune. Several vp have come from bell canada, microsoft and at&amp;t and are well known experts in their field.\n\n3) sales and profits have been increasing every quarter for years,. Not pump and dump.\n\n4) manufacturing went to Vietnam in the wake of trump and chinese tariffs, so not affected by potential chinese relations with biden taking over.\n\n5) Covid19- the world is working from home, learning from home. This has caused all levels of government to provide massive subsidies and funding to build broadband to rural and semi rural areas where calix is the number one supplier.  With the monthly cloud subscriptions for managing all the customers it's not just sales, but ongoing revenue.\n\n6) they are hiring at a ridiculous pace. Their website has list to all postings.  \n\n7) the last few years and continuing are broadband initiatives i.e. \nhttps://www.calix.com/news-and-events/news-and-media-hub.html\n\n8) financial reports show good growth and ongoing sales trending upwards. Broadband growth continues to rise. Q4 announcements end of this month.\nStock has already gone up in price by 6x in 12 months.\nhttps://investor-relations.calix.com/home/default.aspx\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CALX/\n\nI don't own any stock, not saying it's a sure thing or pumping it.  I do think that they are still under valued and growing at a fast but steady rate.\nCheers.",

(formerly LiCo) has 100% ownership of two highly prospective cobalt properties located in the historical Cobalt Camp in Northern Ontario Canada. With the Teledyne and Glencore Bucke properties, Fuse is well positioned to move forward with cobalt focused exploration programs in line with the global trend toward zero emission electric vehicles powered by lithium ion battery technology where cobalt use is critical to stability and range. Highlights from 2017 drilling at Glencore Bucke included 8.42% cobalt in hole GB 17-15 over 0.3 m and at Teledyne, hole TE-1704 5.06% Co over 1.75 m (drill intersected width.) Fuse Cobalt Inc. is listed on the TSXV Venture Exchange under the symbol FUSE and in the U.S. on the OTCQB symbol FUSEF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy I think Cobalt will go up from here:\n\nFuse\u2019s strategy is to advance these projects into operations mining cobalt for use in a variety of end-use applications, such as batteries for EVs - a global market\u00a0expected to reach $802 billion by 2027. Cobalt is a key component used in the majority of EV batteries, and Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) recent deal to buy cobalt from Swiss miner Glencore is a key indicator that the cobalt market is heating up. \n\n\"Fuse believes in the long-term cobalt commodity demand given that EV's are expected to number over 140 million vehicles by 2035, and each EV needs approximately 50 lbs of cobalt for its battery. Due to this heightened metal demand, our neighbour in Ontario is restarting North America's only licensed cobalt refinery in conjunction with a significant $45 million investment by Glencore (Glencore Investment News). Fuse is excited that this refinery, once operational, will provide a nearby facility to refine any, and all, cobalt from the region. This is especially exciting for Fuse since we currently have three contractual arrangements with Glencore on our Ontario properties including an off-take agreement, a back-in rights agreement and a royalty agreement. If all goes as planned, we could be selling all our cobalt produced back to Glencore in the future, which is a huge benefit to Fuse shareholders.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecent News:\n\n* [https://fusecobalt.com/canadian-government-makes-joint-10-million-investment-in-cobalt-refineryadjoining-the-teledyne-and-glencore-bucke-property/](https://fusecobalt.com/canadian-government-makes-joint-10-million-investment-in-cobalt-refineryadjoining-the-teledyne-and-glencore-bucke-property/)\n* [https://fusecobalt.com/fuse-cobalt-to-investigate-potential-for-lithium-clay-deposits-at-teels-marsh-nevada/](https://fusecobalt.com/fuse-cobalt-to-investigate-potential-for-lithium-clay-deposits-at-teels-marsh-nevada/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPT: $1.2",

        "selftext": "Note: This company is valued at 10 Million when the Canadian Company alone invested 10 Million in it just last week!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is FUSEF: A cobalt exploration company, a mineral used in the EV battery tech\n\nWebsite: [https://fusecobalt.com/](https://fusecobalt.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMajor products:\n\nFuse Cobalt Inc. (formerly LiCo) has 100% ownership of two highly prospective cobalt properties located in the historical Cobalt Camp in Northern Ontario Canada. With the Teledyne and Glencore Bucke properties, Fuse is well positioned to move forward with cobalt focused exploration programs in line with the global trend toward zero emission electric vehicles powered by lithium ion battery technology where cobalt use is critical to stability and range. Highlights from 2017 drilling at Glencore Bucke included 8.42% cobalt in hole GB 17-15 over 0.3 m and at Teledyne, hole TE-1704 5.06% Co over 1.75 m (drill intersected width.) Fuse Cobalt Inc. is listed on the TSXV Venture Exchange under the symbol FUSE and in the U.S. on the OTCQB symbol FUSEF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy I think Fuse Cobalt will go up from here:\n\n1. 2018 drilling results on FUSE Ontario cobalt properties revealed Intersections of 21.9% Cobalt Over 0.36 M and 18.7% Cobalt Over 0.15 M at Teledyne Cobalt Property (News Release Jan 18, 2018), and Intersections of 8.42% Cobalt Over 0.30 Metres on the Glencore Bucke Property (News Release Jan 17, 2018). These are spectacular world class results!\n\n2. In 2020 FUSE added to their working capital and re-claimed 100% of their Canadian cobalt assets. They also added several experienced people to their team which will allow the Company to drive results on these two properties. There are plans to shore up management further in 2021 with new appointments.\n\n3. FUSE is now planning their 2021 Canadian exploration programs in Cobalt Ontario, and plan to further enhance and move their mineral exploration properties forward. The Company\u2019s exploration team is in the process of reviewing the past exploration work, to provide a realistic exploration plan for 2021. This will be announced shortly.\n\n4. FUSE neighbor in Ontario, First Cobalt is restarting North America\u2019s only licensed cobalt refinery, alongside an investment by mining and commodities trader giant Glencore of $45 million. Once operational it will provide a nearby facility to refine any and all cobalt from the region, especially since FUSE has an existing off-take agreement in place with Glencore on these very properties with one being a short 1500 meters away from the refining facility which is due to start processing feed in 2022.\n\n5. The Lithium Clay Deposits at Teels Marsh, Nevada which is under FUSE ownership. Lithium just like Cobalt is booming and FUSE can list both on its portfolio\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Fuse believes in the long-term cobalt commodity demand given that EV's are expected to number over 140 million vehicles by 2035, and each EV needs approximately 50 lbs of cobalt for its battery. Due to this heightened metal demand, our neighbour in Ontario is restarting North America's only licensed cobalt refinery in conjunction with a significant $45 million investment by Glencore (Glencore Investment News). Fuse is excited that this refinery, once operational, will provide a nearby facility to refine any, and all, cobalt from the region. This is especially exciting for Fuse since we currently have three contractual arrangements with Glencore on our Ontario properties including an off-take agreement, a back-in rights agreement and a royalty agreement. If all goes as planned, we could be selling all our cobalt produced back to Glencore in the future, which is a huge benefit to Fuse shareholders.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecent News:\n\n[https://fusecobalt.com/canadian-government-makes-joint-10-million-investment-in-cobalt-refineryadjoining-the-teledyne-and-glencore-bucke-property/](https://fusecobalt.com/canadian-government-makes-joint-10-million-investment-in-cobalt-refineryadjoining-the-teledyne-and-glencore-bucke-property/)\n\n[https://fusecobalt.com/fuse-cobalt-to-investigate-potential-for-lithium-clay-deposits-at-teels-marsh-nevada/](https://fusecobalt.com/fuse-cobalt-to-investigate-potential-for-lithium-clay-deposits-at-teels-marsh-nevada/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition: 194900 shares at 0.13",

        "selftext": "I've been in the telecommunications industry for many years, an investor for a few decades but mostly mfunds.  Wsb lurker.\n\nWhat I'm writing today about is my insights to broadband technology to the home. Not 5g, aapl or some shit. All the actual products that make your broadband work.\n\nHistory:\nBack in the day (15 to 20 years ago), your main vendors for dsl was alcatel, adtran, AFC/tellabs, the huge companies.\nCisco focused mostly on cable cmts platforms.\nCosts were very high and it was all capital in equipment spending. Profits were also high as anything other than dialup was worth the huge spend.\n \nI have seen dozens of vendors drop off the face of the earth for broadband such as copper mountain, teledyne, zhone (recently back in the picture but not much), pannaway, occam. Tellabs has fallen to an also ran and adtean also lags well behind in innovation and sales.\n\nIn the last few years the focus has been on fiber to the home which is basically the golden ticket.  Whoever gets there first in a city, wins the customers, spawning a huge race.\nCable is still very fast but DSL, even later versions is way too slow, and fiber is the end goal.\n\nI've used calix equipment for over 15 years and have watched it change from an equipment provider to a behemoth of marketing and monthly income.  Here's a short history to summarize:\n\n-calix has competing platform for vdsl, fiber and dial tone with occam networks.  They purchase occam for the platform, thereby merging two of the largest smaller companies into one. 2010.\n\n-calix purchases ericcsons fiber to the home tech in 2012\n\n-2015, calix focuses on moving things to the cloud using aws. They develop everything from management of the end user devices, customer cloud based app for their antivirus, wifi settings, etc.\nAlso a marketing app that pulls all the customer data, speeds, usage and allows providers to contact and upsell.  A complete ecosystem end to end not just an equipment provider.\n\n-calix becomes first ngpon2 supplier for 10 gigabit pon including signing a huge contract with Verizon a few years ago.\n\n-calix becomes the first mesh wifi provider for good in home wifi from ISP, including new wifi6 802.11ax. no other vendor has a wifi6 solution available.\n\nThat takes us up to where we are now.\nSo what's good going forward ?\n\n1) huawei/zte aren't used in north america much anymore as competition.   Bell canada used them a lot for LTE radios in cellular and for gpon fiber. They have been replaced with alcatel-lucent which is now called nokia.  Nokia costs a lot more, most companies do not use them.\n\n2) ceo and founder is Carl Russo, who also founded cerent before selling to cisco for a fortune. Several vp have come from bell canada, microsoft and at&amp;t and are well known experts in their field.\n\n3) sales and profits have been increasing every quarter for years,. Not pump and dump.\n\n4) manufacturing went to Vietnam in the wake of trump and chinese tariffs, so not affected by potential chinese relations with biden taking over.\n\n5) Covid19- the world is working from home, learning from home. This has caused all levels of government to provide massive subsidies and funding to build broadband to rural and semi rural areas where calix is the number one supplier.  With the monthly cloud subscriptions for managing all the customers it's not just sales, but ongoing revenue.\n\n6) they are hiring at a ridiculous pace. Their website has list to all postings.  \n\n7) the last few years and continuing are broadband initiatives i.e. \nhttps://www.calix.com/news-and-events/news-and-media-hub.html\n\n8) financial reports show good growth and ongoing sales trending upwards. Broadband growth continues to rise. Q4 announcements end of this month.\nStock has already gone up in price by 6x in 12 months.\nhttps://investor-relations.calix.com/home/default.aspx\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CALX/\n\nI don't own any stock, not saying it's a sure thing or pumping it.  I do think that they are still under valued and growing at a fast but steady rate.\nCheers.",
