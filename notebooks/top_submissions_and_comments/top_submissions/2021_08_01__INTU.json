        "selftext": "Hello, so I follow the [Kelly Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion), meaning that I yolo most of my money on plays that I have high conviction on. Since 90%+ of my portfolio is tied up in a play, I didn\u2019t plan on posting anything until after. However, some [SKIN calls recently paid off](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3oz2a/skin_side_bet_gains_4k_34k_all_shit_calls/) and now I have money now for a side bet. So I\u2019m going to introduce a stock that caught my eye. But, before I begin I want you all to watch this education video on how Hedge\u2019s take your money:\n\n[The Barclays Trading Strategy that Outperforms the Market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pYgz4YlQnE)\n\nSince I didn\u2019t release anything on NEGG until the [last second](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofojpw/whats_going_on_with_negg_a_ticker_with_35m_float/), and didn\u2019t have the time to write up a DD on SKIN before [the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3oz2a/skin_side_bet_gains_4k_34k_all_shit_calls/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), I wanted to change it up and inject some new blood into the pool. I have a theory that a lot of stocks on this sub are built on the backs of bagholders, so anytime I post a DD I want to make sure the setup is especially juicy and the calls cheap. Loss porn is cool and all, but it's depressing - I\u2019m looking at you [UPST bro](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3mhc0/upst_crash_update_how_to_lose_150k_in_3_days/), [I warned your ass to chill](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p1wt77/betting_80k_on_upst_crash_after_earnings/h8hug6f?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). \n\nThis isn\u2019t CLOV, AMC, WKHS, CLNE \u2014 **this is PAYA** a stock with juicy profit margins, crazy revenue growth, and an asymmetric gain opportunity in the short term because calls are cheap, with whales already jumping in slapping big dick energy down on OTM calls. \n\nEerily, this stock has not been mentioned on reddit or any of the regular places I check for mentions, even though they 1) [murked earnings and raised guidance](https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/08/22370953/paya-holdings-clocks-25-revenue-growth-in-q2-lifts-fy21-gross-margin-outlook), 2) [analysts keep upgrading their PTs](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PAYA/price-target/), 3) [announced on Friday a cashless redemption catalyst on Sep 10](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and), and 4) institutions are loaded to the tits with shares **(118%+)**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**This institutional share anomaly** will be deep dived later - but surprise surprise, since the institutions who **own all the shares are investment management firms who generally** buy and hold, the float is illiquid. Since, without an actively traded float there is essentially no float. Lastly as always there is a short angle for extra salt.\n\nWhen you read this DD remember the video I posted; people are watching  [\ud83d\udc40](https://emojipedia.org/eyes/), so take profits this time and cut your losses if you FOMO in at the last second. I wouldn\u2019t be posting or throwing money down on calls unless I had a good amount of conviction that this pays out.\n\n**Here\u2019s the tldr summary for what\u2019s up**\n\n* **Solid financials.** Ex: 52% gross profit margins (Square is 28%) \n* **Near-100% institutional holdings** (equals highly restricted float)\n* **Major warrant dilution cancellation** catalyst (Sep 10)\n* **Multiple** **major valuations** at a 60% upside. \n* **IV is dirt poor** at 40% . \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 1 About + Financials \n\nPAYA is a payment processor that has done close to $35bn in payments in 2020, projected $40bn in 2021 and is growing at a fast pace. They work through vendors, resellers, independent sales organizations, developers, etc, etc, etc., and have a bunch of different offerings depending on the sector of business, while their projected upward revenue is intense.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nPaya has the lowest price per sales of all its competitors at 5.0 (SHOP is at 48.67 and INTU at 16.51). Gross profit margins are insane at 50.9%, compared to 23.2% for Square (SQ), and 48.4% of Paypal (PYPL). In fact, PAYA has the highest Institutional ownership of all competitors and the highest short interest. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nCaption: competitors analyzed: SQ, PYPL, INTU, SHOP, FISV, PSFE\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to deep dive into, but it\u2019s solid company. So solid that institutions are picking up as many shares of PAYA as possible. [Their recent Q2 ER presentation](https://investors.paya.com/static-files/3769846b-2d2c-4e7a-946f-5b25b6911e93) showed off their stellar earnings growth. It\u2019s hard to name other companies with permanent relevancy that have **over a 50% gross profit margin**. \n\nCouple highlights\n\n* $135mil of cash on hand\n* $244mil revenue expected in 2021\n* 25% revenue growth year-over-year realized and projected\n* 42% gross profit margin growth year-over-year realized and projected\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSince the economy has reopened, PAYA\u2019s profit margins have only been growing. Unlike most tech companies, they are not a one-and-done situation but will have permanent relevancy in the post-Covid world. In fact, they are a top-20 payment provider in the US. \n\n[BTIG](https://www.investing.com/news/btig-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-paya-holdings-2439931), [Truist](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/06/21740210/truist-securities-initiates-coverage-on-paya-holdings-with-buy-rating-announces-price-target-of-15), [Cannacord](https://m.investing.com/news/canaccord-genuity-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-paya-holdings-2344676), and [Credit Suisse](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/05/20983489/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-paya-holdings-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target-of-1) have all given PAYA bullish targets with an average 56% upside. Meanwhile, institutions have just been pouring into this stock and buying more while increasing price targets. \n\n# Part 2 Institutional Holdings: +128% \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOkay, so this is getting good. So institutions obviously can\u2019t hold more than 100% of shares - this is probably a small error in delayed reporting and maybe some brokers miscounting a handful of tranche locked up shares. \n\n**However** **it is very likely that institutions hold near-100% of all shares**. The entire volume over the last 6 weeks since Q2 reporting was only 28 million shares. The largest holder, GTCR didn\u2019t sell a share, Blackrock bought 150% more, and every single other major institution holder that reported for Q2 so far **increased** their positions.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that institutions and funds think this is a valuable AF company and they are holding nearly all outstanding shares. They are jacked. **And remember: if nearly all outstanding shares are being held by institutions**, **that means the effective float is tiny**. This is very important in relation to short interest**.** \n\nFiguring out just how small the float is relevant to figuring out what kind of corner shorts have put themselves in. Luckily we have some good pieces of info to guide us-\n\n* [PAYA tells us](https://investors.paya.com/static-files/3769846b-2d2c-4e7a-946f-5b25b6911e93#page=10) there are 121mil shares outstanding in their recent ER. \n* [13Fs/Ds tell us](https://fintel.io/so/us/paya) that most institutions are holding and only small funds are trading in and out. \n* [FINRA tells us](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/paya/short-interest) that ***there are 7.2mil outstanding S***I. \n* [Price tells us](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-PAYA/) that only 28mil shares were traded in the last 6 weeks since June 30 Q2 reports have been filed with only a net 2.1mil share sell.\n\n**If nearly all shares are held by institutions,** then obviously the float is highly restricted. Since we know the exact number of shorts via FINRA, we can figure out real short interest in relation to the float at different institutional holding levels.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAfter all my time in highly illiquid stocks like NEGG and others that can\u2019t be named, it\u2019s obvious PAYA\u2019s float is super tight, and it seems pretty plausible institutional holdings are likely around the 90% range, if not higher. **This would correlate to a 60%-118% short percentage of the effective float.**\n\nAdditionally, from the FTD viewpoint you see a spike in [FTDs with the price bleeding up](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=paya). To me this indicates tight short constraints, and combining with what we already know leads me to the belief that there may be a supply issue. SI doesn\u2019t have to be balls to the wall for it to matter, sometimes supply-side issues are there but not reflected in the raw SI data. \n\nI guarantee these shorts don\u2019t realize that their positions are ticking time bombs due to the illiquid nature of the stock. They probably don\u2019t even have a fundamentally negative view of the company and are just actively trading in and out of the stock. Spoiler: it won\u2019t end well \n\n# Part 3 Canceled. Warrant dilution\n\nA lot of negative price sentiment came from market pricing in an 18mil eventual share dilution via warrant exercises. This would have been a -**15% share dilution** of current shareholders.\n\n[Surprise](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and). \n\nTurns out PAYA is doing well enough that they are **forgoing $200 million** to protect share value by buying back their warrants. This is pending a vote due on Sep 10 where they already have 63.5% of \u201cyes\u201d votes. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with the process here, I\u2019ll explain. Since PAYA was originally a SPAC, it has warrants. A warrant is basically a call option with a strike price of $11.50 and a 5 year term. [As stated in their S1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001819881/000121390020035622/fs12020_payaholdings.htm), PAYA originally issued 17.7mil warrants (which would eventually dilute into the stock), however last week [they dropped the news](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and) that they would be calling for a \u201ccashless redemption\u201d of the warrants at a ratio of .26 shares per warrant, and changing the dilution from the long established 17.7mil to 4.6mil. \n\nThis is bullish because \n\n1. PAYA is saying they don\u2019t need the cash (the 17.7mil warrants exercised would have brought them $204mil) \n2. Instead of the float being diluted by 17.7mil shares, there will now be only 4.6mil shares issued. **This is a positive change of +11% which the market has not priced in.**\n3. The warrants don\u2019t have an upward cap, and can be bought as high as wanted in relation to the stock.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 4 The Short and Long Play\n\n**Fair value is** **at least $16.65** based on analyst coverage, warrant cashless redemption, and fundamental growth profit margins [growing at 42% YoY](https://investors.paya.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-q/0001819881-21-000035). They provide services that are growing exponentially and will remain in high demand for decades + their stock has received a ridiculous number of valuations all 46% higher than current valuation **before the warrant redemption news hit**. \n\nThere is still an immediate need for the market to react to the warrant redemption. Upside is at least 11% - from current $10.21 to $11.33 just on the news Friday alone (PSA - the options market has not priced this in at all yet) not even factoring in their massive revenue guidance, short coverings, or other catalysts they have lined up.\n\n**9/20 10c @ .60 = 733% returns at $11.33 by Sep 10** \n\n**9/20 12.5c @ .10 = 2400% returns at $15 by Sep 10**\n\n**11/15 15c @ .15 = 1800% returns at $17.5 in October**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 5 Options Flow\n\n1K+ Flow \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 6 Position\n\n\ud83d\udcf7",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 23, 2021**\n\nStocks rebounded today, rising to fresh records after last week\u2019s volatility as fears surrounding a potential taper timeline, as alluded by the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting minute, receded. Like I said last week, I viewed the dip following the meeting minutes as another overreaction by the market. To reiterate, I remain very bullish moving forward until the Federal Reserve starts to discuss a potential interest rate hike, which I expect in late 2022-early 2023. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday. In my opinion, he likely will not reveal any additional details regarding a potential taper timeline in order to avoid another taper tantrum. ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:\\~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program)).\n\nLast week, equities came under pressure after the Fed\u2019s July meeting minutes, which said \u201clooking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.\u201dAs I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed\u2019s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, \u201c most participants judged that the Committee\u2019s standard of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.\u201d \n\nIn order to stave off another \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to \u201creaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.\u201d Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities.\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US Federal Drug Association (FDA) officially approved Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech\u2019s (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine. Until now, it was administered under emergency use authorization. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is likely to be approved in the next few days as well. Stock of vaccine-makers were higher. \n* Shares of cancer-research company Trillium Therapeutics (TRIL) were up 188% after Pfizer (PFE) acquired them for $2.26 billion. Andy Schmeltz, President of Pfizer Oncology said, \u201cThe proposed acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in Oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe\u201d.\n* Existing home sales unexpectedly rose in July, marking consecutive monthly gains. According to the National Association of Realtors, existing home sales rose 2%, compared to a 0.5% dip expected. \n* Ford Motors (F) has doubled its production target for the new F-150 Lightning pick-up truck due to strong early demand. The company now has a target of producing 80,000 in 2024, up from its previous target of 40,000.\n* Target (TGT) announced it planned to triple the number of Disney (DIS) shops within its stores by year's end. Target started hosting these Disney \u201cshop in a shop\u201d locations in 2019.\n* Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit said Boeing Co. will invest in the satellite-launching startup's planned $3.2 billion merger-listing later this year, an investment that comes as the plane maker's own space program faces hurdles. Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) are still reeling following Branson\u2019s flight a few weeks ago.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by Cowen from $120 to $130 at Outperform. Stock currently around $120\n* Abbott Labs (ABT) target raised by Cowen from $125 to $140 at Outperform. Stock currently around $126\n* Albemarle (ALB) target raised by Loop Capital from $208 to $253 at Buy. Stock currently around $228\n* Burlington Stores (BURL) target raised by Telsey Advisory Group from $380 to $400 at Outperform. Stock currently around $343\n* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Barclays from $285 to $291 at Overweight. Stock currently around $260\n* John Deere (DE) target raised by Credit Suisse from $430 to $440 at Outperform. Stock currently around $362\n* Intuit (INTU) with two target raises. Stock currently around $553\n   * Jefferies Financial from $525 to $630 at Buy\n   * Barclays from $540 to $645 at Overweight\n* MongoDB (MDB) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $390 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $377\n* Ulta Beauty (ULTA) target raised by Piper Sandler from $386 to $405 at Overweight. Stock currently around $371\n\n\u201cThe fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.\u201d - Shakespeare",

        "selftext": "I posted [my July earnings trading report](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/ov71vv/my_july_earnings_report/) last month, and many of you were kind enough to share your thoughts with me.\n\nTLDR: My July results were almost a scratch, $93 into a positive column, and I was undecided if trading earnings is a worthwhile thing.\n\nFast forward to the end of August\u2026 I couldn\u2019t keep away from earnings, just love trading them.\n\nHere are my August stats:\n\n* 21 earnings trades (short condors and strangles, all small positions, average BPu $532.85 per position)\n* 19 wins and 2 losses. A win rate - 90%. Better than July\u2019s 77%. A little experience helps!\n* My wins brought in $567.68\n* Losses took away $104.00\n* Net profit $463.68.\n\nWins: ABNB, BBY, CRM, CSCO, DASH, GPS, HPQ, INTU, M, MRVL, NVDA, PTON, SNOW, SPLK, TGT, TJX, ULTA, URBN, WDC\n\nLosses: LOW, JWN\n\nThe wins are great - no doubt. But it is the losses that are really interesting and have a high learning value. My losses show my indecision between two lines of thought: to defend a losing trade or to exit ASAP to minimize the loss. I have seen convincing arguments for both approaches, and am not yet sure where I stand on this.\n\nI managed my losing LOW trade fairly well in the beginning, brought it from several hundred down to around $30 loss. I could have brought it to a win, but I made a mistake - misread where I was standing and exited for a small loss. I learned how to read the position correctly and did another losing trade right - turned it into a win.\n\nI decided to take a loss on JWN because my overall win rate for August was around 93% and I thought I could afford a small loss. But now I think it could\u2019ve been managed and perhaps turned. But we\u2019ll never know if it could and if I had the skill to do it.\n\nWhere do you stand on this question? Do you defend? Or take a loss and move on to the next trade?",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, August 25, 2021**\n\nStocks continued their momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again reaching intraday record highs. It seems market participants have looked past the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting minutes, which included language signaling that tapering may begin sooner rather than later, and continue to digest Q2 record-breaking earnings season and new developments coming out of Washington D.C. Looking ahead, market participants await Fed Chair Jerome Powell annual Jackson Hole speech, scheduled this Friday morning.\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\nUS Crude oil prices continued gaining, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.\n\nEnergy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine. U.S. crude oil prices have so far risen 39% for the year-to-date.\n\nYesterday, The House of Representatives voted to adopt a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, taking a major step toward enacting President Biden\u2019s ambitious economic agenda that calls for increased spending on education, health care and renewable energy. The 220-212 vote, which fell along partisan lines, was originally delayed after a group of moderate Democrats said they would not approve the budget until the infrastructure bill was voted on. \n\nFollowing the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, \u201cPassing an infrastructure bill is always exciting for what it means in terms of jobs and commerce in our country.\u201d President Biden thanked every member of the House, saying, \u201cThere were differences. Strong points of view. They\u2019re always welcome. What\u2019s important is that we came together to advance our agenda.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve's virtual Jackson Hole Symposium, which kicks off on Thursday. After last week's July Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes came off as more hawkish than many market participants were expecting, more clues on the path forward for monetary policy remain a key focal point. Namely, traders are looking to see whether central bank officials signal when they will announce and implement tapering of pandemic-era quantitative easing.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Mortgage applications unexpectedly rose, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Overall applications were up 1.6% during the week ended August 20, following a drop of 3.9% during the previous week. Home purchases led the advances, with these rising 3% week-on-week on a seasonally adjusted basis to reach the highest level since early July.\n* Western Digital (WDC) is in advanced talks to merge with Japanese semiconductor company Kioxia in a deal valued roughly $20 billion.\n* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued absolutely beasting, which makes me so happy. As I have said before, NVDA is by far my favorite stock in the market.\n* President Joe Biden called cybersecurity a \"core national security challenge\" in a meeting with leaders from Silicon Valley, the water and energy sectors, the banking and insurance industries and academic institutions on Wednesday to discuss [shoring up the nation's cybersecurity.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/cybersecurity-executive-order/index.html) IMO cybersecurity stocks are a great place to look into for future value.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with a host of target raises.

They are cloud based and do IA setup for accounting/financials. I have traded this in the past but below 60 a little over a year ago. Does anyone have any ideas what is going on? I am thinking of shorting this\u2026 ideas?\n\nIf you take a look at form 4 for CEO, the CFO, general council and the secretary are selling shares! They were even selling 100 dollars below the 283 close Friday.\n\nIt took INTU many years to be a 27 billion dollar company.. They actually missed estimates with a loss of 7 cents missing by 3 cents. Revenue was 78 million growth of 86%... Not earnings were 78 million, sales! They lost 6.2 million on these sales. The forecast for the year is to lose 10-20 million dollars\u2026.\n\nThe outlook on the next quarter is a loss of 3-5 million.. This is a 27 billion dollar company that even sees full next years sales at 476 to 480 million. They are expected to lose 88-92 cents a share that\u2019s about 75 million\u2026.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.\n\n# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep \u2018taper talk\u2019 going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n*****\n&gt; The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed chairman\u2019s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. \u201cI don\u2019t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don\u2019t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed and markets\nBut the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; There could be some volatility around the Fed\u2019s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for Powell, \u201che\u2019s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he\u2019s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there\u2019s a lot of it,\u201d said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.\n*****\n&gt; The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.\n*****\n&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There\u2019s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,\u201d said Swonk. \u201cThey want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they\u2019re not hitting the brakes. They\u2019re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTo avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cIf this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we\u2019re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they\u2019re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sxTwppT.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/XaZ3OqE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oLHqqFQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/iuH4ig1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/lflLJO1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7JLtvgO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cnmvI5A.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Cqw6DkJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QeyCpqJ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wLwUeqE.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4izjE1a.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/k1m7sYO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year\n\n&gt; Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In post-election years, September\u2019s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # US Dollar Breaks Out\n\n&gt; After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims\n\n&gt; Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**\n\n&gt; While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA-Share.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss\n\n&gt; Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png))**\n\n&gt; While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png))**\n\n&gt; Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-3.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 20th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.22.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$JD $CRM $BBY $PTON $SNOW $XPEV $DKS $PDD $MDT $ANF $AAP $DG $EXPR $MRVL $ULTA $PANW $ITRN $DLTR $INTU $MSGE $MARK $COTY $WDAY $JWN $SPLK $CTRN $BURL $GPS $ADSK $MOMO $FLWS $BMO $URBN $BOX $SAFM $HPQ $HTHT $WSM $TOL $TD $BNS $DELL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YupEtZ9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/bge25NW.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eKNfaOS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Nsf4OKr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  8.24.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xfr0NjU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5Ly7VHw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OFpxuOX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8uM0FGq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/drMyySB.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.26.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7Hr5nKX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLkiAvx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.27.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # JD.com, Inc. $63.62\n**JD.com, Inc.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, August 25, 2021**\n\nStocks continued their momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again reaching intraday record highs. It seems market participants have looked past the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting minutes, which included language signaling that tapering may begin sooner rather than later, and continue to digest Q2 record-breaking earnings season and new developments coming out of Washington D.C. Looking ahead, market participants await Fed Chair Jerome Powell annual Jackson Hole speech, scheduled this Friday morning.\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\nUS Crude oil prices continued gaining, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.\n\nEnergy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine. U.S. crude oil prices have so far risen 39% for the year-to-date.\n\nYesterday, The House of Representatives voted to adopt a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, taking a major step toward enacting President Biden\u2019s ambitious economic agenda that calls for increased spending on education, health care and renewable energy. The 220-212 vote, which fell along partisan lines, was originally delayed after a group of moderate Democrats said they would not approve the budget until the infrastructure bill was voted on. \n\nFollowing the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, \u201cPassing an infrastructure bill is always exciting for what it means in terms of jobs and commerce in our country.\u201d President Biden thanked every member of the House, saying, \u201cThere were differences. Strong points of view. They\u2019re always welcome. What\u2019s important is that we came together to advance our agenda.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve's virtual Jackson Hole Symposium, which kicks off on Thursday. After last week's July Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes came off as more hawkish than many market participants were expecting, more clues on the path forward for monetary policy remain a key focal point. Namely, traders are looking to see whether central bank officials signal when they will announce and implement tapering of pandemic-era quantitative easing.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Mortgage applications unexpectedly rose, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Overall applications were up 1.6% during the week ended August 20, following a drop of 3.9% during the previous week. Home purchases led the advances, with these rising 3% week-on-week on a seasonally adjusted basis to reach the highest level since early July.\n* Western Digital (WDC) is in advanced talks to merge with Japanese semiconductor company Kioxia in a deal valued roughly $20 billion.\n* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued absolutely beasting, which makes me so happy. As I have said before, NVDA is by far my favorite stock in the market.\n* President Joe Biden called cybersecurity a \"core national security challenge\" in a meeting with leaders from Silicon Valley, the water and energy sectors, the banking and insurance industries and academic institutions on Wednesday to discuss [shoring up the nation's cybersecurity.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/cybersecurity-executive-order/index.html) IMO cybersecurity stocks are a great place to look into for future value.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with a host of target raises. Average price target $240 at Outperform. Stock currently around $212\n* Affirm (AFRM) target raised by Bank of America from $71 to $82 at Buy. Stock currently around $72\n* Best Buy (BBY) with two target raises. Stock currently around $121\n   * Jefferies Financial from $136 to $145 at Buy\n   * Telsey Advisory Group from $140 to $150 at Outperform\n* Digital Realty Trust (DLR) target raised by Barclays from $177 to $178 at Overweight. Stock currently around $159\n* Intuit (INTU) with a host of target raises. Average price target $650 at Buy. Stock currently around $557\n* Marvell Technology (MRVL) target asied by Susquehanna from $64 to $72 at Positive. Stock currently around $63\n* Pinduoduo (PDD) target raised by Bank of America from $143 to $148 at Buy. Stock currently around $97\n\n\u201cIt is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it\u201d - Aristotle",

I actually bought them at $15 last week with the plan to hold all the way through earnings, but then we had a spooky red day and I sold them at cost the next morning when they rebounded. Finally just caved and bought back in yesterday afternoon at market order ($27). Set a limit order to sell at $40, but it ran right through and executed at $47.\n\nThe ticker is currently just about flat on the day, so I must have hit the absolute peak when I sold. I had a limit order in to buy another $10k in $560 strikes, too, but came up about a dollar short on those bids.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 23, 2021**\n\nStocks rebounded today, rising to fresh records after last week\u2019s volatility as fears surrounding a potential taper timeline, as alluded by the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting minute, receded. Like I said last week, I viewed the dip following the meeting minutes as another overreaction by the market. To reiterate, I remain very bullish moving forward until the Federal Reserve starts to discuss a potential interest rate hike, which I expect in late 2022-early 2023. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday. In my opinion, he likely will not reveal any additional details regarding a potential taper timeline in order to avoid another taper tantrum. ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:\\~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp#:~:text=Taper%20tantrum%20refers%20to%20the,quantitative%20easing%20(QE)%20program)).\n\nLast week, equities came under pressure after the Fed\u2019s July meeting minutes, which said \u201clooking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.\u201dAs I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed\u2019s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, \u201c most participants judged that the Committee\u2019s standard of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.\u201d \n\nIn order to stave off another \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to \u201creaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.\u201d Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities.\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US Federal Drug Association (FDA) officially approved Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech\u2019s (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine. Until now, it was administered under emergency use authorization. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is likely to be approved in the next few days as well. Stock of vaccine-makers were higher. \n* Shares of cancer-research company Trillium Therapeutics (TRIL) were up 188% after Pfizer (PFE) acquired them for $2.26 billion. Andy Schmeltz, President of Pfizer Oncology said, \u201cThe proposed acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in Oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe\u201d.\n* Existing home sales unexpectedly rose in July, marking consecutive monthly gains. According to the National Association of Realtors, existing home sales rose 2%, compared to a 0.5% dip expected. \n* Ford Motors (F) has doubled its production target for the new F-150 Lightning pick-up truck due to strong early demand. The company now has a target of producing 80,000 in 2024, up from its previous target of 40,000.\n* Target (TGT) announced it planned to triple the number of Disney (DIS) shops within its stores by year's end. Target started hosting these Disney \u201cshop in a shop\u201d locations in 2019.\n* Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit said Boeing Co. will invest in the satellite-launching startup's planned $3.2 billion merger-listing later this year, an investment that comes as the plane maker's own space program faces hurdles. Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) are still reeling following Branson\u2019s flight a few weeks ago.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by Cowen from $120 to $130 at Outperform. Stock currently around $120\n* Abbott Labs (ABT) target raised by Cowen from $125 to $140 at Outperform. Stock currently around $126\n* Albemarle (ALB) target raised by Loop Capital from $208 to $253 at Buy.

Stock currently around $343\n* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Barclays from $285 to $291 at Overweight. Stock currently around $260\n* John Deere (DE) target raised by Credit Suisse from $430 to $440 at Outperform. Stock currently around $362\n* Intuit (INTU) with two target raises. Stock currently around $553\n   * Jefferies Financial from $525 to $630 at Buy\n   * Barclays from $540 to $645 at Overweight\n* MongoDB (MDB) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $390 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $377\n* Ulta Beauty (ULTA) target raised by Piper Sandler from $386 to $405 at Overweight. Stock currently around $371\n\n\u201cThe fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.\u201d - Shakespeare",
