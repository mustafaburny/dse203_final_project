        "selftext": "For example, why not just buy a long-term call option (an actual good legitimate proven company that\u2019s clearly poised for more growth such as MSFT or VISA) that expires January 2021 with the closest strike price from the current share price? Yes, the option price is going to be expensive but assuming you have somewhat of a significant capital to play with (let\u2019s say at least 30 grand or beyond), wouldn\u2019t it be relatively easy to rack in $1000+ profits once your strike price hits or it goes above? Why don\u2019t more people do this as there\u2019s very very minimal risk to it? \n\nFor example, let\u2019s say I buy a MSFT call option that expires January 15th 2021 with the price per option being roughly $13.43 and I buy 22 contracts (x 100), which would equate to about $29,5400. I can bet my fingers, toes, and testicles that MSFT will reach $195 SOMETIME before January 15th 2021 (They say only death and taxes are guaranteed, but come on, let\u2019s be real, this is a guarantee). Fine, worst case scenario, let\u2019s say it takes another 1-2 months for MSFT to reach $195 \u2013 still, if I wait 1-2 months and it\u2019s at $198, I\u2019ll still make over $9K, which I\u2019ll be very happy with. Is this not a viable strategy if you have the capital? Why don\u2019t more people just risk more capital on long term call options with the closest strike price from the current price? Am I missing something here? If I understand correctly, you can hold your position for as long as you can before the expiration date and sell whenever you want once MSFT reaches $195+.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 17th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks expected to rise even as virus creates volatility: \u2018The market thinks the worst is over\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/stocks-expected-to-rise-even-as-virus-creates-volatility-the-market-thinks-the-worst-is-over.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are likely to remain hostage to developments involving the coronavirus in the week ahead, and even so, the market could continue to hit new highs.\n*****\n&gt; Economists have been reducing China\u2019s growth outlook for the quarter, with some seeing little or no growth and then a bounce back in the high single digits next quarter. The U.S. economy is not expected to take a big hit, but the question for the stock market is how will corporate earnings be impacted.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt does feel as though the market thinks the worst is over,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe pace of change is slowing. None of us really know, and there\u2019s a lot of skepticism, including in Washington that they can\u2019t believe what\u2019s coming out of China.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Keon believes the market looks poised to head higher and it is trading as if the virus will not make a big dent in the economy or profits. \u201cThe market didn\u2019t really get much of a drawback, compared to SARS or other episodes. There\u2019s no doubt he world will suffer a hit over the first and second quarter and maybe longer,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Companies reporting earnings in the coming week include Walmart Tuesday; ViacomCBS Thursday, and Deere on Friday. Hyatt Hotels reports Wednesday, and Norwegian Cruise Lines reports Thursday. Economic releases include Tuesday\u2019s Empire State and Thursday\u2019s Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys, as well as Markit PMI on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; There are also a parade of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.\n*****\n&gt; # Profit warnings\n&gt; Some companies are already raising warnings, like Cisco which said orders were down and that the forward-looking numbers were not factoring in potential supply chain disruptions. Nvidia said it would take a $100 million hit from the virus, but its revenue forecast was still above expectations.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour said its sales will be impacted by the virus, when it projected disappointing revenue growth this week. Estee Lauder said its sales will be hit by a decline in travel-related luxury sales.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is going to start to show up because it will affect supply chains\u201d and exporters, said Keon. \u201cIt will have a negative impact. But at the moment, at least, it doesn\u2019t look like it will be a huge deal to companies in the U.S...It will be a factor. The question is, is it a lasting factor that will hurt them through the year, or is it a quarter or two and then gets back to normal. None of us know.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 64,000 people, mostly in China, have been infected and about 1,400 have died from the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research, said he sees only a minor impact on U.S. corporate earnings.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere will be some hits in some of the consumer companies that have reasonably big businesses in China. I see this as being a fairly small effect on the U.S.,\u201d Knapp said. He said the disruption to the supply chain should not be nearly as bad as it was when Japan was hit by a tsunami and earthquake in 2011.\n*****\n&gt; He expects stocks to continue to move higher, ending the year higher, but he says the market could run into turbulence in the spring when the Fed discusses cutting back its purchases of Treasury bills.\n*****\n&gt; For now, the Fed asset purchases, a strong U.S. consumer and the positive benefit to business spending from the trade deal should help drive stocks higher. But by April or May, the Fed could become a negative. \u201cCould we go up another 3 or 4% between now and then? Sure, we could,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said since World War II, market corrections fanned by Fed policy changes have resulted in brief pullbacks, averaging about 8%. He said the market should then rebound. \u201cIt trades in a range for a quarter or two and then resumes its uptrend,\u201d he said, noting the uptrend could coincide with the presidential election this year.\n*****\n&gt; # Resilient market\n&gt; Even with the negative news and doubts about the virus, analysts say the market has the momentum to move higher. But Robert Sluymer, technical analyst with Fundstrat, said the market may stay range bound for awhile until there\u2019s more clarity on the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI had a 3,340 to 3,360 [on the S&amp;P 500] as the point where the market starts to consolidate, and we\u2019re there,\u201d said Sluymer. \u201cI don\u2019t have a year-end target but I think it\u2019s higher. I think we\u2019re in a sloppy range. I think it\u2019s range bound.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Sluymer also said he thinks the market is just pausing. \u201cStocks are consolidating above support. The market is acting incredibly resilient and it still looks like an intermediate term pause, a consolidation,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said he\u2019s looking for more gains though the market will continue to be swung by virus-related headlines. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to work its way higher, not at the pace you saw last year. But that\u2019s the way we have our portfolios positioned \u2014 the market will work its way higher this year,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zGXae0P.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZsVPAZO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DE2dIMR.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/iGBF28x.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rMe9946.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ps9FL8g.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C48fTcF.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lJgq8up.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j9w4IR8.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKn6MfJ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/A3rPbpC.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QLBnp9J.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SfzBNHl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# February Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 Up 12 of Last 14\n\n&gt; February\u2019s option expiration day has been down more often than not over the past 26 years with an average loss of 0.20% for S&amp;P 500.

But stocks have taken off in February, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 4% this month, as US economic data remains strong and fears over the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus appear overblown.\n\n&gt; Historically, February has been a month when stocks tend to take a bit of a break. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has been flat, on average, during the second month of an election year. What is most interesting, though, is how weak October has been historically leading up to presidential elections, yet how strong stocks have been in November and December as political uncertainty clears following elections.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-500-index-average-monthly-returns-during-an-election-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Maybe the big gains so far this month shouldn\u2019t be a total surprise? \u201cYes, February historically has been a troublesome month for stocks,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cYet over the past decade, no month has seen better returns.\u201d In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2.34% on average in February over the past decade, compared with the second best month of October\u2019s gain of 2.29%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/february-is-usually-weak-but-has-been-the-best-month-the-past-10-years.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Record Pace of Records\n\n&gt; Let's preface this with the fact that it's still early in the year and the rest of the year is unlikely to closely follow the path we have seen so far, but the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace for its 11th record closing high this year. While we're just 29 trading days into the year, in the post-WWII period, 2020 already ranks as the 33rd highest number of record closing highs for the S&amp;P 500 in a given year (out of 76). What's even more notable, though, is that at the current pace the S&amp;P 500 would have 96 record closes this year, which would dwarf the total from every other year. For reference, the highest number of record closing highs in a given year was 77 in 1995, and there are only four other years (1961, 1964, 2014, and 2017) where there were more than 50 record closes.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Continues to Gain Share of World Market Cap\n\n&gt; The United States dominates the rest of the world in terms of its share of total equity market capitalization. Currently, US stocks make up over 40% of global equities' total market cap. No other country comes even close to this size with the next largest country being China with just 8.47% and then Japan with 7.09%. Hong Kong is the only other individual county with a share larger than 5%. While France is the largest European Union country stock market in terms of the percentage of world market cap at only 3%, the total share of all EU countries shown sits at over 10%. Former EU member, the United Kingdon, is also one of the larger countries but has consistently lost share over the past decade. So far this year it has lost another 0.2%.\n\n&gt; One interesting change that we noted at the end of last year has been the massive increase in Saudi Arabia's share thanks to one of the world's largest companies, Saudi Aramco, hitting public markets. Although it has led to a massive jump over the long run, since the start of the year Saudi Arabia's share of market cap has fallen 14 bps likely due to Saudi Aramco being a one-way trade lower off of its highs that were put in place only a few days after its IPO. Meanwhile, the US has taken another 1.17% of the world's market cap in 2020 alone.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/World-Market-Cap2.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are several individual countries that are actually outperforming the US so far in 2020, generally speaking, the US has outperformed the rest of the world which is why the US has taken more market cap this year. Whereas the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.93% YTD as of yesterday's close, MSCI's World Index excluding the US is just about flat. That trend of US outperformance has been in place for much of the past year well before the coronavirus hit Asia in December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RS-ROW.png))**\n\n&gt; Another interesting country to note is China. 2020 has been off to a rocky start thanks to the coronavirus. This had sent the country's share of global market cap plummeting down to ~8% on February 3rd. That was its lowest level since February of last year. But as this month has progressed and the situation surrounding the virus has improved, China has regained some of those losses and is now sitting with a larger share of world market cap than it ended 2019 with.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/China-Percent.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Things Are Looking Up\n\n&gt; Stocks had their best week in 8 months last week, as the worst of the coronavirus fears subsided and the US economy showed some impressive resolve. Last, the LPL Strategists discuss why international stocks could finally be close to having their time in the sun after lagging the US for much of the past decade.\n\n&gt; # DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE LOOKING BETTER\n&gt; Developed markets have lagged the US for more than 10 years now. Although we aren\u2019t ready to fully invest in these areas, we are starting to see signs to warm up to international equites. As the LPL Strategists discuss, values are historically cheap relative to the US, global growth is stabilizing, growth leadership my start to weaken, and the US dollar should be pressured lower. Should any of those four reasons begin to take place, it could create a nice tailwind for international stocks.\n\n&gt; # THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\n&gt; Equity markets bounced nicely last week, as fears over the coronavirus appear to be calming. The loss of lives is devastating, but markets are focusing on this fast spreading, yet low death rate of this virus versus other dangerous outbreaks. The LPL Strategists noted that China could very well see flat GDP growth in Q1, a big pick up later in 2020 could be likely. Additionally, don\u2019t forget that the US economy actually got stronger during the SARS outbreak in 2003.\n\n&gt; # SOME MORE GOOD NEWS\n&gt; Further supporting stocks last week was a trio of solid economic data in the US. The jobs report in January showed a very solid 225,000 jobs created, well above expectations. Additionally, much better than expected manufacturing data and solid services data show an economy that continues to defy the naysayers. Last, productivity in Q4 bounced and for the year it was the highest nonfarm productivity since 2010.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/images/Article_Page/WMC_02102020_1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another \"Delay\" in the Value Trade\n\n&gt; How many times over the last few years have you heard something to the tune of \"The time for value stocks to outperform is now.\" Well, we're still waiting. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index going back to 1995. A quick warning: if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to skip the chart altogether.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-Value-vs-Growth.png))**\n\n&gt; From 1995 right up to the bull market peak in 2000, value stocks couldn't catch a break as they steadily underperformed growth stocks. Those were the days when Energy as a sector was 'dead' and investors couldn't get enough of tech IPOs with trendy sounding names. The low for value stocks on a relative basis came on 3/27/00, and from there the reversal was swift. By April of 2001, value stocks had regained nearly all of the ground they lost relative to growth during the late 1990s. Unfortunately for investors in both types of strategies, the outperformance in value wasn't the result of a monster rally, but instead a massive decline in growth stocks.\n\n&gt; From April 2001 through late 2002, value stocks underperformed again as the Worldcom and Enron accounting scandals cast a pall over sectors like Telecom Services and Utilities - two sectors traditionally comprised predominantly by value stocks. As the dust settled on those two scandals, though, and the economy stabilized, value stocks rallied again as Energy, Financials, and Materials stocks boomed.\n\n&gt; As the Financial sector began to unravel in 2007 and oil prices peaked in 2008, value stocks once again cratered relative to growth. Growth has maintained its lead over value ever since. Outside of some periods where value stocks briefly popped and strategist after strategist came out and said this time the rally is for real, growth stocks have left value stocks in the dust. Just last year, the underperformance of value stocks marked a major milestone as they took out their lows in relative strength versus growth stocks. While the S&amp;P 500 Value Index saw a modest bounce towards the end of last year, any momentum it had has quickly been erased in 2020 as the ratio between it and the S&amp;P 500 Growth index is now at fresh lows.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 14th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.16.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP2aL-EGRQg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$WMT** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$AAP** \n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$ENPH** \n&gt; * **$INMD** \n&gt; * **$TRU** \n&gt; * **$WAB** \n&gt; * **$AEIS** \n&gt; * **$WING** \n&gt; * **$BHC** \n&gt; * **$VMC** \n&gt; * **$GRMN** \n&gt; * **$LDOS** \n&gt; * **$TSEM** \n&gt; * **$ECL** \n&gt; * **$ALLE** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$OLED** \n&gt; * **$DBX** \n&gt; * **$NXRT** \n&gt; * **$BLMN** \n&gt; * **$ATH** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$FANG** \n&gt; * **$CEQP** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$FLR** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$VG** \n&gt; * **$SIX** \n&gt; * **$A** \n&gt; * **$CHH** \n&gt; * **$SEDG** \n&gt; * **$NVTA** \n&gt; * **$IMAX** \n&gt; * **$AG** \n&gt; * **$EXPD** \n&gt; * **$FSLR** \n&gt; * **$STNG** \n&gt; * **$AKS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j9w4IR8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/siAY14P.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

The bullish signal here is due to the massive drop in stock price that is bound to correct itself, in both ST and LT. \n\nAlly Financial is the largest auto lender in the country. They make hella money on interest payments and have a healthy balance sheet. This acquisition and entry to the credit card business is not only to diversify, but it is highly risk-on for the lender. The consumer credit market is super healthy right now, everyone is lending and people are spending because for the present moment, the economy is healthy and people want to buy shit. Think about why all you autists are even on WSB. You have disposable income you can just yolo into RH\n\nCash rich credit card issuers raise capital at stupid cheap levels, and have been crushing it in terms of revenue. For comp sake look at synchrony financials 40% growth in the last year alone in stock. Also look at discover, amex, and visa. \n\nI'm not here saying Ally will moon, but it will definitely correct itself soon. Buy now for strong upside potential. seriously.",

I have the link below.  They talk around 11:00 min about buying an option in gold where the trader gets $35 if the price of gold is above 121 when it is at 124 within the next month.  If the trade turns below 121 they lose $65.  The probability of success of 65%.  Earlier they mention that this 65% gives you a better chance than 50/50 that you would get from buying stocks in general and so trading options is attractive.\n\nHowever, being math-inclined... If we did the trade of gold in the video 100 times this means we would  break-even.  65% chance of success would mean that 65 times there is a  profit of $35 -&gt; 65\\*35=2,275.  This also means that 35 times in the  100 times there is a loss of $65 -&gt; 35\\*65=2,275.  So, there is a  profit of 2,275 and a loss of 2,275 and we break even.

However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLook out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,\u201d Michelle Meyer, Bank of America\u2019s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. \u201cIt will take time for the \u2018hard\u2019 economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Weekend action?\n&gt; The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed\u2019s March policy meeting.\n*****\n&gt; Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. \u201cISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide \u201cearly insight\u201d into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.\n*****\n&gt; Cutting forecasts\n&gt; Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.\n*****\n&gt; Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&amp;P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.\n*****\n&gt; To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,\u201d Paulsen said.\n*****\n&gt; Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including \u201cbond king\u201d Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xxV96kn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3XfCFrl.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/zbhTBQr.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zASmUSl.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wv7Xef1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qPOD5uN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2z1n5iA.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jgqhUBR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4awCCsW.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ElXoU2T.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xH2GYRk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/HyXxrSJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/GIw7Oq6.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19\n\n&gt; The coronavirus outbreak\u2014or Covid-19 \u2014has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&amp;P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cGiven that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.\u201d\n\n&gt; Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.\n\n&gt; **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3\u20134 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter\u2014possibly 2\u20133% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5\u20136%\u2014followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China\u2019s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government\u2019s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China\u2019s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25\u20130.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy\u2014the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date\u2014may comprise 0.2\u20130.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.\n\n*****\n\n# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?\n\n&gt; It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.\n\n&gt; Of the 97 S&amp;P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&amp;P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&amp;P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**\n\n&gt; Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-Bear-Markets.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&amp;P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off\n\n&gt; Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&amp;P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**\n\n&gt; Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&amp;P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**\n\n&gt; While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Biggest-Change-yield-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)\n\n&gt; It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**\n\n&gt; Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**\n\n&gt; The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**\n\n&gt; Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**\n\n&gt; This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RIY-CYTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs\n\n&gt; The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.\n\n&gt; At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&amp;P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&amp;P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&amp;P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**\n\n&gt; On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.\n\n&gt; One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Decliners.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 28th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkYpcmapyKs))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.1.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQM7SrVGFvY))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$PLUG** \n&gt; * **$JD** \n&gt; * **$ZM** \n&gt; * **$COST** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$AZO** \n&gt; * **$KSS** \n&gt; * **$SPLK** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$XRAY** \n&gt; * **$SE** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$FOLD** \n&gt; * **$KR** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$STNE** \n&gt; * **$BLDP** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$CIEN** \n&gt; * **$ALBO** \n&gt; * **$MAXR** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$ITCI** \n&gt; * **$FNKO** \n&gt; * **$JWN** \n&gt; * **$EPRT** \n&gt; * **$VIPS** \n&gt; * **$GTT** \n&gt; * **$CORE** \n&gt; * **$BNFT** \n&gt; * **$LVGO** \n&gt; * **$EVRG** \n&gt; * **$ROST** \n&gt; * **$EGRX** \n&gt; * **$AOBC** \n&gt; * **$TGLS** \n&gt; * **$ATRS** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$NWN** \n&gt; * **$WVE** \n&gt; * **$WSC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/x29nduD.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WpXhdqA.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ycdhPpa.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VIBwP3J.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0CU1CX3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BCVHMu2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6EsJdZf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3YUYSb9.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M3Hifok.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0W1FLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.6.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n# Target Corp. $103.00\n&gt; **Target Corp.

Time passing moves the bull right. He flys majestically higher and higher! Bulls love eating grass. (more than I love sucking cock) With his head pointing downward to eat (probably tendies) he increases his efficiency while and allowing more velocity to run under his dick which naturally forces him upwards at a  steady pace. When he is done eating and just chillin\u2019. (probably watching bears masturbating in the woods) His head then rises causing a disruption in downforce. This cause the bull to shoot upwards almost in a parabolic nature! (Just like the last three months)",

The bullish signal here is due to the massive drop in stock price that is bound to correct itself, in both ST and LT.\n\nAlly Financial is the largest auto lender in the country. They make hella money on interest payments and have a healthy balance sheet. This acquisition and entry to the credit card business is not only to diversify, but it is highly risk-on for the lender. The consumer credit market is super healthy right now, everyone is lending and people are spending because for the present moment, the economy is healthy and people want to buy shit. Think about why all you autists are even on WSB. You have disposable income you can just yolo into RH\n\nCash rich credit card issuers raise capital at stupid cheap levels, and have been crushing it in terms of revenue. For comp sake look at synchrony financials 40% growth in the last year alone in stock. Also look at discover, amex, and visa.\n\nI'm not here saying Ally will moon, but it will definitely correct itself soon. Buy now for strong upside potential. seriously.",

Well, I think odds of a large outbreak in the US are now high. So really it is about the odds of whether a large outbreak leads to recession. Maybe once it is a global pandemic they give up trying to slow it. But 5% of cases will die without serious medical intervention so they need to try to slow it down to prevent health service being overwhelmed. So I think they cannot just prioritise economy over disease containment.",

        "selftext": "Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I've been invested in Tesla for a while and would like to know that you guys think. Since there's sentiment that the bull case for Tesla assumes the success of the semi (which could be potentially huge), I'd like to share some analysis.\n\nOn Tesla's website, the semi is listed with a range of 500 mi range at &lt;2kWh per mile at $180k. That means the battery pack has, at max, 1000 kWh of energy.\n\nWith a back of the envelope calculation assuming 70 mph, level road driving, drag coeff. of .36 (which is best case scenario), .0045 rolling coeff. (also best case scenario), 80,000 lb total load, at sea level (air density = 1.225 kg/m\\^3):\n\n* Aero force = Q\\*Cd\\*S = .5\\*1.225\\*(31.2928 m/s)\\^2\\*.36\\*10 m\\^2 = 2,159 Newtons\n* Rolling resistance force = N\\*Crr = 36287.39 kg\\*9.81 m/s\\^2\\*.0045 = 1,602 Newtons\n\nThe semi must overcome those combined forces to do work, and the energy equation here is E=F\\*d.\n\n* Energy required = (Aero force + Rolling resist. force)\\*dist. = 3,761 Newtons \\* 804672 m = 3.027 \\*10\\^9 Joules = **841 kWh**\n\nIt seems, at the very minimum, the battery back needs to be 841 kWh **based on physics**. That is assuming level ground, no acceleration or deceleration, normal temperature, best case aerodynamics, best case rolling resistance.\n\nI feel like a 159 kWh buffer to account for temperature variations, going up hill, etc. isn't enough. What if the trailer isn't the type that is completely flush with the truck (like the ones that transport cars). This will drastically affect aero. What if there are rear view mirrors? These do not cause insignificant drag. What if the tires aren't maintained well? Etc. There are many off nominal cases to account for.\n\nI'm not entirely sure they can pull off a 500 mi range based on these assumptions. Thoughts? Criticisms?\n\nReferences:\n\nMath from Engineering Explained: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJL9MasBFvM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJL9MasBFvM) \n\nRolling resistance coeff: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling\\_resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_resistance)",

        "selftext": " \n\nI'd  like to share some thoughts to help me straighten my thoughts because  this is an extremely difficult juncture. I'll try to be very concise.\n\nNarrative  is focused 100% on a few hundred cases in some in and around Italy, for  most traders that is the beginning but in the context of the broader  implications of COVID19, if it was gonna kill US mkts it would have done  so when Wuhan quarantined 11m productive consumers and locked supply  chain for an unforeseen amount of time. Even the DAX which is extremely  exposed to Wuhan was at an ATH of 13800. instead we had a quick V shaped  dip in the US and even FXI / KWEB recovered (not without the national  team but that's another story)\n\nMy  explanation as to what was happening was that as long as bonds kept  rallying so much (TLT) it was fine to keep the equity as the central  bankers had our back and there's nothing that the nasdaq loves more than  lower real rates ($TIP &amp; $GLD)\n\nSuddenly  the actual fed chair, Richard Clarida gave an interview to S.Liesmann  where he essentially told the mkt to back off cuz it ain't happening\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/25/fed-vice-chair-clarida-says-its-still-too-soon-to-tell-how-much-coronavirus-will-impact-growth.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/25/fed-vice-chair-clarida-says-its-still-too-soon-to-tell-how-much-coronavirus-will-impact-growth.html)\n\nhe's also sending his homies to relay the same message, ie just now :\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kaplan-unclear-right-now-coronavirus-calls-for-rate-change-11582670163](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kaplan-unclear-right-now-coronavirus-calls-for-rate-change-11582670163)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAnd  see that's a huge problem because even if you take the Nasdaq which is  the best index in the world as far as fundamentals go the valuation  doesn't make sense historically unless u consider &lt; 0 real rate that  we were pricing in. if the guy doesn't cut to where we expect him to cut  (2 cuts) then the real rate is around 50bps and we've never had Spooz  trading at 19x NTM PE with 50bps real rate and gold at 1700 suddenly  makes no sense at all.\n\nSo my thinking is that this dude spoiled the one thing which made the mkt not fall on a number of bearish items :\n\n* Extremely strong $ which is negative to earnings for big nasdaq names\n* Bank  names holding up way better than they ought to given what the curve was  doing assuming great US consumer (KRE is down 4% today)\n* AAPL/SMH universe supply chain disruptions in Wuhan\n* Comrade sanders gaining groud was dismissed by mkt participants as having no chance vs the Don\n\nAnd now it suddenly all came to the forefront, crystallized in this italian pasta flu bullshit.\n\nSo  now what's next, i think we can have a V shaped recovery because  Chinamen have done an outstanding work containing the disease and  getting back to work asap + they have spared no effort in liquidity and  fiscal measures to help, unlike the fed here.\n\nAt  worst this becomes a more dangerous type of seasonal flu and we get on  on our lives. Nasdaq earnings for one are extremely good  but if the FED  doesn't want to help\n\nBut it won't  happen if the fed keeps pushing back against what is priced in the mkt  (&gt;2 cuts by year end)  so yeah, i have so many reasons to buy the  nasdaq here but i think it makes sense to stay prudent because unless  Clarida concedes very soon, it will soon mean that the 2yr rate will  have to get back to &gt;1.5 and it is simply impossible for equities to  rally in front of that.\n\nAlso you cannot trade here without differentiating btwn timezones:\n\nOne  thing that is certain is that Europeans came on board on the FED  argument, that's why the selling has been so harsh during EZ timezones,  in fact all of yesterday's loss came from them. US Simply managed to  keep it flat and only sold today.\n\nAsian  seems to be the only timezone where you can express some bullishness  and i will be trying to that however there is one issue which is  extremely problematic for the Nikkei (and can pull down all indexes with  it) and that's the Tokyo Olympics, let's just say that a lot of hope  rests on it in Japan and tonight's session will depend on how they  interpret this news item\n\n[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/25/national/senior-member-says-ioc-three-months-decide-fate-tokyo-olympics/#.XlV7dkpCdPY](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/25/national/senior-member-says-ioc-three-months-decide-fate-tokyo-olympics/#.XlV7dkpCdPY)\n\nTLDR:\n\n**so  for now i will try a long in Asian session. and would short into  strength in EU/US Sessions as long as Fed doesn't change it's mind.**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291cHBjPndw))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Coronavirus fears spoiled a solid earnings season and will further dominate markets ahead\u2019  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-fears-ruin-solid-earnings-season-and-cloud-growth-picture.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The coronavirus outbreak ruined for investors what was a solid earnings reporting season and is casting a pall on forecasts for this quarter and the rest of this year. And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month.\n*****\n&gt; Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&amp;P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline.\n*****\n&gt; However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe virus is totally underrated,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said on Friday.\u201cWhat I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we\u2019re paying too much for stocks.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # \u2018More cautious than usual\u2019\n&gt; Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,\u201d Subramanian said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet. These companies\u2019 average revenue exposure to China is 7.2%, compared to 4.8% exposure for the average S&amp;P 500 company.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday, China\u2019s National Health Commission reported more than 75,000 confirmed cases and over 2,000 deaths on the mainland. South Korea has also reported more than 200 cases. Meanwhile, World health officials said the outbreak in Iran is \u201cvery worrisome.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cLost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season,\u201d John Lynch, LPL Financial\u2019s chief investment strategist, said in a note. \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ePo2a9q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ClwuPuJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jpEvLyH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/flHhHRv.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HyjYjBt.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/XCThMbQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TN0RBSk.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ixAr7Su.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ncauH0T.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/x4XfkyA.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/yeknvyf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/hOU10RV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Observations\n\n&gt; The recent news that technology giant Apple would miss its fourth quarter 2020 revenue targets has understandably increased investor anxiety surrounding the potential economic impact of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19). Lost in those headlines is corporate America\u2019s impressive performance this earnings season.\n\n&gt; \u201cCompanies have done an admirable job growing profits considering stiff headwinds,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cDespite slowing global economic growth, weakness in capital investment and manufacturing, a strong US dollar, and a huge drop in energy sector profits, S&amp;P 500 companies are impressively grinding out 1-2 percentage points of overall earnings growth.\u201d The fourth quarter earnings growth may cement the third quarter of 2019 as the trough, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Some highlights of this earnings season:\n\n&gt; * **Solid revenue upside**. A solid 65% of S&amp;P 500 Index companies have beaten revenue estimates, the highest level since second quarter 2018 and well above the long-term average at 57%. S&amp;P 500 companies have produced a larger-than-normal nearly one percentage point positive revenue surprise and are tracking to a 3.5% top-line increase.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/revenue-tracking-nicely-ahead-of-expectations-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Respectable earnings upside despite headwinds**. The earnings beat rate at 71% is slightly above the 10-year average (70%). S&amp;P 500 earnings growth has surprised by a solid 4.4% so far despite economic, currency, and commodity headwinds.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corporate-america-grinding-out-small-earnings-gain-in-q4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; * **Consider the energy drag**. Though 1-2% overall earnings growth isn\u2019t much, the gain is approximately 4%, excluding the energy sector.\n&gt; * ** Sector standout**. One of the most China-exposed sectors produced one of the biggest upside earnings surprises: Technology. Technology sector earnings growth is tracking to a 5% year-over-year increase, about 9 percentage points above prior estimates.\n&gt; * **Reassuring outlooks**. Estimates for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share in 2020 have only fallen by about 0.9% since December 31, 2019. Though these numbers may come down a bit more in the coming days and the China situation remains fluid, this modest reduction reflects U.S. companies\u2019 resilience overall amid significant supply chain disruptions.\n\n*****\n\n# Election Year March: Performance Haunted By Steep 1980 Declines\n\n&gt; Boisterous March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to \u201cbeware the Ides of March\u201d but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.\n\n&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March is somewhat above average in election years with advances 64.7% of the time with a 1.0% average DJIA gain since 1952. S&amp;P 500 has also advanced 64.7% of the time since 1952, but gains have been slightly better at 1.2%, on average. NASDAQ has not fared well in March in election years since 1972. Due to a 17.1% loss in 1980, March is NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month of the election year. Similarly, March 1980\u2019s steep losses adversely affect Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indices.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9950c2a54b4059c3ffe0481a83cf281a/573a7bf3eae7af17-3d/s400x600/7703526bf6d4a2214d4e4b75883edec7f23d56af.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance Throughout The Presidencies\n\n&gt; As markets were closed to observe Presidents Day yesterday and the 2020 Presidential election continues to ramp up, we thought it would be a good time to check up on stock performance during different administrations. In the table below, we show the performance of the Dow during the administrations of every US president since 1900 in addition to the annualized return. In the time since President Trump was sworn into office, the Dow has risen 46.9%. On an annualized basis, the 13.3% return places the current administration in 3rd place for the strongest performance. Only the Clinton administration in the 1990s and Coolidge administration in the 1920s have observed stronger annualized gains. The one caveat of course is that President Trump's term (or terms) has yet to end. Comparing Democratic and Republican administrations since 1900, Democratic presidencies have tended to average stronger returns than their Republican peers, so the stock market's returns under President Trump have deviated somewhat from the norm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-Presidents1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it is impossible to say what a candidate's election will mean for the market, at the moment betting markets favor the incumbent to win the presidency while Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg go back and forth in taking the number 2 spot, hovering around 15%-16%. Come Super Tuesday (March 3rd) when we could finally see more clarity on the Democratic side, the back and forth between Bloomberg and Sanders might become more one-sided.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021820-EBO.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yet Another Corona Friday\n\n&gt; The major indices decided it was five o'clock somewhere right off the bat today as they experience yet another \"Corona Friday\". More concerns around the coronavirus have sent stocks lower with the S&amp;P 500 down around 1.1% as of this writing and the Nasdaq down nearly 2% today. Declines on a Friday have become par for the course in 2020. Fridays have been the weakest day of the week so far in 2020; the only one to average a decline. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 0.52% on Fridays while the next worst day has been Monday which has averaged a gain of 0.19%. Fridays have also been the day that the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher the least. Only 28.6% of Fridays this year have seen the S&amp;P 500 finish in the green. That compares to a positive close more than three-quarters of the time on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. While it has averaged a gain of 0.24%, Tuesdays have also experienced a positive close less than half of the time.

All three indexes are well above their respective historical averages for this time of an election year. NASDAQ has in fact already exceeded its average full election year performance going back to 1972. Bullish sentiment and momentum appear to be firmly in place and historical election year patterns suggests strength could easily continue for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 into May. NASDAQ\u2019s surge higher could be vulnerable to a retreat sooner, in March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/baea2768b612eb15dbd047fbc0cff07b/5100d48ef25e7c53-d2/s500x750/10e181f3beef5c191c7ec0ad2bf7e50a0e449324.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Dow Without Boeing (BA)\n\n&gt; For more than a year now, Boeing (BA) has been plagued by the 737 MAX crisis which has weighed on shares of the plane manufacturer with it now currently down nearly 20% from when the initial groundings took place on March 10th of last year. Despite this, while underperforming the broader market due to the 737 issues, the stock is actually still up just over 5% since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; Even though BA has lagged, it is still the highest-priced of the 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. Currently trading around $338.50, the only stocks in the index holding a candle to BA are Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH), which also trade north of $300 per share. That means these stocks have the highest weighting in the index and therefore have a much larger impact than other stocks on the Dow's performance.\n\n&gt; With BA's issues, a number of people have pondered the what-ifs for the Dow had the company not had the issues with the 737. Would we have already broken out the Dow 30K hats were it not for BA? In the chart below, we show the actual performance of the DJIA and have overlaid the performance of an 'alternate Dow' showing its performance if BA had not been in the index since the start of 2019. We used the start of 2019 instead of the actual date of the groundings as it is a little less arbitrary. By our calculations, while we would be a bit closer, even if BA wasn't in the index since the start of 2019, we wouldn't quite be at Dow 30K yet. As shown, our alternate Dow would be almost 1% or 266 points higher if Boeing was not included in the index since the start of 2019.\n\n&gt; While BA has been a drag on the DJIA since last March, it also provided a big boost to the index in early 2018 before the 737 issues hit the stock. In fact, at the start of March 2017, BA was up over 36% YTD and the spread between the Dow's performance with and without BA was around 700 points in the other direction as it is now!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow-wo-BA-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Another example of this dynamic in which high priced stocks have a greater impact on the index was observed on Tuesday when Apple's (AAPL) stock fell after the company warned that Q1 revenues would be shy of prior guidance due to the coronavirus. The warnings sent shares down over 3% at its intraday lows, but the stock only finished down 1.83%. While there were equivalent or larger declines like Dow (DOW) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in Tuesday's session, AAPL's declines by far weighed on the index more than any other stock. Of the Dow's 165.89 point decline, AAPL contributed 40.35 points. Fortunately, UNH helped to mitigate some of those losses as it had a positive impact on the index of +22.79 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021920-Dow2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXVxywH87mg))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BYND**\n&gt; * **$SQ** \n&gt; * **$HD** \n&gt; * **$SPCE** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$M** \n&gt; * **$CRON** \n&gt; * **$CHK** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$TTD** \n&gt; * **$AMRN** \n&gt; * **$SHAK** \n&gt; * **$KOS** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$ILPT** \n&gt; * **$CLVS** \n&gt; * **$TNDM** \n&gt; * **$IQ** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$CRI** \n&gt; * **$SPNS** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$CTB** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$TREE** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$GWPH** \n&gt; * **$W** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$WEN** \n&gt; * **$CROX** \n&gt; * **$DIN** \n&gt; * **$DNR** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$DORM** \n&gt; * **$GH** \n&gt; * **$OXY** \n&gt; * **$MGI** \n&gt; * **$AMT** \n&gt; * **$JCP** \n&gt; * **$CBRL**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DjB46T2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/qvtfNhx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2020!](https://i.imgur.com/kpCRctt.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3PTK97f.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 2.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eNbMCOD.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qV7qy6J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eNgrHgV.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 2.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FopcLUz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2yyK6HI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dsgBu6B.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 2.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9VYkHyk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/5mFOqR0.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rd8JhvX.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WrX9hNT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 2.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jsCwSCH.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/fzm6EPP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lKtvBHM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 2.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Beyond Meat, Inc. $117.45\n&gt; **Beyond Meat, Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.\n*****\n&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.\n*****\n&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.\n*****\n&gt; China\u2019s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.\n*****\n&gt; # Correction or pull back?\n&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January\u2019s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFebruary is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it\u2019s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. \u201cI call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,\u201d said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s a good possibility, just based on valuation\u2014over 19.6 times forward earnings. That\u2019s the most since 2002,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.\u201d A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,\u201d said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. \u201cWe believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.\u201d Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI still think it\u2019s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don\u2019t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn\u2019t really change my view,\u201d she said. \u201cI still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said it\u2019s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders\u2019 policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOnly 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing\u2019s production shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said he\u2019s watching \u201ca combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become \u201cinverted.\u201d An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China\u2019s economy and the world economy.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ms7pnyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ojanFLC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/6pUu4Wt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eVWWwMR.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jNie8v1.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zW7mKhV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PhHG14b.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ng9rAYd.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQNRK2N.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/awNfHLy.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZR9zSwK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywB5fTk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/XqNLwhI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zNWfUQ1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!\n\n&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**\n\n&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-US-Indices-1024x498.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Short Circuit\n\n&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 49ers Or Chiefs?\n\n&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but \u201cdata don\u2019t lie\u201d: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.\n\n&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC\u2014and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.\n\n&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThere have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we\u2019re glad the Patriots aren\u2019t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.\n\n*****\n\n# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm\n\n&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October\u2014spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index\u2019s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven\u2019t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn\u2019t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWhile economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002\u20132003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.\u201d\n\n&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.\n\n&gt; We certainly don\u2019t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003\u2014several months into the 2003\u20132007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.\n\n*****\n\n# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months\n\n&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979\u2014just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February\u2019s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus\n\n&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.\n\n&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.\n\n&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.\n\n&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.\n\n&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.\n\n&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.\n\n&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/780a4e844cd0844caec4ab4740bc2317/4920c4dbd675407c-06/s500x750/f1421a0eb80bd75fbf0a6a2624c71c8d3a9c5327.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291cHBjPndw))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

(watch TSLA Short Video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6wmKqEQn8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt6wmKqEQn8) ) - To fully understand the NVDA Trade Idea\n\nThe following Catalyst can be summed up in one formula based on the slowing growth in the US Economy - = Current Account = US National Savings - Investments (watch the economic forecast vid [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_lt5b\\_l7Tmk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lt5b_l7Tmk) )\n\nThe excessive run-up, algo driven, Federal Reserve QE Lite, excessive multiple expansion, and run-up in the first half of the year is likely to end in a very messy meltdown. Feel free to respond if you disagree, but this is presenting a great opportunity for traders who see this most recent upside push as completely unsustainable. If you liked to disagree feel free, but please limit the name-calling and state your difference in opinion, but for now, any traders wanting to take a risk on calling the TOP can do so via this trade on NVDA. I am suggesting both Writing against NVDA that you may hold or taking a step further out along the risk curve and writing naked against NVDA stock you do not hold. The latter of the two ideas is extremely risky but given the idiosyncratic ups and downs in the price of this stock may prove to be extremely profitable over the next 180 days.\n\n \n\nTraderfirstyear - $NVDA Trade Buy Write or Naked Write is back on as the meltdown will be within at least 180 days. This trade is good until May 2020 - Why? NVDA valuation is stretched &amp; it is a high beta stock with a very high implied volatility.

I wouldn't call it a cult as others would say, but more so a passionate following.\n\n+ From there, I really find it hard to justify shorting Tesla, would you guys agree or disagree, and what reasons do you have for your beliefs?",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m going to rant for a minute but bear with me cause this will eventually reach an actual point.\n\nLet me just start that the only reason I\u2019m bothering with typing this is because my doc just told me my pneumonia came back for a third time. He tells me it\u2019s cause of my asthma. Oh yeah, that\u2019s right, the pneumonia apparently triggered my inner gay boy asthma that I had no clue I had. Nationally ranked athlete from 2015-2018 by the way. How the fuck do I have asthma?! This shit has me more heated then Trump\u2019s social media team.\n\nThen there\u2019s this shit- https://imgur.com/gallery/jGKO3RE. Fuck this dip. Fuck that 4k anyways. I\u2019d pay triple that to have this biblical flood of bullshit removed from my lungs permanently. \n\nI thought Not-QE would be stronger than a bunch of pussy farts freaking out over a fancy flu. If that is even what is occurring- more on that in a moment. Unlike you mouth breathers I actually know what a goddamn CoronaVirus looks like and how it acts. Let me tell you the real issue mother fuckers-\n\nI\u2019ve been to China. Almost five months total as a specialized Biotech/Biochem Researcher. Beijing, Xi\u2019an, Wuhan and Gongzhu. I\u2019ve seen some shit. The country is a giant health code violation. Forget the virus issue- the real issue is this country is ran by incompetent assholes that hold no real regulations or health standards.\n\nI remember taking the subway in Xi\u2019an once. Cameras everywhere. Guards Everywhere. They have security but no method of filtration for the public has they come in. So the Guards literally just try to quickly wave people with wands as they walk by- I kid you not it usually just looks like they\u2019re just fucking around. Anyways, I\u2019m down there, in a sea of brown eyed, brown haired, short fucks- when this guards wand actually goes off. Alarm triggers. I\u2019m thinking oh damn shit is about to go down, so I pull out my phone and fling up my camera like the asshole I am- nothing happens. The only thing I caught on camera was this drilling retard staring at the wand like it had malfunctioned instead of doing its job.\n\nThe entire country is like this. Almost everyone is a cunt. The non cunts get ran over by tanks, mysteriously disappear, or move to America and get made fun of for having big wallets and small dicks. True enough.\n\nThese other countries with outbreaks? Also a bunch of cunts. You think the CoronaVirus is especially elusive- why? Cause you read half the title of a buzzfeed article? Go fuck yourself. This isn\u2019t about a virus, this is about shitty countries that can\u2019t take care of their populations health because they\u2019re ran by assholes.\n\nThis whole worry about companies losing supply chain cause of China quarantines? Honest opinion? Good. Fuck them for getting so greedy they relocated their distribution to China to profit off horrendous pay and working conditions. What a bunch of cunts. They shot themselves in the foot years ago- it was only a matter of time before the shit caught up to them. Same with India. You just wait til that country gets fucked up too and suddenly every customer service line worldwide gets fucked. I pray it can at least just kill off the scammers first.\n\nThis shit has never been about a virus and trust me, even if this bitch was genetically modified I guarantee it wasn\u2019t done well. And even if it had been- reverse engineering a cure is much easier when you wrote the blueprint. There are plenty of ways to create a more potent virus and hell you could even theoretically grow it into food using a similar system to what I worked on in college. Google \u2018Edible Vaccines\u2019 if you want to know more on how fucked you would be if someone actually wanted to fuck you. And that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg. Google Super Virus- 100x the genetic content just recombining themselves endless like a tunic cube trying to solve the code to a supermassive plague. And if that\u2019s not even to make your balls insert themselves into your stomach- do some reading on living viruses. Oh you didn\u2019t know that was a thing? Neither did we until recently. End of the day- we don\u2019t know shit. \n\nYou degenerate economists don\u2019t understand anything beyond financials and money flow. You forget we\u2019re dealing with fragile, greedy, fickle assholes known as human beings. They all think they know shit and want to run shit. At the end of the day we\u2019re all fucking morons. Fuck this dip. Fuck my potential 4K losses. Fuck drug companies. Fuck market movers.\n\nAnd fuck pneumonia- I wish I had a bitch ass CoronaVirus.\n\nPositions:\nMSFT 190 3/20 \nV 215 3/27\nDIS 145 3/20",
